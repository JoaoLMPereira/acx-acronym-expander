20483780,"Gender-specific expression of beta1 integrin of VLA-4 in myelin basic protein-primed T cells: implications for gender bias in multiple sclerosis.Susceptibility to multiple sclerosis is higher in females than males. However, the underlying mechanism behind this gender difference is poorly understood. Because the presence of neuroantigen-primed T cells in the CNS is necessary to initiate the neuroinflammatory cascade of multiple sclerosis, we first investigated how these T cells interacted with astroglia, major resident glial cells of the CNS. Interestingly, we found that myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-primed T cells from female and castrated male mice, but not from male mice, produced proinflammatory molecules, such as NO, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in astroglia, and these responses were purely via contact between T cells and astroglia. Because T cell:glia contact requires several integrin molecules, we examined the involvement of integrins in this process. Both alpha4 and beta1, subunits of VLA-4 integrin, were found to be necessary for T cell contact-induced generation of proinflammatory molecules in astroglia. Interestingly, the expression of beta1, but not alpha4, was absent in male MBP-primed T cells. In contrast, female and castrated male MBP-primed T cells expressed both alpha4 and beta1. Similarly, we also detected beta1 in spleen of normal young female, but not male, mice. Furthermore, we show that male sex hormones (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone), but not female sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone), were able to suppress the mRNA expression of beta1 in female MBP-primed T cells. These studies suggest that beta1, but not alpha4, integrin of VLA-4 is the sex-specific molecule on T cell surface, and that the presence or absence of beta1 determines gender-specific T cell contact-mediated glial activation.",M1
20417619,"Hypoxia during pregnancy in rats leads to the changes of the cerebral white matter in adult offspring.The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of reduced fetal oxygen supply on cerebral white matter in the adult offspring and further assess its susceptibility to postnatal hypoxia and high-fat diet. Based on a 3 x 2 full factorial design consisting of three factors of maternal hypoxia, postnatal high-fat diet, and postnatal hypoxia, the ultrastructure of myelin, axon and capillaries were observed, and the expression of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), neurofilament-H+L(NF-H+L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was analyzed in periventricular white matter of 16-month-old offspring. Demyelination, injured axon and damaged microvasculars were observed in maternal hypoxia offspring. The main effect of maternal hypoxia lead to decreased expression of MBP or NF-H+L, and increased expression of GFAP (all P&lt;0.05). Moreover, there was positive three-way interaction among maternal hypoxia, high-fat diet and postnatal hypoxia on MBP, NF-H+L or GFAP expression (all P&lt;0.05). In summary, our results indicated that maternal hypoxia during pregnancy in rats lead to changes of periventricular white matter in adult offspring, including demyelination, damaged axon and proliferated astroglia. This effect was amplified by high-fat diet and postnatal hypoxia.",M1
20383810,"Recombinant forms of myelin antigens expressed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a tool for identification of autoantibodies in serum of multiple sclerosis patients.A contribution of B cells and autoantibodies has been demonstrated in MS leading to interest in the use of such autoantibodies as diagnostic or prognostic markers and as a basis for immunomodulatory therapy. ELISA and Western fail to detect reactivity against epitopes displayed by native antigens expressed on myelin sheats. We describe a cell-based assay that specifically identifies serum antibodies directed against three major myelin autoantigens: <e>MBP</e>, PLP and MOG. The method detects antibody binding to recombinant antigens in their native conformation on MBP, PLP and MOG transfected mammalian (hamster ovary) cells. 36 patients with relapsing-remitting MS diagnosed according to criteria of McDonald were recruited. Age 38.2 and duration of the disease 7.1. Serum anti-MBP, anti-PLP and anti-MOG IgG autoantibodies were detected in MS patients and 35 healthy donors by FACS analysis. Compared with healthy controls the titres of IgG autoantibodies directed against membrane-bound recombinant myelin antigens were most significantly increased for PLP, no quite significant for MBP and not significant for MOG. The titres of anti-MBP antibodies were low in contrast to high titre of anti-MOG antibodies in both groups suggesting a nonspecific binding. The cell-based assay detection of autoantibodies directed against recombinant myelin antigens could be a useful tool providing the serological markers in diagnosis and progression of MS. Indeed, it could allow obtaining molecular characteristics of disease in each patient in term of an antibody response against certain myelin and non-myelin antigens. We have shown that in RRMS patients elevated level of serum antibodies against PLP is significant, what should be considered in search for specific immunomodulatory therapy in MS.",M1
20353813,"Structure and expression of myelin basic protein gene products in Xenopus laevis.To study roles of the myelin basic protein (<e>mbp</e>) gene products in nervous system development, cDNA cloning and expression analyses were performed in Xenopus laevis. We cloned cDNAs for XMBP.1 and XMBP.2 encoded by xmbp.1 and xmbp.2 genes, respectively. We also identified xmbp.1 gene transcripts encoding three XGolli (X.laevis gene of the oligodendrocyte lineage) proteins, XBG21.1, XJ37.1, and XTP8.1, which are homologues of mouse BG21, J37, and TP8, respectively. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses, the XMBP, XJ37, and XTP8 mRNAs were expressed in brain, ovaries, testes, and/or thymus in frogs and in larvae after hatching. In contrast, the XBG21 mRNA was found fairly ubiquitously in adult tissues, unfertilized eggs and embryos throughout the developmental stages examined. Western blot analyses using three different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) showed that the central and peripheral myelin contained 20kDa and18.5 kDa XMBP variants. In addition, XMBP was found in thymus by Western blotting and in thymocyte cytoplasm immunocytochemically. However, the XGolli protein, most provably XBG21, was detectable only in testes. The results indicate that the structure of xmbp gene products seems highly conserved among amphibians and mammals, although their expression patterns and thus physiological roles may partially differ. This is the first report that systematically describes the mbp gene products in nonmammalian vertebrates.",M1
20334434,"Myelin basic protein and myelin protein 2 act synergistically to cause stacking of lipid bilayers.Saltatory conduction of nerve impulses along axonal membranes depends on the presence of a multilayered membrane, myelin, that wraps around the axon. Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) and myelin protein 2 (P2) are intimately involved in the generation of the myelin sheath. They are also implicated in a number of neurological diseases, including autoimmune diseases of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we have used atomic force microsopy (AFM) to study the effects of MBP and P2 on lipid bilayers. MBP in association with a mica substrate appeared unstructured, and tended to coat the mica surface in the form of a monolayer. In contrast, P2 appeared as discrete particles, with molecular volumes consistent with the formation of both monomers and dimers. Either MBP or P2, at micromolar concentrations, caused stacking of brain lipid bilayers. This stacking effect was significantly potentiated when both proteins were added together. Bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were stacked by MBP, provided that cholesterol was also present; in contrast, P2 did not stack PC/PS/cholesterol bilayers. Hence, the bilayer stacking effects of the two proteins have different lipid requirements.",M1
20205471,"Differential effects of divalent manganese and magnesium on the kinase activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2).Various mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been linked to susceptibility for both familial and idiopathic late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of <e>MBP</e> and LRRKtide by the LRRK2 G2019S mutant was activated by Mn(2+) in vitro. This enhanced G2019S kinase activity was due to the combination of an increase in kinase and a decrease in ATPase activity by Mn(2+). Compared to 10 mM Mg(2+), 1 mM Mn(2+) reduced ATP K(m) for G2019S from 103 to 1.8 muM and only modestly reduced k(cat) (2.5-fold); as a result, the Mn(2+) increased its k(cat)/K(m) by 22-fold. This change in ATP K(m) was due in large part to an increase in nucleotide affinity. While Mn(2+) also increased ATP affinity and had similar effects on k(cat)/K(m) for LRRK2 WT and R1441C enzymes, it reduced their k(cat) values significantly by 13-17-fold. Consequently, the difference in the kinase activity between G2019S and other LRRK2 variants was enhanced from about 2-fold in Mg(2+) to 10-fold in Mn(2+) at saturating ATP concentrations relative to its K(m). Furthermore, while Mg(2+) yielded optimal V(max) values at Mg(2+) concentration greater than 5 mM, the optimal Mn(2+) concentration for activating LRRK2 catalysis was in the micromolar range with increasing Mn(2+) above 1 mM causing a decrease in enzyme activity. Finally, despite the large but expected differences in IC(50) tested at 100 muM ATP, the apparent K(i) values of a small set of LRRK2 ATP-competitive inhibitors were within 5-fold between Mg(2+)- and Mn(2+)-mediated reactions except AMP-CPP, an ATP analogue.",M1
20184788,"Functional recovery after the transplantation of neurally differentiated mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone barrow in a rat model of spinal cord injury.This study was designed to investigate functional recovery after the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or neurally differentiated MSCs (NMSCs) derived from bone marrow in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to incomplete SCI using an NYU impactor to create a free drop contusion at the T9 level. The SCI rats were then classified into three groups; MSCs, NMSCs, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated groups. The cells or PBS were administrated 1 week after SCI. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scores were measured at 1-week intervals for 9 weeks. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also recorded 8 weeks after transplantation. While transplantation of MSCs led to a clear tendency of motor recovery, NMSC-treated rats had significantly improved BBB scores and showed significantly shortened initial latency, N1 latency, and P1 latency of the SSEPs compared to PBS controls. In addition, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-prelabeled MSCs costained for BrdU and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) were found rostrally and caudally 5 mm each from the epicenter of the necrotic cavity 4 weeks after transplantation. These results suggest that neurally differentiated cells might be an effective therapeutic source for functional recovery after SCI.",M1
20153903,"Long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis with glatiramer acetate: natural history of the subtypes of anti-glatiramer acetate antibodies and their correlation with clinical efficacy.A retrospective phase IV study was designed to evaluate the anti-GA antibody subtypes, test their in vitro neutralizing activity and correlate these parameters with the clinical efficacy, in long-term GA treatment of MS patients. Serum samples from 153 MS patients, 126 treated with GA for 2 to 15 years (mean 6.6 years) and 27 treated for &lt;2 years, were collected. Anti-myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) and anti-GA antibodies were measured by specific ELISA. Neutralizing activity was determined by the capacity of the serum to inhibit the proliferation of GA-specific T-cells. Anti-GA antibodies were detected even after very long treatment periods, although at lower levels. Anti-MBP reactivity remained consistently negative. The IgG2 isotype of anti-GA antibodies and the multiple sclerosis severity scale (MSSS) was lower in the long-term treated patients P=0.0003 and 0.016 respectively. The neutralizing activity of anti-GA antibodies was insignificant. Our results indicate that the clinical efficacy of GA treatment could be associated with a decrease in anti-GA IgG2 isotype in long-term GA-treated patients.",M1
20151197,"Oligodendrocyte development and myelinogenesis are not impaired by high concentrations of phenylalanine or its metabolites.Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic genetic disease characterized by deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzymatic activity. Brain hypomyelination has been reported in untreated patients, but its mechanism remains unclear. We therefore investigated the influence of phenylalanine (Phe), phenylpyruvate (PP), and phenylacetate (PA) on oligodendrocytes. We first showed in a mouse model of PKU that the number of oligodendrocytes is not different in corpus callosum sections from adult mutants or from control brains. Then, using enriched oligodendroglial cultures, we detected no cytotoxic effect of high concentrations of Phe, PP, or PA. Finally, we analyzed the impact of Phe, PP, and PA on the myelination process in myelinating cocultures using both an in vitro index of myelination, based on activation of the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) promoter, and the direct quantification of myelin sheaths by both optical measurement and a bioinformatics method. None of these parameters was affected by the increased levels of Phe or its derivatives. Taken together, our data demonstrate that high levels of Phe, such as in PKU, are unlikely to directly induce brain hypomyelination, suggesting involvement of alternative mechanisms in this myelination defect.",M1
20146174,"Hypoxia-ischemia brain damage disrupts brain cholesterol homeostasis in neonatal rats.PURPOSE:The first 3 weeks of life is the peak time of oligodendrocytes development and also the critical period of cholesterol increasing dramatically in central nervous system in rats. Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain damage happening in this period may disturb the brain cholesterol balance as well as white matter development. MATERIALS AND METHODS:To test this hypothesis, postnatal day 7 (P7) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to HI insult. Cholesterol concentrations from brain and plasma were measured. White matter integrity was evaluated by densitometric analysis of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) immunostaining and electron microscopy. Brain TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were also measured. RESULTS:HI-induced brain cholesterol, but not the plasma cholesterol, levels decreased significantly during the first three days after HI compared with naïve and sham operated rats (p&lt;0.05). Obvious hypomyelination was indicated by marked reductions in MBP immunostaining on both P10 and P14 (p&lt;0.01) and less and thinner myelinated axons were detected on P21 by electron microscopy observation. High expressions of brain TNF-alpha and IL-6 12 h after HI (p&lt;0.05) were also observed. DISCUSSION:The present work provides evidence that HI insult destroyed brain cholesterol homeostasis, which might be important in the molecular pathology of hypoxic-ischemic white matter injury. Proinflammatory cytokines insulting oligodendrocytes, may cause cholesterol unbalance. Furthermore, specific therapeutic interventions to maintain brain cholesterol balance may be effective for the recovery of white matter function.",M1
20143314,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the mouse.This unit details the materials and methods required for both active induction and adoptive transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the SJL mouse strain using intact proteins or peptides from the two major myelin proteins: proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>). Detailed materials and methods required for the purification of both PLP and MBP are also described. A protocol for isolating CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes in EAE mice is included. Modifications of the specified protocols may be necessary for efficient induction of active or adoptive EAE in other mouse strains.",M1
20140960,"Temporal dynamics of myelination in the zebrafish spinal cord.Knowledge of the precise timing of myelination is critical to the success of zebrafish-based in vivo screening strategies for potential remyelination therapies. This study provides a systematic review of the timing of myelination in the zebrafish spinal cord and a critique of techniques by which it may be accurately assessed. The onset of myelination was found to be 3 days postfertilization (d.p.f.); earlier than previously reported. This coincided with the dorsal migration and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the expression of myelin basic protein (<e>Mbp</e>) transcripts and protein. Our data suggests that immunohistochemistry with zebrafish-specific anti-Mbp from 3 d.p.f. is the optimal histological method for myelin visualization, while quantification of myelination is more reliably achieved by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for mbp from 5 d.p.f.. Transgenic fluorescent lines such as olig2:EGFP can be used to assess oligodendrocyte cell number at 3 d.p.f. and the development of new, more specific lines may enable real time visualization of myelin itself. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis revealed that the myelination of zebrafish axons is regulated according to axonal growth and not absolute axonal size. This study confirms the use of the zebrafish larvae as a versatile and efficient in vivo model of myelination and provides a platform on which future myelination screening studies can be based.",M1
20120953,"[Evaluation of the usefulness cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) concentration examination in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis--preliminary study]The aim of the study was evaluation of usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myelin basic protein (MBP) level examination in diagnostics of Lyme neuroborreliosis. The study was performed in 24 subjects. In all individuals CSF MBP concentration was estimated on the 1st day of hospitalization. In patients with depressive and cognitive impairments, proved in neuropsychological tests (group I), mean CSF MBP concentration was 3.1 ng/mL, whereas in subjects without abnormalities in tests (group II), respectively, 1.2 ng/mL. The difference of mean CSF MBP levels was statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). The obtained results indicate usefulness of this CSF parameter, besides neuropsychological tests, in objective evaluation of clinical state in patients with chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis.",M1
20090312,"Effects of dietary folic acid on the expression of myelin basic protein in the brain and spinal cord of pregnant and lactating rats.Background/Aims: This study investigated the effects of dietary folic acid on the expression of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in the maternal brain and spinal cord during pregnancy and lactation. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a folic-acid-supplemented diet (FS, 8 mg/kg diet) or a folic-acid-deficient diet (FD, 0 mg/kg diet) from 2 weeks prior to mating until the end of lactation. The expressions of MBP were analyzed using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and neuronal nuclear antigen by immunohistochemistry. Results: The cerebrocortical expression of MBP was 87% higher at day 20 of pregnancy than before pregnancy in FS animals (p &lt; 0.05) but did not change significantly in FD animals. No significant change was observed in the hippocampus or spinal cord in either dietary treatment group. The cerebrocortical MOG and NeuN expressions were significantly lower in FD animals than in FS animals before pregnancy and increased at day 20 of pregnancy but did not differ with the dietary folic acid level. Conclusions: Folic acid deficiency did not increase the expression level of MBP in the cerebral cortex during pregnancy, suggesting that folate intake during pregnancy plays an important role in the maintenance of myelin.",M1
20083653,"Myelin basic protein priming reduces the expression of Foxp3 in T cells via nitric oxide.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a vital role in autoimmune disorders. Among several markers, forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) is the most specific with regard to Treg activity. Therefore, understanding mechanisms that regulate Foxp3 expression is a critical step for unraveling the complicacy of autoimmune pathophysiology. The present study was undertaken to investigate the crosstalk between NO and Tregs. Interestingly, after myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) priming, the expression of Foxp3 decreased in MBP-primed T cells. However, blocking NO either by inhibiting inducible NO synthase with l-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine hydrochloride or through scavenging with PTIO or by pharmacological drugs, such as pravastatin, sodium benzoate, or gemfibrozil, restored the expression of Foxp3 in MBP-primed T cells. However, this restoration of Foxp3 by pharmacological drugs was reversed by S-nitrosoglutathione, an NO donor. Similarly, NO also decreased the populations of Tregs characterized by CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD25(+)FoxP3(+) phenotypes. We have further confirmed this inverse relationship between NO and Foxp3 by analyzing the mRNA expression of Foxp3 and characterizing CD25(+)FoxP3(+) or CD4(+)Foxp3(+) phenotypes from inducible NO synthase knockout mice. Moreover, this inverse relation between NO and Foxp3 also was observed during priming with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, another target neuroantigen in multiple sclerosis, as well as collagen, a target autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, we demonstrate that NO inhibited the expression of Foxp3 in MBP-primed T cells via soluble guanylyl cyclase-mediated production of cGMP. Taken together, our data imply a novel role of NO in suppressing Foxp3(+) Tregs via the soluble guanylyl cyclase pathway.",M1
20078558,"Delineating the impact of neuroantigen vs genetic diversity on MP4-induced EAE of C57BL/6 and B6.129 mice.<e>MBP</e>-PLP fusion protein (MP4)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model for multiple sclerosis (MS) that encompasses both a time-dependent attack on central nervous system (CNS) regions and a B cell component, mirroring important features of human multiple sclerosis. Comparing C57BL/6 with B6.129 mice immunized with MP4, we point out similarities regarding these hallmarks and thus propose that they are largely dependent on the nature of the MP4 antigen itself, while differences between the two strains suggest that additional fine-tuning is brought about by the genetic repertoire of the animal. Overall, our data imply that (i) the interplay between both the antigenic trigger and genetic variables can define the outcome of MP4-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6 and B6.129 mice and (ii) that MP4 is not only a strong neuroantigen when it comes to reproducing the dynamics in effector mechanisms as is typical of the disease but also a promising agent for studying interindividual heterogeneity derived from genetic diversity in EAE/MS.",M1
20060814,"Sex effects of interleukin-6 deficiency on neuroinflammation in aged C57Bl/6 mice.High levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with an increased risk of dementia in the elderly and can increase neuroinflammation in mice. Dementia is more frequent in females, and IL-6 is regulated by estrogen, suggesting that elevated IL-6 levels may contribute to neuroinflammation and dementia particularly in women. Therefore we hypothesized that IL-6 deficient ((-/-)) female mice would have lower aging-related neuroinflammation than wild type (WT). We quantified neuroinflammatory markers which are affected by aging, and regulated by both estrogen and IL-6; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), interferon gamma (IFNgamma), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and synaptic density (SNAP25) and in IL-6(-/-) and WT C57Bl/6 mice. To determine age effects we used mid-age (18months) and old-age (24months) mice, and to determine region specific effects we used the hippocampus which is impaired in dementia and the cerebellum which is unimpaired in dementia. Unexpectedly, there were no effects of IL-6 deficiency on GFAP, MDA or SNAP25 levels in females, but IL-6 deficiency was associated with lower cerebellar MBP (p&lt;0.05) levels. Interestingly, the old-aged IL-6(-/-) males had higher GFAP and MDA levels (p&lt;0.05) in both the hippocampus and cerebellum, in addition to a greater body weight than WT. We suggest that IL-6 is important for promoting myelin synthesis in aged females, and that drugs which inhibit the synthesis of IL-6 in males may inadvertently affect fatty acid metabolism and augment aging-related neuroinflammation.",M1
20059576,"Prevention and treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with clonotypic CDR3 peptides: CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T-regulatory cells suppress interleukin-2-dependent expansion of myelin basic protein-specific T cells.T-cell receptor (TCR)-derived peptides are recognized by the immune system and are capable of modulating autoimmune responses. Using the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) TCR 1501 transgenic mouse model, we demonstrated that TCR CDR3 peptides from the transgenic TCR can provide a protective effect when therapy is initiated before the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). More importantly, TCR CDR3 peptide therapy can ameliorate the disease when administered after EAE onset. Concurrent with the therapeutic effects, we observed reduced T-cell proliferation and reduced interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in response to stimulation with MBP-85-99 peptide in splenocyte cultures from mice receiving TCR CDR3 peptides compared with that of control mice. Moreover, we found that Foxp3(+) CD4 T cells from mice protected with TCR CDR3 peptide are preferentially expanded in the presence of IL-2. This is supportive of a proposed mechanism where Foxp3(+) T-regulatory cells induced by therapy with MBP-85-99 TCR CDR3 peptides limit expansion and the encephalitogenic activity of MBP-85-99-specific T cells by regulating the levels of secreted IL-2.",M1
20015484,"Slc25a12 disruption alters myelination and neurofilaments: a model for a hypomyelination syndrome and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders.BACKGROUND: SLC25A12, a susceptibility gene for autism spectrum disorders that is mutated in a neurodevelopmental syndrome, encodes a mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 1 [AGC1]). AGC1 is an important component of the malate/aspartate shuttle, a crucial system supporting oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate production. METHODS: We characterized mice with a disruption of the Slc25a12 gene, followed by confirmatory in vitro studies. RESULTS: Slc25a12-knockout mice, which showed no AGC1 by immunoblotting, were born normally but displayed delayed development and died around 3 weeks after birth. In postnatal day 13 to 14 knockout brains, the brains were smaller with no obvious alteration in gross structure. However, we found a reduction in myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-positive fibers, consistent with a previous report. Furthermore, the neocortex of knockout mice contained abnormal neurofilamentous accumulations in neurons, suggesting defective axonal transport and/or neurodegeneration. Slice cultures prepared from knockout mice also showed a myelination defect, and reduction of Slc25a12 in rat primary oligodendrocytes led to a cell-autonomous reduction in MBP expression. Myelin deficits in slice cultures from knockout mice could be reversed by administration of pyruvate, indicating that reduction in AGC1 activity leads to reduced production of aspartate/N-acetylaspartate and/or alterations in the dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(+) ratio, resulting in myelin defects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate AGC1 activity in myelination and in neuronal structure and indicate that while loss of AGC1 leads to hypomyelination and neuronal changes, subtle alterations in AGC1 expression could affect brain development, contributing to increased autism susceptibility.",M1
20007248,"A GMCSF-neuroantigen fusion protein is a potent tolerogen in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that is associated with efficient targeting of neuroantigen to APC.Cytokine-NAg fusion proteins represent an emerging platform for specific targeting of self-antigen to particular APC subsets as a means to achieve antigen-specific immunological tolerance. This study focused on cytokine-NAg fusion proteins that targeted NAg to myeloid APC. Fusion proteins contained GM-CSF or the soluble extracellular domain of M-CSF as the N-terminal domain and the encephalitogenic 69-87 peptide of <e>MBP</e> as the C-terminal domain. GMCSF-NAg and MCSF-NAg fusion proteins were approximately 1000-fold and 32-fold more potent than NAg in stimulating antigenic proliferation of MBP-specific T cells, respectively. The potentiated antigenic responses required cytokine-NAg covalent linkage and receptor-mediated uptake. That is, the respective cytokines did not potentiate antigenic responses when cytokine and NAg were added as separate molecules, and the potentiated responses were inhibited specifically by the respective free cytokine. Cytokine-dependent targeting of NAg was specific for particular subsets of APC. GMCSF-NAg and MCSF-NAg targeted NAg to DC and macrophages; conversely, IL4-NAg and IL2-NAg fusion proteins, respectively, induced an 1000-fold enhancement in NAg reactivity in the presence of B cell and T cell APC. GMCSF-NAg significantly attenuated severity of EAE when treatment was completed before encephalitogenic challenge or alternatively, when treatment was initiated after onset of EAE. MCSF-NAg also had significant tolerogenic activity, but GMCSF-NAg was substantially more efficacious as a tolerogen. Covalent GMCSF-NAg linkage was required for prevention and treatment of EAE. In conclusion, GMCSF-NAg was highly effective for targeting NAg to myeloid APC and was a potent, antigen-specific tolerogen in EAE.",M1
20004340,"Ethanol alters the expressions of c-Fos and myelin basic protein in differentiating oligodendrocytes.Myelination occurs in the central nervous system of the human fetus, adolescents, and young adults. Ethanol interferes with myelination in part by altering the composition of the myelin sheath. Here we show that ethanol also affected the expression of the transcription factor c-Fos in differentiating oligodendrocytes (OLGs). Central glial-4 OLG progenitors were induced to differentiate in the absence and presence of 100 mM ethanol, and ethanol-caused changes in the levels of c-Fos and myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) were determined by Western blot analysis at selected developmental stages. The relatively high c-Fos level in progenitors did not immediately decrease to a low level at the onset of differentiation but displayed a downregulation at a later developmental stage. Ethanol delayed the developmental c-Fos downregulation maintaining c-Fos at a 45% higher level at 2 days of differentiation (DoD). Ethanol also decreased the rate of the burst of MBP expression that occurred between 1 and 2 DoD, reducing the MBP level by 47% at 2 DoD. The ethanol-caused delays of c-Fos downregulation and MBP upregulation were both blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM). Likewise, treatment of OLGs with a low 5-nM concentration of the PKC activator by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate mimicked the ethanol effects on the expression of both proteins, effects that were also counteracted by BIM. The results indicate that ethanol-caused delays of the stage-specific c-Fos downregulation and the inhibition of MBP expression both occur through a PKC-mediated mechanism. The ethanol-caused delay in c-Fos downregulation may disrupt normal timing for expression of genes involved in OLG differentiation, and the inhibited MBP expression may alter the myelin sheath composition.",M1
19959621,"Neurobiochemical markers of brain damage in cerebrospinal fluid of acute ischemic stroke patients.BACKGROUND: Ischemic injury to the central nervous system causes cellular activation and disintegration, leading to release of cell-type-specific proteins into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We investigated CSF concentrations of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP), the calcium-binding protein S100B, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in acute ischemic stroke patients and their relation to initial stroke severity, stroke location, and long-term stroke outcome. METHODS: CSF concentrations of MBP, GFAP, S100B, and NSE were assessed in 89 stroke patients on admission (mean 8.7 h after stroke onset) and in 35 controls. We evaluated the relation between CSF concentrations and (a) stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score on admission, infarct volume), (b) stroke location, and (c) stroke outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score at month 3). RESULTS: MBP concentration was significantly higher in subcortical than in cortical infarcts (median MBP, 1.18 vs 0.66 microg/L, P &lt; 0.001). GFAP and S100B concentrations correlated with the NIHSS score on admission (GFAP, R = 0.35, P = 0.001; S100B, R = 0.29, P = 0.006), infarct volume (GFAP, R = 0.34, P = 0.001; S100B, R = 0.28, P = 0.008), and mRS score at month 3 (R = 0.42, P &lt; 0.001 and R = 0.28, P = 0.007). Concentrations of NSE did not correlate with stroke characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: MBP, GFAP, S100B, and NSE display relevant differences in cellular and subcellular origins, which are reflected in their relation to stroke characteristics. MBP is a marker for infarct location. GFAP and S100B correlate with stroke severity and outcome.",M1
19930042,"Altered peptide ligands of myelin basic protein ( MBP87-99 ) conjugated to reduced mannan modulate immune responses in mice.Mutations of peptides to generate altered peptide ligands, capable of switching immune responses from T helper 1 (Th1) to T helper 2 (Th2), are promising candidates for the immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). We synthesized two mutant peptides from myelin basic protein 87-99 (<e>MBP</e>(87-99)), an immunodominant peptide epitope identified in MS. Mutations of residues K(91) and P(96), known to be critical T-cell receptor (TCR) contact sites, resulted in the mutant peptides [R(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99) and [A(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99). Immunization of mice with these altered peptide ligands emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant induced both interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) responses compared with only IFN-gamma responses induced to the native MBP(87-99) peptide. It was of interest that [R(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99) conjugated to reduced mannan induced 70% less IFN-gamma compared with the native MBP(87-99) peptide. However, [A(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99) conjugated to reduced mannan did not induce IFN-gamma-secreting T cells, but elicited very high levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Furthermore, antibodies generated to [A(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99) peptide conjugated to reduced mannan did not cross-react with the native MBP(87-99) peptide. By molecular modelling of the mutant peptides in complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, I-A(s), novel interactions were noted. It is clear that the double-mutant peptide analogue [A(91), A(96)]MBP(87-99) conjugated to reduced mannan is able to divert immune responses from Th1 to Th2 and is a promising mutant peptide analogue for use in studies investigating potential treatments for MS.",M1
19918882,"Visualization of myelination in GFP-transgenic zebrafish.The insulation of axons in the vertebrate nervous system by myelin is essential for efficient axonal conduction. Myelination disruption and remyelination failure can cause human diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and hereditary myelin diseases. However, despite progress in understanding myelination regulation, many important questions remain unanswered. To investigate the mechanisms underlying myelination in vivo, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the <e>mbp</e> promoter. This transgenic fish displayed faithful EGFP expression in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in embryonic and adult zebrafish. Interestingly, although myelination progressed continuously in the postembryonic central nervous system, some of the spinal cord regions were filled with unmyelinated axons even in the adult spinal cord, suggesting functional differences between myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Our results suggest that this transgenic zebrafish could be a valuable animal model to study oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vivo.",M1
19914203,"Micron-scale phase segregation in lipid monolayers induced by myelin basic protein in the presence of a cholesterol analog.It was previously shown that myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) can induce phase segregation in whole myelin monolayers and myelin lipid films, which leads to the accumulation of proteins into a separate phase, segregated from a cholesterol-enriched lipid phase. In this work we investigated some factors regulating the phase segregation induced by MBP using fluorescent microscopy of monolayers formed with binary and ternary lipid mixtures of dihydrocholesterol (a less-oxidable cholesterol analog) and phospholipids. The influence of the addition of salts to the subphase and of varying the lipid composition was analyzed. Our results show that MBP can induce a dihydrocholesterol-dependent segregation of phases that can be further regulated by the electrolyte concentration in the subphase and the composition (type and proportion) of non-sterol lipids. In this way, changes of the lipid composition of the film or the ionic strength in the aqueous media modify the local surface density of MBP and the properties (phase state and composition) of the protein environment.",M1
19886738,"Synapsin-induced proliferation of T-cell lines against myelin basic protein obtained from rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.We have previously described that antibodies and T cells against myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) rose under conditions to induce acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) bind other proteins present in the synaptosomal fraction, some of them identified as synapsin I. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether anti-MBP T-cell lines can be also activated by synapsin. The analysis of rat anti-MBP T-cell lines cultured with each antigen showed that these cells responded also to purified rat synapsin and to the amino terminal portion of this protein. This recognition originated a proliferative response with a concomitant pattern of cytokine secretion similar to that induced by MBP itself implicating that this recognition would be mediated by the T-cell receptor. On the other hand, anti-synapsin T-cell lines were not capable of responding to MBP stimulation. Therefore, the immunological cross-reactivity between both proteins occurs only in one direction and these cross-reactive cells would be elicited only in animals sensitized with MBP. A possible implication of immunological agents against MBP cross-reactive with extra-myelin proteins in the process of EAE is considered.",M1
19877432,"[Proteolytic activity of blood serum IgG in patients with systemic lupus erythematosis]Proteolytic activity of blood serum IgGs of 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) was studied in comparison with such activity in 10 clinically healthy donors. Antibodies were precipitated from blood serum by saturation with 50% (NH4)2SO4 and IgG was isolated by the affinity chromatography on protein G-sepharose column. Histone H1 and core histones from the calf thymus, bovine myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), lysozyme of chicken egg and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as substrates for proteolytic action. It was found that 4 of 10 preparations of IgGs possess an ability to hydrolyze both histone H1 and MBP. These antibodies practically did not cleave lysozyme of the chicken egg and BSA. Gel-filtration of antibodies under acidic condition and following examination of proteolytic activity of chromatographic fractions showed that histone H1 and MBP-hydrolyzing activity is attributable to IgG-antibodies. Thus, the presence of catalytically active antibodies (protabzymes) in the blood serum of patients with SLE has been demonstrated. Their origination and biological role are discussed.",M1
19831500,"Oral administration of probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve, does not exacerbate neurological symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.To evaluate the safety of two probiotic bacterial strains, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) and Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult (BbY), these probiotics were orally administered to Lewis rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the experimental model of human multiple sclerosis. We examined three experimental designs by combining different antigen types and probiotic administration periods: (1) EAE was induced with a homogenate of guinea pig spinal cord as the sensitizing antigen, and LcS was orally administered from one week before this sensitization until the end of the experiment; (2) EAE was induced using guinea pig originated myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) as the sensitizing antigen, and LcS was orally administered from one week before this sensitization to the end of the experiment; (3) EAE was induced using guinea pig MBP as the sensitizing antigen, and the probiotic strains (LcS and BbY) were administered starting in infancy (two weeks old) and continued until the end of the experiment. In experiment 1, oral administration of LcS tended to suppress the development of neurological symptoms. Differences in neurological symptoms between the control group and the administration groups did not reach statistical significance in experiments 2 and 3. These results support the notion that neither LcS nor BbY exacerbates autoimmune disease.",M1
19830840,"Divergent role for MMP-2 in myelin breakdown and oligodendrocyte death following transient global ischemia.Transient global ischemia causes delayed white matter injury to the brain with oligodendrocyte (OLG) death and myelin breakdown. There is increasing evidence that hypoxia may be involved in several diseases of the white matter, including multiple sclerosis, vascular dementia, and ischemia. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are increased in rat and mouse models of hypoxic hypoperfusion and have been associated with OLG death. However, whether the MMPs act on myelin or OLGs remains unresolved. We hypothesized that delayed expression of MMPs caused OLG death and myelin breakdown. To test the hypothesis, adult mice underwent hypoxic hypoperfusion with transient bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. After 3 days of reperfusion, ischemic white matter had increased reactivity of astrocytes and microglia, MMP-2 localization in astrocytes, and increased protein expression and activity of MMP-2. In addition, there was a significant loss of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) by Western blot and caspase-3- mediated OLG death. Treatment with the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, BB-94, significantly decreased astrocyte reactivity and MMP-2 activity. More importantly, it reduced MBP breakdown. However, MMP inhibition had no effect on OLG loss. Our results implicate MMPs released by reactive astrocytes in delayed myelin degradation, while OLG death occurs by an MMP-independent mechanism. We propose that MMP-mediated myelin loss is important in hypoxic injury to the white matter.",M1
19822525,"Regulatory and pro-inflammatory phenotypes of myelin basic protein-autoreactive T cells in multiple sclerosis.<e>MBP</e>-specific autoreactive T cells are considered pro-inflammatory T cells and thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report that MBP(83-99)-specific T cells generated from MS patients (n = 7) were comprised of pro-inflammatory and regulatory subsets of distinct phenotypes. The pro-inflammatory phenotype was characterized by high production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-17 and low expression of FOXP3, whereas the regulatory subset expressed high levels of FOXP3 and exhibited potent regulatory functions. The regulatory subset of MBP-specific T cells appeared to expand from the CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell pool. Their FOXP3 expression was stable, independent of the activation state and it correlated with suppressive function and inversely with the production of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-17. In contrast, the phenotype and function of FOXP3(low) MBP-specific T cells were adaptive and dependent on IL-6. The higher frequency of FOXP3(high) MBP-specific T cells was observed when IL-6 was neutralized in the culture of PBMC with MBP. The study provides new evidence that MBP-specific T cells are susceptible to pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu and act as either pro-inflammatory or regulatory T cells.",M1
19808102,"Mutation in the myelin proteolipid protein gene alters BK and SK channel function in the caudal medulla.Proteolipid protein (Plp) gene mutation in rodents causes severe CNS dysmyelination, early death, and lethal hypoxic ventilatory depression (Miller et al., 2004). To determine if Plp mutation alters neuronal function critical for control of breathing, the nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) of four rodent strains were studied: myelin deficient rats (MD), myelin synthesis deficient (Plp(msd)), and Plp(null) mice, as well as shiverer (<e>Mbp</e>(shi)) mice, a myelin basic protein mutant. Current-voltage relationships were analyzed using whole-cell patch-clamp in 300 microm brainstem slices. Voltage steps were applied, and inward and outward currents quantified. MD, Plp(msd), and Plp(null), but not Mbp(shi) neurons exhibited reduced outward current in nTS at P21. Apamin blockade of SK calcium-dependent currents and iberiotoxin blockade of BK calcium-dependent currents in the P21 MD rat demonstrated reduced outward current due to dysfunction of these channels. These results provide evidence that Plp mutation specifically alters neuronal excitability through calcium-dependent potassium channels in nTS.",M1
19794071,"Costimulatory pathways in multiple sclerosis: distinctive expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in patients with different patterns of disease.T lymphocytes costimulatory molecules, including CD80, CD86, CD28, CTLA4, PD-1, PD-L1, and B7-H3, are associated with the preferential production of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. We analyzed the expression of these molecules and myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-specific IL-10 and IFN-gamma production in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with relapsing-remitting acute (AMS, n = 40) or stable (SMS, n = 38). Twenty-two patients successfully undergoing therapy with glatimer acetate (n = 12) or IFNbeta (n = 10) were also analyzed. MBP-specific and PD-1-expressing T lymphocytes, PD-L1-expressing CD19(+) cells, and PD-L1(+)/IL-10(+)/CD14(+) and CD19(+) cells were significantly augmented in SMS patients. Additionally, MBP-specific and annexin V-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) (apoptotic) T lymphocytes were augmented and pAkt-positive (proliferating) cells were decreased in SMS compared with AMS patients. PD-1 ligation resulted in the increase of pAkt(+) lymphocytes in AMS patients alone. B7-H3 expression and IFN-gamma production were comparable in all individuals but the PD-L1(+)/IL-10(+) over B7-H3(+)/IFN-gamma(+) ratio was significantly lower in AMS compared with SMS patients. Finally, PD-L1 expression on immune cells was reduced in treated patients, suggesting that therapy-induced disease remission is not associated with the modulation of the expression of this molecule. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays an important role in modulating immune functions in MS patients; monitoring and targeting these proteins could offer diagnostic and therapeutic advantages.",M1
19787061,"Convergence of cells from the progenitor fraction of adult olfactory bulb tissue to remyelinating glia in demyelinating spinal cord lesions.BACKGROUND: Progenitor cells isolated from adult brain tissue are important tools for experimental studies of remyelination. Cells harvested from neurogenic regions in the adult brain such as the subependymal zone have demonstrated remyelination potential. Multipotent cells from the progenitor fraction have been isolated from the adult olfactory bulb (OB) but their potential to remyelinate has not been studied. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used the buoyant density gradient centrifugation method to isolate the progenitor fraction and harvest self-renewing multipotent neural cells grown in monolayers from the adult green-fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic rat OB. OB tissue was mechanically and chemically dissociated and the resultant cell suspension fractionated on a Percoll gradient. The progenitor fraction was isolated and these cells were plated in growth media with serum for 24 hrs. Cells were then propagated in N2 supplemented serum-free media containing b-FGF. Cells at passage 4 (P4) were introduced into a demyelinated spinal cord lesion. The GFP(+) cells survived and integrated into the lesion, and extensive remyelination was observed in plastic sections. Immunohistochemistry revealed GFP(+) cells in the spinal cord to be glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuronal nuclei (NeuN), and neurofilament negative. The GFP(+) cells were found among primarily P0(+) myelin profiles, although some myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) profiles were present. Immuno-electron microscopy for GFP revealed GFP(+) cell bodies adjacent to and surrounding peripheral-type myelin rings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We report that neural cells from the progenitor fraction of the adult rat OB grown in monolayers can be expanded for several passages in culture and that upon transplantation into a demyelinated spinal cord lesion provide extensive remyelination without ectopic neuronal differentiation.",M1
19747901,"Association between myelin basic protein expression and left entorhinal cortex pre-alpha cell layer disorganization in schizophrenia.There is evidence for migrational disturbances in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in schizophrenia that supports a neurodevelopmental origin of the disorder. Since impaired myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) gene expression during the migration phase could lead to abnormalities in final laminar position, we performed layer specific measurements of MBP expression in the ERC and hypothesised that migrational disturbances of pre-alpha-cell clusters relate to decreased MBP expression. Paraffin embedded sections of the left entorhinal cortex of 16 schizophrenia patients and 10 control subjects were stained for MBP using routine immunohistochemistry. On each section representative regions of interest were scanned to attain optimal quality images of the gray matter. Results were correlated to previous published disturbed dispersion of pre-alpha-cell clusters in adjacent brain sections. Mean MBP stain-intensity was significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients. Absolute MBP stain-intensity was significantly reduced in layers III and IV in patients. A significant correlation of MBP stain-intensity with the distance of the deep pole of the pre-alpha-cell cluster from the gray-white matter junction was observed in the ERC of schizophrenia patients. The present data provide evidence for reduced MBP expression in the ERC in schizophrenia, which implies deficits in axonal myelination and disturbed connectivity. MBP gene is expressed in oligodendrocytes and neuronal populations during embryonic development, which are important in establishing the structure of the cerebral cortex. Correlation between reduced MBP as a sign of down-regulated MBP gene expression and disorganization of pre-alpha-cell clusters supports a neurodevelopmental origin of pathological processes in schizophrenia.",M1
19747899,"Long-term cognitive impairment and myelination deficiency in a rat model of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.Although periventricular white matter injury is a leading cause of major neurologic disability in premature infants, the relationship between myelination deficiency and long-term cognitive dysfunction is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate oligodendrocytes myelination and long-term spatial cognitive function in rats with perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Postnatal day 3 (P3) rats were subjected to right carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia (6% oxygen). Brain injury during the early and late phases was evaluated by immunostaining at P6 (72 h after the injury) and P47. Spatial cognitive function was evaluated at P42 using the Morris Water Maze test followed by histologic evaluation. HI caused an increase in pre-oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia in the ipsilateral white matter 72 h after the insult compared to contralateral regions and sham-operated controls (both p&lt;0.05). There were significant decreases in myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-labeled oligodendrocytes with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-labeled glial scarring in the ipsilateral periventricular white matter at P47 compared to contralateral regions and sham-operated controls (all p&lt;0.05). The rats with HI had spatial learning deficits in navigation trials (longer escape latency and swimming distance) and memory dysfunction in probe trials (fewer number of platform crossings and percentage of time in the target quadrant) compared with sham-operated controls (p&lt;0.05). In this neonatal rat model of HI, myelination deficiency induced by activated astrocytes and microglia during the early phase with subsequent glial scarring was associated with long-term spatial learning and memory dysfunction.",M1
19726693,"Inflammatory proprotein convertase-matrix metalloproteinase proteolytic pathway in antigen-presenting cells as a step to autoimmune multiple sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system with autoimmune etiology. Susceptibility to MS is linked to viral and bacterial infections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) and demyelination. The splice variants of the single MBP gene are expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system (classic MBP) and in the immune cells (Golli-MBPs). Our data suggest that persistent inflammation caused by environmental risk factors is a step to MS. We have discovered biochemical evidence suggesting the presence of the inflammatory proteolytic pathway leading to MS. The pathway involves the self-activated furin and PC2 proprotein convertases and membrane type-6 MMP (MT6-MMP/MMP-25) that is activated by furin/PC2. These events are followed by MMP-25 proteolysis of the Golli-MBP isoforms in the immune system cells and stimulation of the specific autoimmune T cell clones. It is likely that the passage of these autoimmune T cell clones through the disrupted blood-brain barrier to the brain and the recognition of neuronal, classic MBP causes inflammation leading to the further up-regulation of the activity of the multiple individual MMPs, the massive cleavage of MBP in the brain, demyelination, and MS. In addition to the cleavage of Golli-MBPs, MMP-25 proteolysis readily inactivates crystallin alphaB that is a suppressor of MS. These data suggest that MMP-25 plays an important role in MS pathology and that MMP-25, especially because of its restricted cell/tissue expression pattern and cell surface/lipid raft localization, is a promising drug target in MS.",M1
19696693,"Protective effect of resveratrol in severe acute pancreatitis-induced brain injury.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to study the effects of resveratrol on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)-induced brain injury. METHODS: Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: sham operation, SAP, resveratrol-treated (RES), and dexamethasone-treated. Each group was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 hours. Levels of serum myelin basic protein and zonula occludens 1 (Zo-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The brain and pancreatic tissues were examined using electron microscopy. Expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 were observed using immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. Cytochrome c was detected using Western blotting alone. RESULTS: Myelin basic protein and Zo-1 levels of the RES group were lower than the SAP group at all time points (P &lt; 0.05). The RES group had significantly improved pathologic brain, increase in Bcl-2 expression, and decrease in Bax and caspases-3 expressions compared with the SAP group. CONCLUSIONS: The degradation of Zo-1 is involved in the pathophysiology of brain injury in SAP; <e>MBP</e> can be used as a marker of brain injury in SAP. The protective effect of resveratrol might be associated with the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax and caspase-3.",M1
19692707,"Degradation of amyloid beta protein by purified myelin basic protein.The progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in senile plaques and in the cerebral vasculature is the hallmark of Alzheimer disease and related disorders. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain likely contributes to the prevalent sporadic form of Alzheimer disease. Several major pathways for Abeta clearance include receptor-mediated cellular uptake, blood-brain barrier transport, and direct proteolytic degradation. Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) is the major structural protein component of myelin and plays a functional role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath. MBP possesses endogenous serine proteinase activity and can undergo autocatalytic cleavage liberating distinct fragments. Recently, we showed that MBP binds Abeta and inhibits Abeta fibril formation (Hoos, M. D., Ahmed, M., Smith, S. O., and Van Nostrand, W. E. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9952-9961; Hoos, M. D., Ahmed, M., Smith, S. O., and Van Nostrand, W. E. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 4720-4727). Here we show that Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides are degraded by purified human brain MBP and recombinant human MBP, but not an MBP fragment that lacks autolytic activity. MBP-mediated Abeta degradation is inhibited by serine proteinase inhibitors. Similarly, Cos-1 cells expressing MBP degrade exogenous Abeta40 and Abeta42. In addition, we demonstrate that purified MBP also degrades assembled fibrillar Abeta in vitro. Mass spectrometry analysis identified distinct degradation products generated from Abeta digestion by MBP. Lastly, we demonstrate in situ that purified MBP can degrade parenchymal amyloid plaques as well as cerebral vascular amyloid that form in brain tissue of Abeta precursor protein transgenic mice. Together, these findings indicate that purified MBP possesses Abeta degrading activity in vitro.",M1

IFNgamma-producing cells could be sub-divided into those that are T-bet(+)/RORgammat(-) and those that are T-bet(+)/RORgammat(+). The latter comprises a spectrum of phenotypes, as defined by IL-17 production, and can be induced to up-regulate IL-23R with IL-12 or IL-23. The former, bona fide Th1 cells, lack IL-23R expression under all conditions. In vivo, T-bet(+)/RORgammat(-) and T-bet(+)/RORgammat(+) clones induce EAE equally well.",M1
19689739,"T-cell seeding: neonatal transfer of anti-myelin basic protein T-cell lines renders Fischer rats susceptible later in life to the active induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitis.Fischer strain rats resist active induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) following immunization with guinea-pig myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Nevertheless, we now report that an encephalitogenic CD4(+) anti-MBP T-cell line could be developed from actively immunized Fischer rats. Adoptive transfer of the activated line mediated acute EAE in adult Fischer rats, but not in 1-day-old rats. Moreover, we found that both resting and activated anti-MBP T cells injected 1 day post-natally rendered these rats susceptible later in life to the active induction of EAE by immunization with MBP/CFA. The actively induced EAE manifested the accelerated onset of a secondary, memory-type response. Resting anti-MBP T cells injected even up to 2 weeks post-natally produced no clinical signs but seeded 50-100% of the recipients for an active encephalitogenic immune response to MBP. An earlier T-cell injection (1-2 days) produced a higher incidence and stronger response. The transferred resting T cells entered the neonatal spleen and thymus and proliferated there but did not change the total anti-MBP precursor number in adults. Splenocytes harvested from rats that were injected neonatally but not exposed to MBP in vivo proliferated strongly and produced significant amounts of interferon-gamma to MBP in vitro. Similar results were observed in rats injected with resting T-cell lines reactive to ovalbumin, suggesting that the neonatal injection of resting T cells specific for a self or for a foreign antigen can seed the immune system with the potential for an enhanced effector response to that antigen later in life.",M1
19683076,"The myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP) as a relevant primary target autoantigen in multiple sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the human CNS, characterized by perivascular inflammation, demyelination and axonal damage. Although the etiology of MS is unknown, it is believed that the disease results from destructive autoimmune mechanisms, presumably initiated by abnormal activation of potentially pathogenic autoimmune T-cells recognizing CNS components. The myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (MOBP), a relatively abundant CNS-specific myelin protein, which plays a role in stabilizing the myelin sheath in the CNS, has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Here we review studies showing that MOBP is as an important candidate target antigen in MS as the other widely studied target antigens, myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The studies summarized below indicate that T-cell autoimmunity against MOBP can be detected in MS patients; T-cells reactive against MOBP can be pathogenic in several mouse strains as well as in the  humanized  HLA-DR15-Tg mice; and, that the HLA-DQ6-restricted, but not HLA-DR15-restricted, MOBP-reactive T-cells cause in HLA-DR15-Tg mice MS-like clinical disease associated with perivascular and parenchymal infiltration, demyelination, axonal loss, and optic neuritis. Accordingly, the MOBP should be considered a bona fide primary target antigen in MS, in addition to MBP, PLP, and MOG.",M1
19664668,"Neuropeptide changes and neuroactive amino acids in CSF from humans and sheep with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease).Anomalies in neuropeptides and neuroactive amino acids have been postulated to play a role in neurodegeneration in a variety of diseases including the inherited neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease). These are often indicated by concentration changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we compare CSF neuropeptide concentrations in patients with the classical juvenile CLN3 form of NCL and the classical late infantile CLN2 form with neuropeptide and neuroactive amino acid concentrations in CSF from sheep with the late infantile variant CLN6 form. A marked disease related increase in CSF concentrations of neuron specific enolase and tau protein was noted in the juvenile CLN3 patients but this was not observed in an advanced CLN2 patient nor CLN6 affected sheep. No changes were noted in S-100b, GFAP or <e>MBP</e> in patients or of S-100b, GFAP or IGF-1 in affected sheep. There were no disease related changes in CSF concentrations of the neuroactive amino acids, aspartate, glutamate, serine, glutamine, glycine, taurine and GABA in these sheep. The changes observed in the CLN3 patients may be progressive markers of neurodegeneration, or of underlying metabolic changes perhaps associated with CLN3 specific changes in neuroactive amino acids, as have been postulated. The lack of changes in the CLN2 and CLN6 subjects indicate that these changes are not shared by the CLN2 or CLN6 forms and changes in CSF concentrations of these compounds are unreliable as biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the NCLs in general.",M1
19663312,"[Expression of myelin basic protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein genes in human glial brain tumors]Analysis of the expression of genes encoding myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) genes in human glial tumors was carried out for determination of the expression specificity of these genes according to tumor types and their malignancy. Low levels of MBP mRNA in astrocytoma specimens of malignancy grades II-IV and significantly higher levels in perifocal zone adjacent to them have been determined by Northern hybridization. Diffuse astrocytomas and anaplastic astrocytomas are characterized mostly by low level of MBP gene expression and high level of GFAP gene expression, but distinct subtypes of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas with high level of MBP gene and low level of GFAP gene expression can be also detected that may be the reflection of different oncogenic pathways. Very low levels or even absence of MBP mRNA were revealed in oligodendroglioma and all oligoastrocytomas. Thus, Northern hybridization data are correlated with Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE). Obtained results show that MBP is nonspecific marker for tumors of oligodendroglial origin, but determination of relative levels of MBP and GFAP mRNAs may be useful for glial tumors recognition. By such a way, these two genes together with previously found by us YKL-40 and TSC-22 can be included into the gene panel for the determination of so called  gene signatures  of brain tumors. However, severe requirements in relation to a clinical value of these  gene signatures  can not be formulated without their verification on plenty of clinical samples of tumors and valid control.",M1

Fucoidan (50 mg/kg, daily) was administered to rats with EAE intraperitoneally, either in the EAE induction phase from either 1 day before immunization to day 7 post-immunization (PI), or the effector phase from day 8 to 14 PI, to test which phase of rat EAE is affected by fucoidan treatment.The onset, severity and duration of EAE paralysis in the fucoidan-treated group in the days 8-14 PI-treated rats, but not in days -1-7 PI-treated rats, were significantly delayed, suppressed and reduced, respectively, compared with the vehicle-treated controls. Treatment with fucoidan reduced the encephalitogenic response and TNF-alpha production during EAE. Moreover, the clinical amelioration coincided with decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the EAE-affected spinal cord. The ameliorative effect of fucoidan on clinical paralysis in EAE-affected rats may be mediated, in part, by the suppression of the autoreactive T cell response and inflammatory cytokine production.",M1
19649992,"BHT-3009, a myelin basic protein-encoding plasmid for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.Even though the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains largely unknown, research data support the hypothesis that autoimmunity plays a major role in disease development. Several disease-modifying agents have been approved for the treatment of MS; however, there is still a need for antigen-specific treatments that combine efficacy and safety. DNA vaccination represents a new therapeutic alternative in this respect. Preclinical studies in different models of autoimmunity have demonstrated that injection of plasmid DNA encoding a self-antigen in mice restores self-tolerance, leaving immunity against infectious and tumor antigens intact. Based on this evidence, the first DNA vaccine for MS has been created. Bayhill Therapeutic Inc's BHT-3009 encodes full-length, human myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), and has recently been evaluated in a phase I/II and a phase II clinical trial. BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated in both trials, inducing immune tolerance that extended beyond MBP to other myelin antigens. In addition, a reduction in the number of active lesions was observed, which was accompanied by a decrease in clinical relapse rates, particularly in patients with high immunological activity at baseline. BHT-3009 appears to be a promising new approach for the treatment of MS, although further clinical trials are warranted to confirm the early findings.",M1
19648787,"No role for cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein levels in patients treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.INTRODUCTION: Central nervous system prophylaxis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has dropped rates of relapses but has been associated with neurotoxicity and imaging abnormalities. Predictors of neurotoxicity are lacking, because of inconsistency between clinical symptoms and imaging. Some have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) levels to be of potential interest. A retrospective analysis of MBP levels in correlation with clinical and radiologic data is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MBP levels obtained at the time of intrathecals, charts, and neuroradiology reports were retrospectively analyzed. Academic achievement data were obtained from phone contacts with patients and families. RESULTS: We retrieved 1248 dosages of MBP in 83 patients, 381 neurologic examinations in 34 patients and 69 neuroradiologic investigations in 27 patients. Fifty-two patients had abnormal MBP levels. Radiologic anomalies were present in 47% of those investigated, 14% of them having school difficulties. Proportions of patients with school difficulties in the groups with abnormal MBP levels but no radiologic anomalies or with no radiologic investigations were 0% and 3%, respectively, which was lower than in the group of patients with normal MBP levels (100%, 22%, and 5%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Notwithstanding the retrospective character of our study, we conclude that there is limited usefulness of systematic dosage of MBP as indicator of treatment-induced neurotoxicity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.",M1
19642704,"Structural polymorphism and multifunctionality of myelin basic protein.Central nervous system myelin is a dynamic entity arising from membrane processes extended from oligodendrocytes, which form a tightly wrapped multilamellar structure around neurons enabling rapid and efficient signal propagation. The gene of oligodendrocyte lineage (golli) gives rise to a variety of developmentally regulated splice isoforms of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), denoted golli for early forms and classic for later ones. In mature myelin, the predominant splice isoform of classic MBP is 18.5 kDa; its central role is to maintain the structural integrity of the myelin sheath, by holding together the apposing cytoplasmic leaflets of the oligodendrocyte membrane in a tight, spiral, multilamellar arrangement. This protein's extreme physicochemical properties, net charge of +19 at neutral pH, low proportion of hydrophobic residues, alternating regions of predicted intrinsic disorder and order, induced folding upon association with membranes and other proteins, and diversification via combinatorial post-translational modifications, define not only its role as a molecular Velcro in compact myelin, but as a multifunctional hub that may also bind to a number of other proteins and small molecule ligands in myelinating oligodendrocytes. In particular, MBP may link the underlying cytoskeleton and proteins containing SH3 domains to the membrane, allowing it to transduce transmembrane signals to the cytosol. These associations are facilitated by MBP being an intrinsically disordered protein, creating a large effective protein surface, and by the formation of transient and/or induced ordered secondary structure elements for molecular recognition. These processes can be modulated by a molecular barcode of numerous post-translational modifications and interactions with proteins such as calmodulin. In the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, an aberrant pattern of modifications may contribute to demyelination and confound inherent attempts at repair. The conformational dynamics of the various isoforms and modified variants of MBP and their interactions with other proteins potentially allow them to participate in events coupling extracellular signals to cytoskeletal organization during myelination or remyelination. Various biophysical and cell biological approaches are beginning to elucidate these properties of MBP and are leading to a new understanding of the role of this protein as a linker and/or hub in structural and signaling networks in oligodendrocytes and myelin.",M1
19630914,"Antibodies against a class II HLA-peptide complex raised by active immunization of mice with antigen mimicking peptides.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease linked to the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101 and DQB1*0602. T cells reactive towards the DRB1*1501 in complex with various peptides derived from myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), which is the major component of myelin, have been found in the peripheral blood of MS patients. These autoreactive T cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. In this article, antibodies against the HLA complex DR2b (DRA1*0101/DRB1*1501) in complex with the MBP-derived peptide MBP(85-99) have been generated by immunization of NMRI mice with three different antigen mimicking peptides displayed on M13 bacteriophages. The peptides mimick the epitope of a monoclonal antibody specific for the DR2b-MBP(85-99) complex. The mice developed IgG antibodies not only against the peptides injected, but they also developed antibodies against the DR2b complex and specific antibodies against the DR2b-MBP(85-99) complex. These data open up the possibility of designing antigen mimicking peptides for vaccination against MS.",M1
19627443,"Inhibition of calpain attenuates encephalitogenicity of <e>MBP</e>-specific T cells.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease of the CNS, possessing both immune and neurodegenerative events that lead to disability. Adoptive transfer (AT) of myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells into naïve female SJL/J mice results in a relapsing-remitting (RR) form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Blocking the mechanisms by which MBP-specific T cells are activated before AT may help characterize the immune arm of MS and offer novel targets for therapy. One such target is calpain, which is involved in activation of T cells, migration of immune cells into the CNS, degradation of axonal and myelin proteins, and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, the hypothesis that inhibiting calpain in MBP-specific T cells would diminish their encephalitogenicity in RR-EAE mice was tested. Incubating MBP-specific T cells with the calpain inhibitor SJA6017 before AT markedly suppressed the ability of these T cells to induce clinical symptoms of RR-EAE. These reductions correlated with decreases in demyelination, inflammation, axonal damage, and loss of oligodendrocytes and neurons. Also, calpain : calpastatin ratio, production of truncated Bid, and Bax : Bcl-2 ratio, and activities of calpain and caspases, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation were attenuated. Thus, these data suggest calpain as a promising target for treating EAE and MS.",M1
19610113,"Down-regulation of microglia and NG2-positive cells reaction in trimethyltin-injured hippocampus of rats treated with myelin basic protein-reactive T cells: possible contribution to the neuroprotective effect of T cells.In our previous investigations, we demonstrated that CD4(+) antimyelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) T cells protect hippocampal neurons against trimethyltin-induced damage. We hypothesized involvement of T cells, interacting with the various glial populations activated during the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we employ immunocytochemical methods to investigate the influence of administration of T cells on the response of microglia and of NG2(+) cells to trimethyltin (TMT)-induced damage. Female Lewis rats were treated with anti-MBP CD4(+) T cells (4 million per animal, i.v) 24 hr after TMT (8 mg/kg, i.p) intoxication. TMT caused degeneration of CA4 hipppocampal neurons and evoked an abundant reaction of microglial and NG2(+) cells in the injured region. The cells changed morphology into the activated state, and the number of OX42(+) and NG2(+) cells increased about 4.5-fold and 3-fold, respectively, relative to controls as assessed on day 21 after TMT treatment. Additionally, the cells of ameboid morphology, which expressed NG2 or microglial antigens, appeared in the zone of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, certain cells of ameboid phenotype shared both antigens. In rats treated with T cells, down-regulation of the activation of both glial classes and reduction of formation of their ameboid forms was observed. The number of the total OX42(+) and NG2(+) cells decreased by 21% and 54%, respectively, and the number of their ameboid forms decreased by 46% and 73%, respectively. Our data suggest that the diminished activation of microglia and NG2(+) cells, particularly the reduced number of their ameboid forms, may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of T cells.",M1
19598242,"Leukemia inhibitory factor regulates the timing of oligodendrocyte development and myelination in the postnatal optic nerve.Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes the survival of oligodendrocytes both in vitro and in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, but the possible role of LIF signaling in myelination during normal development has not been investigated. We find that LIF(-/-) mice have a pronounced myelination defect in optic nerve at postnatal day 10. Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)- and proteolipid protein (PLP)-positive myelin was evident throughout the optic nerve in the wild-type mice, but staining was present only at the chiasmal region in LIF(-/-) mice of the same age. Further experiments suggest that the myelination defect was a consequence of a delay in maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) population. The number of Olig2-positive cells was dramatically decreased in optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice, and the distribution of Olig2-positive cells was restricted to the chiasmal region of the nerve in a steep gradient toward the retina. Gene expression profiling and cell culture experiments revealed that OPCs from P10 optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice remained in a highly proliferative immature stage compared with littermate controls. Interestingly, by postnatal day 14, MBP immunostaining in the LIF(-/-) optic nerve was comparable to that of LIF(+/+) mice. These results suggest that, during normal development of mouse optic nerve, there is a defined developmental time window when LIF is required for correct myelination. Myelination seems to recover by postnatal day 14, so LIF is not necessary for the completion of myelination during postnatal development.",M1
19559391,"Sodium channel expression and localization at demyelinated sites in painful human dental pulp.The expression of sodium channels (NaCh(s)) change after inflammatory and nerve lesions, and this change has been implicated in the generation of pain states. Here we examine NaCh expression within nerve fibers from normal and painful extracted human teeth with special emphasis on their localization within large accumulations, like those seen at nodes of Ranvier. Pulpal tissue sections from normal wisdom teeth and from teeth with large carious lesions associated with severe and spontaneous pain were double-stained with pan-specific NaCh antibody and caspr (paranodal protein used to visualize nodes of Ranvier) antibody, while additional sections were triple-stained with NaCh, caspr and myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) antibodies. Z-series of images were obtained with the confocal microscope and evaluated with NIH ImageJ software to quantify the density and size of NaCh accumulations, and to characterize NaCh localization at caspr-identified typical and atypical nodal sites. Although the results showed variability in the overall density and size of NaCh accumulations in painful samples, a common finding included the remodeling of NaChs at atypical nodal sites. This remodeling of NaChs included prominent NaCh expression within nerve regions that showed a selective loss of MBP staining in a pattern consistent with a demyelinating process. PERSPECTIVE: This study identifies the remodeling of NaChs at demyelinated sites within the painful human dental pulp and suggests that the contribution of NaChs to spontaneous pulpal pain generation may be dependant not only on total NaCh density but may also be related to NaCh expression at atypical nodal sites.",M1
19539560,"Amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by curcumin treatment through inhibition of IL-17 production.Experimental autoimmune encephalomylitis (EAE), an animal mode of multiple sclerosis (MS), was previously considered that be mediated by Th1 cells. However, a number of recent studies provided strong evidence that T helper cells that produce IL-17 play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of EAE. Curcumin (1,7-Bis 94-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6 heptadiene-3, 5-di-one) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic phytochemical isolated from the rhizome of the medicinal plant Curcuma longa. It has been strongly implicated as an anti-inflammatory agent, but the precise mechanisms of its action are largely unknown. In the present study, we have investigated the efficacy and mechanism of curcumin against EAE. The treatment of Lewis rats with curcumin significantly reduced the clinical severity of EAE, and had a dramatic reduction in the number of inflammatory cells infiltration in the spinal cord. The proliferation of the <e>MBP</e>-reaction lymphocyte also was reduced in a curcumin dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of the cytokine profiles was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), revealing the dramatic decrease of IL-17, TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-21, STAT3, and RORgammat expression in curcumin-treated groups and STAT3-phosphorylation also was inhibited. These findings indicated that curcumin amelioration EAE was, to a large extent, due to inhibit differentiation and development of Th17 cells depends on down-regulating expression of IL-6, IL-21, RORgammat signaling and inhibition STAT3-phosphorylation, suggests it is useful in the treatment of MS and other Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases.",M1
19538632,"Myelin basic protein-positive nerve fibres in human Meissner corpuscles.Myelinated nerve fibres forming sensory corpuscles become amyelinic before entering the corpuscle. Interestingly, in Meissner corpuscles from monkey myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), a specific component of myelin sheath co-localized with neuronal markers. To investigate whether or not this also occurs in human digital Meissner corpuscles, we used single and double immunohistochemistry to detect MBP associated with axonic (protein gene product (PGP) 9.5) or Schwann and Schwann-related cell (S100 protein) markers. We also studied these markers in Pacinian corpuscles. Nerve fibres immunoreactive for MBP were detected in about 25% of the Meissner corpuscles examined; however, MBP never co-localized with PGP 9.5 and MBP occasionally co-localized with S100 protein. MBP-immunoreactive fibres associated with Meissner corpuscles were observed at the periphery of the lamellar cells or within the corpuscle between the lamellar cells. These results describe the distribution of myelinated nerve fibres expressing MBP in human Meissner corpuscles, which is important when studying Meissner corpuscles in cutaneous biopsies used for the diagnosis of peripheral and degenerative neuropathies.",M1
19519451,"The classic basic protein of myelin--conserved structural motifs and the dynamic molecular barcode involved in membrane adhesion and protein-protein interactions.The myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) family comprises a variety of developmentally-regulated members arising from different transcription start sites, differential splicing, and post-translational modifications. The  classic  isoforms of MBP include the 18.5 kDa form, which predominates in adult human myelin and facilitates compaction of the mature myelin sheath in the central nervous system, thereby maintaining its structural integrity. In addition to membrane-association, the 18.5 kDa and all other classic isoforms are able to interact with a multitude of proteins, including Ca(2+)-calmodulin, actin, tubulin, and SH3-domain containing proteins, and thus may be signalling linkers during myelin development and remodelling. All proteins in this family are intrinsically disordered, creating a large effective surface to facilitate multiple protein associations, and are post-translationally modified to various degrees by methylation, phosphorylation, and deimination. We have used spectroscopic (fluorescence, CD, EPR, and NMR) approaches to study MBP's conformational adaptability. A highly-conserved central domain presents an amphipathic alpha-helix in association with a phospholipid membrane, and contains a threonyl residue that is phosphorylated by MAP-kinases. In multiple sclerosis, this segment represents a primary immunodominant epitope. This helical structure is adjacent to a proline-rich region that presents a classic SH3-ligand, comprises a second MAP-kinase phosphorylation site, and forms a polyproline type II helix. This domain of the protein is thus essential to proper positioning of a protein-interaction motif, with the local conformation and accessibility being modulated by MAP-kinases. In addition, the C-terminus of 18.5 kDa MBP has been identified by NMR spectroscopy as a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-binding site, and is of note for having a high density of post-translational modifications (protein kinase C phosphorylation, and deimination). For the most part, any classic protein isoform functions as an entropic spring that interacts in its entirety with membranes and cytoskeletal proteins, but the central and C-terminal motifs may represent molecular switches.",M1
19517016,"The QKI-6 and QKI-7 RNA binding proteins block proliferation and promote Schwann cell myelination.BACKGROUND: The quaking viable (qk(v)) mice have uncompacted myelin in their central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS). The qk gene encodes 3 major alternatively spliced isoforms that contain unique sequence at their C-terminus dictating their cellular localization. QKI-5 is a nuclear isoform, whereas QKI-6 and QKI-7 are cytoplasmic isoforms. The qk(v) mice harbor an enhancer/promoter deletion that prevents the expression of isoforms QKI-6 and QKI-7 in myelinating cells resulting in a dysmyelination phenotype. It was shown that QKI regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, however, little is known about the role of the QKI proteins, or RNA binding proteins in PNS myelination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To define the role of the QKI proteins in PNS myelination, we ectopically expressed QKI-6 and QKI-7 in primary rat Schwann cell/neuron from dorsal root ganglia cocultures. We show that the QKI isoforms blocked proliferation and promoted Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. In addition, these events were coordinated with elevated proteins levels of p27(KIP1) and myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), markers of Schwann cell differentiation. QKI-6 and QKI-7 expressing co-cultures contained myelinated fibers that had directionality and contained significantly thicker myelin, as assessed by electron microscopy. Moreover, QKI-deficient Schwann cells had reduced levels of MBP, p27(KIP1) and Krox-20 mRNAs, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the QKI-6 and QKI-7 RNA binding proteins are positive regulators of PNS myelination and show that the QKI RNA binding proteins play a key role in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination.",M1
19503091,"Kif1b is essential for mRNA localization in oligodendrocytes and development of myelinated axons.The kinesin motor protein Kif1b has previously been implicated in the axonal transport of mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. More recently, KIF1B has been associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that Kif1b is required for the localization of <e>mbp</e> (myelin basic protein) mRNA to processes of myelinating oligodendrocytes in zebrafish. We observe the ectopic appearance of myelin-like membrane in kif1b mutants, coincident with the ectopic localization of myelin proteins in kif1b mutant oligodendrocyte cell bodies. These observations suggest that oligodendrocytes localize certain mRNA molecules, namely those encoding small basic proteins such as MBP, to prevent aberrant effects of these proteins elsewhere in the cell. We also find that Kif1b is required for outgrowth of some of the longest axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Our data demonstrate previously unknown functions of kif1b in vivo and provide insights into its possible roles in MS.",M1
19487109,"Abnormal expression of myelination genes and alterations in white matter fractional anisotropy following prenatal viral influenza infection at E16 in mice.Prenatal viral infection has been associated with the development of schizophrenia and autism. Our laboratory has previously shown that viral infection causes deleterious effects on brain structure and function in mouse offspring following late first trimester (E9) and late second trimester (E18) administration of influenza virus. We hypothesized that middle second trimester infection (E16) in mice may lead to a different pattern of brain gene expression and structural defects in the developing offspring. C57BL6 mice were infected on E16 with a sublethal dose of human influenza virus or sham-infected using vehicle solution. Male offspring of the infected mice were collected at P0, P14, P35, and P56, their brains removed and cerebella dissected and flash frozen. Microarray, DTI and MRI scanning, as well as qRT-PCR and SDS-PAGE and western blotting analyses were performed to detect differences in gene expression and brain atrophy. Expression of several genes associated with myelination, including <e>Mbp</e>, Mag, and Plp1 were found to be altered, as were protein levels of Mbp, Mag, and DM20. Brain imaging revealed significant atrophy in cerebellum at P14, reduced fractional anisotropy in white matter of the right internal capsule at P0, and increased fractional anisotropy in white matter in corpus callosum at P14 and right middle cerebellar peduncle at P56. We propose that maternal infection in mouse impacts myelination genes.",M1
19473529,"Intravitreal NGF administration counteracts retina degeneration after permanent carotid artery occlusion in rat.BACKGROUND: The neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) is produced by different cell types in the anterior and posterior eye, exerting a neuroprotective role in the adult life. The visual system is highly sensitive to NGF and the retina and optic nerve provides suitable subjects for the study of central nervous system degeneration. The model of bilateral carotid occlusion (two-vessel occlusion, 2VO) is a well-established model for chronic brain hypoperfusion leading to brain capillary pathology, to retina and optic nerve degeneration. In order to study if a single intravitreal injection of NGF protects the retina and the optic nerve from degeneration during systemic circulatory diseases, we investigated morphological and molecular changes occurring in the retina and optic nerve of adult rats at different time-points (8, 30 and 75 days) after bilateral carotid occlusion. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of NGF (5 microg/3 microl performed 24 hours after 2VO ligation) has a long-lasting protective effect on retina and optic nerve degeneration. NGF counteracts retinal ganglion cells degeneration by early affecting Bax/Bcl-2 balance- and c-jun- expression (at 8 days after 2VO). A single intravitreal NGF injection regulates the demyelination/remyelination balance after ischemic injury in the optic nerve toward remyelination (at 75 days after 2VO), as indicated by the <e>MBP</e> expression regulation, thus preventing optic nerve atrophy and ganglion cells degeneration. At 8 days, NGF does not modify 2VO-induced alteration in VEFG and related receptors mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of exogenous NGF during this systemic circulatory disease seems to occur also by strengthening the effect of endogenous NGF, the synthesis of which is increased by vascular defect and also by the mechanical lesion associated with NGF or even vehicle intraocular delivery.",M1
19468823,"NMR structural elucidation of myelin basic protein epitope 83-99 implicated in multiple sclerosis.Myelin basic protein peptide 83-99 (MBP83-99) is the most immunodominant epitope playing a significant role in the multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Many peptide analogues, linear or cyclic have been designed and synthesized based on this segment in order to inhibit the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the best well-known animal model of MS. In this study, the solution structural motif of <e>MBP</e>(83-99) has been performed using 2D (1)H-NMR spectroscopy in dimethyl sulfoxide. A rather extended conformation, along with the formation of a well defined alpha-helix spanning residues Val(87)-Phe(90) is proposed, as no long-range NOE are presented. Moreover, the residues of MBP peptide that are important for T-cell receptor recognition are solvent exposed. The spatial arrangement of the side chain all over the sequence of our NMR based model exhibits great similarity with the solid state model, while both TCR contacts occupy the same region in space.",M1
19459213,"Tenascin C and tenascin R similarly prevent the formation of myelin membranes in a RhoA-dependent manner, but antagonistically regulate the expression of myelin basic protein via a separate pathway.Membrane formation and the initiation of myelin gene expression are hallmarks of the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from their precursors. Here, we compared the roles of the two related extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins Tenascin C (Tnc) and Tenascin R (Tnr) in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Oligodendrocyte precursors from Tnr-deficient mice exhibited reduced differentiation, as revealed by retarded expression of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in culture. This could be rescued with purified Tnr. In contrast, when we cultured oligodendrocytes on a Tnc-containing, astrocyte-derived ECM, they barely expressed MBP. This inhibition could be overcome when we used ECM from astrocytes deficient for Tnc, suggesting that Tnc inhibits differentiation. In contrast to their antagonistic effect on differentiation, both Tnc and Tnr similarly inhibited morphologic maturation. When oligodendrocytes were cultured on the purified glycoproteins, process elaboration and membrane expansion were reduced. Both Tnc and Tnr interfered with the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. Conversely, RhoA and Rac1 activation induced by cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) increased the formation of myelin membranes, whereas Y27632-mediated inhibition of the Rho-cascade prevented it without, however, affecting the fraction of MBP-expressing cells. Because Tnc and Tnr play antagonistic roles for differentiation and comparably inhibit morphologic maturation, we conclude that independent molecular pathways regulate these processes.",M1
19455580,"Neurotrophin-3 targets the translational initiation machinery in oligodendrocytes.Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) regulates oligodendrocyte (OLG) differentiation by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Exposure of OLGs to NT-3 induces a significant increase in the levels of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>). However, we found that this stimulation occurs in the absence of measurable effects on MBP gene promoter activation or mRNA expression, suggesting that NT-3 upregulates MBP protein expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Furthermore, NT-3 also causes an increase in the levels of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin OLG glycoprotein (MOG), raising the possibility of a more general effect on myelin protein synthesis. Surprisingly, (35)S-methionine incorporation into total OLG proteins demonstrated a 50% increase in labeling following only a brief, 15-min treatment with NT-3. Such a remarkably fast response is unlikely due to transcriptional activation, reinforcing the possibility that NT-3 may play a crucial role in regulating protein expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism. In support of this idea, we found that NT-3 stimulates the phosphorylation of essential regulators of the initiation machinery, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and its inhibitory binding partner 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1), two crucial players in controlling cap-dependent protein synthesis. This stimulation involves the activation of pathways mediated by ERK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR, implicating these two kinase systems as modulators of protein synthesis in developing OLGs. Altogether, these observations show for the first time that NT-3 has the capacity of targeting the translational machinery and suggest a potential stimulatory effect of this neurotrophin on myelination by direct action on protein translation in the OLGs.",M1
19430900,"Role of normalization in the elimination of abundant myelin sequences in spinal cord cDNA libraries produced by suppression subtractive hybridization.Spinal cord libraries subtracted against visual cortex using suppression subtractive hybridization SSH are dominated by abundant gene sequences derived from myelin elements. We compared our subtracted library results of three of these abundant sequences to published expressed sequence tag libraries that are not normalized and not subtracted and presumed representatives of murine spinal cord mRNA abundance. We show that: all three abundant sequences, myelin basic protein (<e>Mbp</e>), proteolipid protein (Plp1) and Ferretin heavy chain (Fth1) are highly expressed in spinal cord when this structure is compared to visual cortex; myelin basic protein is represented in our subtracted libraries but at a low frequency, whereas Plp1 and Fth1 represent nearly one-third of all sequences in these libraries; mirror orientation selection, a procedure designed to reduce background sequences, generates libraries very similar in abundance to SSH; proteolipid protein can be reduced in these libraries by adding Plp1 sequences to the driver in the SSH procedure and also by subtracting Plp1 directly from tester and driver. We conclude that adequate normalization is essential to reduce the presence of abundant sequences in SSH libraries.",M1
19422681,"Effects of the PPAR-beta agonist GW501516 in an in vitro model of brain inflammation and antibody-induced demyelination.BACKGROUND: Brain inflammation plays a central role in numerous brain pathologies, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Microglial cells and astrocytes are the effector cells of neuroinflammation. They can be activated also by agents such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor (PPAR) pathways are involved in the control of the inflammatory processes, and PPAR-beta seems to play an important role in the regulation of central inflammation. In addition, PPAR-beta agonists were shown to have trophic effects on oligodendrocytes in vitro, and to confer partial protection in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. In the present work, a three-dimensional brain cell culture system was used as in vitro model to study antibody-induced demyelination and inflammatory responses. GW 501516, a specific PPAR-beta agonist, was examined for its capacity to protect from antibody-mediated demyelination and to prevent inflammatory responses induced by IFN-gamma and LPS. METHODS: Aggregating brain cells cultures were prepared from embryonal rat brain, and used to study the inflammatory responses triggered by IFN-gamma and LPS and by antibody-mediated demyelination induced by antibodies directed against myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The effects of GW 501516 on cellular responses were characterized by the quantification of the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), inducible NO synthase (i-NOS), PPAR-beta, PPAR-gamma, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), and high molecular weight neurofilament protein (NF-H). GFAP expression was also examined by immunocytochemistry, and microglial cells were visualized by isolectin B4 (IB4) and ED1 labeling. RESULTS: GW 501516 decreased the IFN-gamma-induced up-regulation of TNF-alpha and iNOS in accord with the proposed anti-inflammatory effects of this PPAR-beta agonist. However, it increased IL-6 m-RNA expression. In demyelinating cultures, reactivity of both microglial cells and astrocytes was observed, while the expression of the inflammatory cytokines and iNOS remained unaffected. Furthermore, GW 501516 did not protect against the demyelination-induced changes in gene expression. CONCLUSION: Although GW 501516 showed anti-inflammatory activity, it did not protect against antibody-mediated demyelination. This suggests that the protective effects of PPAR-beta agonists observed in vivo can be attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties rather than to a direct protective or trophic effect on oligodendrocytes.",M1
19405128,"Mitochondrial inhibitor 3-nitroproprionic acid enhances oxidative modification of alpha-synuclein in a transgenic mouse model of multiple system atrophy.Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and oligodendrocytic accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alphasyn). Oxidative stress has been linked to neuronal death in MSA and the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP) is known to enhance the motor deficits and neurodegeneration in transgenic mice models of MSA. However, the effect of 3NP administration on alphasyn itself has not been studied. In this context, we examined the neuropathological effects of 3NP administration in alphasyn transgenic mice expressing human alphasyn (halphasyn) under the control of the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) promoter and the effect of this administration on posttranslational modifications of alphasyn, on levels of total alphasyn, and on its solubility. We demonstrate that 3NP administration altered levels of nitrated and oxidized alphasyn in the MBP-halphasyn tg while not affecting global levels of phosphorylated or total alphasyn. 3NP administration also exaggerated neurological deficits in the MBP-halphasyn tg mice, resulting in widespread neuronal degeneration and behavioral impairment.",M1
19385666,"Myelin basic protein binds to and inhibits the fibrillar assembly of Abeta42 in vitro.The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrils into plaques within the brain parenchyma and along cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta peptides are produced through the successive cleavage of the Abeta precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase, producing peptides between 39 and 43 amino acids in length. The most common of these are Abeta40 (the most abundant) and Abeta42. Abeta42 is more fibrillogenic than Abeta40 and has been implicated in early Abeta plaque deposition. Our previous studies determined that myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) was capable of inhibiting fibril formation of a highly fibrillogenic Abeta peptide containing both E22Q (Dutch) and D23N (Iowa) mutations associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy [Hoos, M. D., et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9952-9961]. In this study, we show through a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural techniques that MBP is also capable of inhibiting the beta-sheet fibrillar assembly of the normal Abeta42 peptide. These findings suggest that MBP may play a role in regulating the deposition of Abeta42 and thereby also may regulate the early formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.",M1
19378328,"Correlation of three sciatic functional indices with histomorphometric findings in a rat sciatic nerve allograft repair model.Walking track analysis was used to measure global functional recovery following sciatic nerve injury. The correlation of morphologic outcome and different sciatic functional indices (SFIs) depends on different variables. The objective of this study was to compare three different SFIs and their correlation with histomorphometric findings in a sciatic nerve allograft repair model in the rat without (group I, n = 8) or with (group II, n = 8) daily intramuscular administration of 0.1 mg/kg FK 506. The correlation of SFIs with each other and with the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) density of nerve sections proximal, median, and distal to sciatic nerve grafts (1.5 cm) at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks postoperation (p.o.) was calculated, and unoperated animals served as controls (n = 8). Significant differences between SFIs calculated for experimental groups I and II at 12 and 16 weeks p.o. suggested that superior functional nerve recovery occurred in group II. However, there were significant differences between all SFIs at 16 weeks p.o. in group II, whereas only differences between SFI 1 and SFI 2 + 3 occurred in group I. SFIs of group II did not reach the values of the unoperated group. There were significant differences between the histomorphometric outcomes of groups I and II. There was no significant difference of MBP density between group II and the unoperated group, suggesting complete morphologic recovery. In conclusion, we found significant correlation between the MBP densities of groups I and II and all SFIs, suggesting a close relationship between histomorphometric and functional findings.

19369548,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent interaction of myelin basic protein with the plasma membrane in oligodendroglial cells and its rapid perturbation by elevated calcium.Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) is an essential structural component of CNS myelin. The electrostatic association of this positively charged protein with myelin-forming membranes is a crucial step in myelination, but the mechanism that regulates myelin membrane targeting is not known. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is important for the stable association of MBP with cellular membranes. In oligodendrocytes, overexpression of synaptojanin 1-derived phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase, which selectively hydrolyzes membrane PIP2, causes the detachment of MBP from the plasma membrane. In addition, constitutively active Arf6/Q67L induces the formation of PIP2-enriched endosomal vacuoles, leading to the redistribution of MBP to intracellular vesicles. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging revealed an interaction of the PIP2 sensing probe PH-PLCdelta1 with wild-type MBP, but not with a mutant MBP isoform that fails to associate with the plasma membrane. Moreover, increasing intracellular Ca(2+), followed by phospholipase C-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis, as well as reduction of the membrane charge by ATP depletion, resulted in the dissociation of MBP from the glial plasma membrane. When the corpus callosum of mice was analyzed in acute brain slices by electron microscopy, the reduction of membrane surface charge led to the loss of myelin compaction and rapid vesiculation. Together, these results establish that PIP2 is an essential determinant for stable membrane binding of MBP and provide a novel link between glial phosphoinositol metabolism and MBP function in development and disease.",M1
19350586,"Curing CNS autoimmune disease with myelin-reactive Foxp3+ Treg.The potential use of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg as a cellular therapy for autoimmune disease is of great interest. For clinical translation, the key objective is to reverse established disease. Here we demonstrate that myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-reactive CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg from TCR Tg mice, but not polyclonal (non-MBP-reactive) Treg, can transfer efficient protection against MBP-induced EAE when used either directly from donor mice, or after in vitro expansion. MBP-reactive Treg transfer also showed some ability to improve recovery from EAE initiated by T cells recognizing a distinct CNS autoantigen, proteolipid protein. Importantly, we also demonstrate for the first time in the context of EAE that in vitro-expanded naturally occurring MBP-reactive Treg can prevent disease relapse when given after the onset of clinical EAE. Our study also contains data pertaining to the most effective Treg sub-population in vivo (CD4(+)CD25(+)CD62L(hi)) and shows that their potent suppressive effects reflect stable expression of Foxp3, although not CD25 or CD62L. Our data provide proof of the principle that Treg-based therapies can cure CNS autoimmune disease, highlight the challenges for clinical translation and open new avenues for assessing how changing immune function via Treg activity might impact on neurodegeneration and repair.",M1
19347844,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the rat.There are several diverse rat models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that can be used to investigate the pathogenesis and regulation of autoimmunity against CNS myelin. The disease course of these models ranges from an acute monophasic disease with limited demyelination to a chronic relapsing or chronic progressive course marked by severe demyelination. These models enable the study of encephalitogenic T cells and demyelinating antibody specific for major neuroantigens such as myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), or proteolipid protein (PLP), among other important CNS autoantigens. Overall, this unit provides an overview of common methods for induction of active and passive EAE, assessment and analysis of clinical disease, preparation and purification of myelin basic protein, and derivation of neuroantigen-specific rat T cell lines. This unit also provides a brief discussion of the basic characteristics of these models.",M1
19300513,"Matrix metalloproteinase proteolysis of the myelin basic protein isoforms is a source of immunogenic peptides in autoimmune multiple sclerosis.BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) and demyelination leading to autoimmune multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. The splice variants of the single MBP gene (Golli-MBP BG21 and J37) are widely expressed in the neurons and also in the immune cells. The relative contribution of the individual MMPs to the MBP cleavage is not known. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate which MMP plays the primary role in cleaving MBP, we determined the efficiency of MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP and MT6-MMP in the cleavage of the MBP, BG21 and J37 isoforms in the in vitro cleavage reactions followed by mass-spectroscopy analysis of the cleavage fragments. As a result, we identified the MMP cleavage sites and the sequence of the resulting fragments. We determined that MBP, BG21 and J37 are highly sensitive to redundant MMP proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin), however, was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. Using the mixed lymphocyte culture assay, we demonstrated that MT6-MMP proteolysis of the MBP isoforms readily generated, with a near quantitative yield, the immunogenic N-terminal 1-15 MBP peptide. This peptide selectively stimulated the proliferation of the PGPR7.5 T cell clone isolated from mice with EAE and specific for the 1-15 MBP fragment presented in the MHC H-2(U) context. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In sum, our biochemical observations led us to hypothesize that MT6-MMP, which is activated by furin and associated with the lipid rafts, plays an important role in MS pathology and that MT6-MMP is a novel and promising drug target in MS especially when compared with other individual MMPs.",M1
19299462,"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 is an essential receptor for myelin phagocytosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which myelin is progressively degraded. Because degraded myelin may both initiate and accelerate disease progression, clearing degraded myelin from extracellular spaces may be critical. In this study, we prepared myelin vesicles (MV) from rat brains as a model of degraded myelin. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) rapidly internalized MVs, which accumulated in lysosomes only when these cells expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1). Receptor-associated protein (RAP), which binds LRP1 and inhibits interaction with other ligands, blocked MV uptake by LRP1-expressing MEFs. As a complementary approach, we prepared primary cultures of rat astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. All three cell types expressed LRP1 and mediated MV uptake, which was inhibited by RAP. LRP1 gene-silencing in oligodendrocytes also blocked MV uptake. Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), which was expressed as a recombinant protein, bound directly to LRP1. MBP-specific antibody inhibited MV uptake by oligodendrocytes. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, LRP1 protein expression was substantially increased in the cerebellum and spinal cord. LRP1 colocalized with multiple CNS cell types. These studies establish LRP1 as a major receptor for phagocytosis of degraded myelin, which may function alone or in concert with co-receptors previously implicated in myelin phagocytosis.",M1
19272755,"Metabolic abnormalities in fronto-striatal-thalamic white matter tracts in schizophrenia.The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is the major white matter tract providing reciprocal connections between the frontal cortex, striatum and thalamus. Mounting evidence suggests that this tract may be affected in schizophrenia, with brain imaging studies reporting reductions in white matter volume and density, changes in fractional anisotropy and reduced asymmetry. However, the molecular correlates of these deficits are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to identify alterations in protein and metabolite levels in the ALIC in schizophrenia. Samples were obtained post-mortem from individuals with schizophrenia (n=15) and non-psychiatric controls (n=13). Immunoreactivity for the myelin-associated protein myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), and the axonal-associated proteins phosphorylated neurofilament and SNAP-25 was measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Metabolite concentrations were quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy. Levels of myelin- or axonal-associated proteins did not differ between groups. Overall differences in metabolite concentrations were observed between the two groups (MANOVA F=2.685, p=0.036), with post-hoc tests revealing lower lactate (19%) and alanine (24%) levels in the schizophrenia group relative to controls. Observed changes in lactate and alanine levels indicate metabolic abnormalities within the ALIC in schizophrenia.",M1
19257891,"Neural differentiation potential of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells: misleading marker gene expression.BACKGROUND: In contrast to pluripotent embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells have been considered to be multipotent, being somewhat more restricted in their differentiation capacity and only giving rise to cell types related to their tissue of origin. Several studies, however, have reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are capable of transdifferentiating to neural cell types, effectively crossing normal lineage restriction boundaries. Such reports have been based on the detection of neural-related proteins by the differentiated MSCs. In order to assess the potential of human adult MSCs to undergo true differentiation to a neural lineage and to determine the degree of homogeneity between donor samples, we have used RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry to investigate the basal expression of a range of neural related mRNAs and proteins in populations of non-differentiated MSCs obtained from 4 donors. RESULTS: The expression analysis revealed that several of the commonly used marker genes from other studies like nestin, Enolase2 and microtubule associated protein 1b (MAP1b) are already expressed by undifferentiated human MSCs. Furthermore, mRNA for some of the neural-related transcription factors, e.g. Engrailed-1 and Nurr1 were also strongly expressed. However, several other neural-related mRNAs (e.g. DRD2, enolase2, NFL and <e>MBP</e>) could be identified, but not in all donor samples. Similarly, synaptic vesicle-related mRNA, STX1A could only be detected in 2 of the 4 undifferentiated donor hMSC samples. More significantly, each donor sample revealed a unique expression pattern, demonstrating a significant variation of marker expression. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the existence of an inter-donor variability of expression of neural-related markers in human MSC samples that has not previously been described. This donor-related heterogeneity might influence the reproducibility of transdifferentiation protocols as well as contributing to the ongoing controversy about differentiation capacities of MSCs. Therefore, further studies need to consider the differences between donor samples prior to any treatment as well as the possibility of harvesting donor cells that may be inappropriate for transplantation strategies.",M1
19246291,"[Evaluation of myelin basic protein levels with receiver operating characteristic curves for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis]OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and serum myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) levels in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the CSF and serum levels of MBP in patients with MS (n=45), patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (n=36) and control subjects (control) (n=33). The sensitivity and specificity of MBP in CSF and serum in the diagnosis of MS were evaluated using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The MBP levels in CSF and serum both increased significantly in MS group as compared with those in GBS (P&lt;0.01) and control groups (P&lt;0.01). The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of MBP in CSF was 0.853-/+0.037 for MS diagnosis, and with the optimal cut-off value of 0.87 pg/ml, CSF MBP showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 83.7% and specificity of 78.3%. The AUC of the ROC curve of serum MBP was 0.761-/+0.046, and the optimal cut-off value of 0.25 pg/ml resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 62.8% and specificity of 73.9%. No statistically significant difference was found between the two AUCs (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CSF and serum MBP levels allows accurate diagnosis of MS, and MBP level in the CSF has greater diagnostic sensitivity than serum MBP. The combination of both CSF and serum MBP levels may serve as a sensitive index for the diagnosis of MS.",M1
19230777,"Autologous attenuated T-cell vaccine (Tovaxin) dose escalation in multiple sclerosis relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive patients nonresponsive to approved immunomodulatory therapies.An open-label dose escalation study of T-cell vaccination in multiple sclerosis patients was conducted using attenuated myelin reactive T-cells (MRTC) selected with six myelin peptides, two each from <e>MBP</e>, PLP and MOG. The dose range of subcutaneous injections given at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20 was 6-9E6, 30-45E6 and 60-90E6 irradiated MRTC. Assessments were over 52 weeks for MRTC levels, EDSS, MSIS-29, brain MRI and relapses. The 30-45E6 dose was the most effective with reductions in MRTC ranging from 92.4% at week 5 to 64.8% at week 52. The reduction in relapses compared to baseline for the M-ITT and evaluable per-protocol analyses were 63.5%, and 85.0% at week 52. The MRI lesions were stable while there was an improvement trend in the EDSS and MSIS-29 physical subscore following the second injection. Adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity with mild injection site reactions occurring with increasing dosage. The mid-dose was selected for further clinical development studies because of the rapid depletion of peripheral blood MRTC and a trend for improvements in clinical outcomes following immunization.",M1

EAE was induced by single subcutaneous injection of 100 microg of MBP in complete Freund's adjuvant. Hemoperfusion was performed on the stage of EAE manifestation or in latent period. It was found that immunoadsorbent has the highest therapeutic efficacy and allows to eliminate up to 32% anti-MBP antibodies from the serum of guinea pigs with EAE, has up to 84% and 90% of adsorptive capacity of small and middle weight endogenous substances, respectively, and reduces the level of metabolites with molecular weight less than 30 kDa in blood plasma up to 36%.",M1
19224575,"17beta-estradiol protects against hypoxic/ischemic white matter damage in the neonatal rat brain.Developing oligodendrocytes (pre-OLs) are highly vulnerable to hypoxic-ischemic injury and associated excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. 17beta-Estradiol plays an important role in the development and function of the CNS and is neuroprotective. The sudden drop in circulating estrogen after birth may enhance the susceptibility of developing OLs to injury. Estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ER-beta are both expressed in OLs. We examined the effect of 17beta-estradiol on oxygen-glucose deprivation and oxidative stress-induced cell death in rat pre-OLs in vitro and on hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in vivo. Pre-OLs in culture were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or glutathione depletion in the presence or absence of 17beta-estradiol. LDH release, the Alamar blue assay, and phase-contrast microscopy were used to assess cell viability. Hypoxic-ischemic injury was generated in 6-day-old rats (P6) by unilateral carotid ligation and hypoxia (6% O(2) for 1 hr). Rat pups received one intraperitoneal injection of 300 or 600 microg/kg 17beta-estradiol or vehicle 12 hr prior to the surgical procedure. Injury was assessed by myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) immunocytochemistry at P10. 17beta-Estradiol produced significant protection against OGD-induced cell death in primary OLs (EC(50) = 1.3 +/- 0.46 x 10(-9) M) and against oxidative stress. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol attenuated the loss of MBP labeling in P10 pups ipsilateral to the carotid ligation. These results suggest a potential role for estrogens in attenuation of hypoxic-ischemic and oxidative injury to developing OLs and in the prevention of periventricular leukomalacia.",M1
19218452,"Interaction forces and adhesion of supported myelin lipid bilayers modulated by myelin basic protein.Force-distance measurements between supported lipid bilayers mimicking the cytoplasmic surface of myelin at various surface coverages of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) indicate that maximum adhesion and minimum cytoplasmic spacing occur when each negative lipid in the membrane can bind to a positive arginine or lysine group on MBP. At the optimal lipid/protein ratio, additional attractive forces are provided by hydrophobic, van der Waals, and weak dipolar interactions between zwitterionic groups on the lipids and MBP. When MBP is depleted, the adhesion decreases and the cytoplasmic space swells; when MBP is in excess, the bilayers swell even more. Excess MBP forms a weak gel between the surfaces, which collapses on compression. The organization and proper functioning of myelin can be understood in terms of physical noncovalent forces that are optimized at a particular combination of both the amounts of and ratio between the charged lipids and MBP. Thus loss of adhesion, possibly contributing to demyelination, can be brought about by either an excess or deficit of MBP or anionic lipids.",M1
19191913,"Autoantibodies to myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in healthy individuals and in patients with multiple sclerosis: a role in regulating cytokine responses to MBP.Anti-myelin basic protein (-MBP) autoantibodies have generally been considered to be absent from sera from healthy individuals, but to be detectable in sera from some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, their pathogenic role is uncertain. We demonstrate the presence of MBP-reactive autoantibodies in sera from 17 healthy individuals and 17 MS patients. The addition of MBP to the sera caused a dose-dependent deposition of MBP and co-deposition of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and fragments of complement component 3 (C3) on allogeneic monocytes. Calcium chelation abrogated the immunoglobulin deposition, indicating that formation of complement-activating immune complexes played a role in the binding process. Furthermore, MBP elicited tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 production by normal mononuclear cells in the presence of serum from both patients and controls. Mononuclear cells from MS patients responded to MBP with the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4 and IL-5, in addition to TNF-alpha and IL-10. The production of IFN-gamma and IL-5 was increased when MS serum was added rather than normal serum. Denaturation of MBP strongly inhibited MBP deposition and the MBP-induced IgM deposition and cytokine production, indicating that these events were facilitated by autoantibodies recognizing conformational epitopes on MBP. We infer that MBP-elicited TNF-alpha and IL-10 responses are promoted to equal extents by naturally occurring MBP autoantibodies and autoantibodies contained in MS sera. However, the latter seem to be more efficient in facilitating the production of IFN-gamma and IL-5.",M1
19178193,"Influence of membrane surface charge and post-translational modifications to myelin basic protein on its ability to tether the Fyn-SH3 domain to a membrane in vitro.Myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a highly post-translationally modified, multifunctional structural component of central nervous system myelin, adhering to phospholipid membranes and assembling cytoskeletal proteins, and has previously been shown to bind SH3 domains in vitro and tether them to a membrane surface [Polverini, E., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 267-282]. Since molecular modeling shows that the Fyn-SH3 domain has a negative surface charge density even after binding the MBP ligand, we have investigated the influence of negative membrane surface charge and the effects of post-translational modifications to MBP on the interaction of the Fyn-SH3 domain with membrane-associated MBP. Using a sedimentation assay with multilamellar vesicles consisting of neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC) and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol (PI), we demonstrate that increasing the negative surface charge of the membrane by increasing the proportion of PI reduces the amount of Fyn-SH3 domain that binds to membrane-associated MBP, due to electrostatic repulsion. When one of the phosphoinositides, PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P(2) was substituted for PI in equal proportion, none of the Fyn-SH3 domain bound to MBP under the conditions that were used. Post-translational modifications of MBP which reduced its net positive charge, i.e., phosphorylation or arginine deimination, increased the degree of repulsion of Fyn-SH3 from the membrane surface, an effect further modulated by the lipid charge. This study suggests that changes in membrane negative surface charge due to protein or lipid modifications, which could occur during cell signaling, can regulate the binding of the Fyn-SH3 domain to membrane-associated MBP and thus could regulate the activity of Fyn at the oligodendrocyte membrane surface.",M1
19145069,"Partial inhibition of the proteasome enhances the activity of the myelin basic protein promoter.We have previously shown that low concentrations of a specific proteasome inhibitor accelerate exit from the cell cycle and enhance oligodendroglial cell (OLGc) differentiation. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process, OLGcs of the N20.1 cell line, transfected with a reporter gene driven by the <e>MBP</e> promoter, were treated with proteasome inhibitors and/or inhibitors of different signaling pathways. Partial proteasome inhibition resulted in enhanced activation of the MBP promoter which involved the tyrosine kinase, PI3-Akt and PKC pathways, accompanied by an increase in the levels of p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and Sp1 and by a decrease in Nkx2.2. Binding of Sp1 to DNA was also increased. These results were not observed when the Sp1 binding site was mutated. We conclude that the enhanced activation of the MBP promoter induced by partial inhibition of the proteasome could be due, at least in part, to the stabilization of p27(Kip1) and Sp1.",M1
19134474,"Induced secondary structure and polymorphism in an intrinsically disordered structural linker of the CNS: solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy of myelin basic protein bound to actin.The 18.5 kDa isoform of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a peripheral membrane protein that maintains the structural integrity of the myelin sheath of the central nervous system by conjoining the cytoplasmic leaflets of oligodendrocytes and by linking the myelin membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton whose assembly it strongly promotes. It is a multifunctional, intrinsically disordered protein that behaves primarily as a structural stabilizer, but with elements of a transient or induced secondary structure that represent binding sites for calmodulin or SH3-domain-containing proteins, inter alia. In this study we used solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the conformation of 18.5 kDa MBP in association with actin microfilaments and bundles. FTIR spectroscopy of fully (13)C,(15)N-labeled MBP complexed with unlabeled F-actin showed induced folding of both protein partners, viz., some increase in beta-sheet content in actin, and increases in both alpha-helix and beta-sheet content in MBP, albeit with considerable extended structure remaining. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy revealed that MBP in MBP-actin assemblies is structurally heterogeneous but gains ordered secondary structure elements (both alpha-helical and beta-sheet), particularly in the terminal fragments and in a central immunodominant epitope. The overall conformational polymorphism of MBP is consistent with its in vivo roles as both a linker (membranes and cytoskeleton) and a putative signaling hub.",M1
19132105,"Variations in the electrostatic landscape of class II human leukocyte antigen molecule induced by modifications in the myelin basic protein peptide: a theoretical approach.The receptor-ligand interactions involved in the formation of the complex between Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex molecules and antigenic peptides, which are essential for establishing an adaptive immunological response, were analyzed in the Class II Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)--Myelin Basic Protein (<e>MBP</e>) peptide complex (HLA-DRbeta1*1501-MBP) using a multipolar molecular electrostatic potential approach. The Human Leukocyte Antigen--peptide complex system was divided into four pockets together with their respective peptide fragment and the corresponding occupying amino acid was replaced by each of the remaining 19 amino acids. Partial atomic charges were calculated by a quantum chemistry approach at the Hatree Fock/3-21*G level, to study the behavior of monopole, dipole and quadrupole electrostatic multipolar moments. Two types of electrostatic behavior were distinguished in the pockets' amino acids:  anchoring  located in Pocket 1 and 4, and  recognition  located in Pocket 4 and 7. According to variations in the electrostatic landscape, pockets were ordered as: Pocket 1&gt;Pocket 9&gt;&gt;Pocket 4 approximately Pocket 7 which is in agreement with the binding ability reported for Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex pockets. In the same way, amino acids occupying the polymorphic positions beta13R, beta26F, beta28D, beta9W, beta74A, beta47F and beta57D were shown to be key for this Receptor-Ligand interaction. The results show that the multipolar molecular electrostatic potential approach is appropriate for characterizing receptor-ligand interactions in the MHC-antigenic peptide complex, which could have potential implications for synthetic vaccine design.",M1
19104370,"Adverse effects of antenatal glucocorticoids on cerebral myelination in sheep.OBJECTIVE: To determine in fetal sheep the effect of betamethasone on myelination in relation to stage of myelination, number of treatment courses, dose, and route of administration. METHODS: Fetal expression of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), a marker of mature oligodendrocytes and myelin, was determined between 0.27 and 0.93 gestation. Short-term betamethasone effects were examined 24 hours after one maternal intramuscular treatment course (weight adjusted to equal the clinical dose of 2 x 8 mg betamethasone to a 70-kg woman) at 0.63, 0.75, and 0.87 gestation or after continuous 48-hour fetal intravenous infusion at 0.75 and 0.87 gestation. Lasting effects were examined 20 days after one and two treatment courses weight-adapted to the clinical dose of 2 x 8 mg or 2 x 12 mg betamethasone at 0.75 gestation. RESULTS: Myelin basic protein immunoreactivity was first detected in the internal capsule at 0.53 gestation, followed by the centrum semiovale, the superficial white matter, and corpus callosum at 0.63 gestation. Within 24 hours after treatment, betamethasone reduced the number of mature oligodendrocytes and MBP immunoreactivity. The effect decreased with gestational age. Maternal and fetal betamethasone administration had similar effects. Loss of MBP immunoreactivity was not reversed 20 days after two treatment courses, independent of dose. CONCLUSION: Betamethasone-induced delayed cerebral myelination is dependent on the stage of brain development in sheep. Betamethasone-related disturbances in myelination and any potential contribution to childhood behavior deficits need to be confirmed in clinical studies.",M1
19103262,"Combination of deferoxamine and erythropoietin: therapy for hypoxia-ischemia-induced brain injury in the neonatal rat?Deferoxamine (DFO) and erythropoietin (EPO) have each been shown to provide neuroprotection in neonatal rodent models of brain injury. In view of the described anti-oxidative actions of DFO and the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of EPO, we hypothesized that the combination of DFO and EPO would increase neuroprotection after neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury as compared to single DFO or EPO treatment. At postnatal day 7 rats underwent right common carotid artery occlusion followed by a 90-min exposure to 8% oxygen. Rats were treated intraperitoneally with DFO (200mg/kg), recombinant human EPO (1 kU/kg), a combination of DFO-EPO or vehicle at 0, 24 and 48 h after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and were sacrificed at 72 h. DFO-EPO administration reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. Early neuronal damage was assessed by staining for microtubuli-associated protein (MAP)-2. In our model 63+/-9% loss of ipsilateral MAP-2 was observed after HI, indicating extensive brain injury. DFO, EPO or DFO-EPO treatment did not improve neuronal integrity as defined by MAP-2. Cerebral white matter tracts were stained for myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), a constituent of myelin. Hypoxia-ischemia strongly reduced MBP staining which suggests white matter damage. However, DFO, EPO and DFO-EPO treatment had no effect on the loss of MBP staining. Finally, HI-induced loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase staining was not attenuated by DFO, EPO or DFO-EPO. Although DFO-EPO treatment reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3(+) cells, treatment with DFO, EPO, or with the combination of DFO and EPO did not protect against gray or white matter damage in the experimental setting applied.",M1
19077446,"Neuropathy of gastrointestinal Chagas' disease: immune response to myelin antigens.Most reports of autoimmune response during infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi have dealt with the cardiomyopathic form of Chagas' disease, but little is known about the mechanisms of tissue damage involved in the gastrointestinal form, which was studied here. Chronically infected patients with a severe gastrointestinal form of Chagas' disease present increased antibody production and proliferative responses to peripheral myelin components, such as myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), which is homologous to the P1 protein fraction of peripheral myelin. T lymphocytes preferentially recognize a region on the MBP molecule (1-30), which suggests that the MBP is a potential target on the peripheral nerve for autoimmune reactions in patients with gastrointestinal lesions resulting from Chagas' disease.",M1
19072222,"Design and synthesis of a cyclic double mutant peptide (cyclo(87-99)[A91,A96]MBP87-99) induces altered responses in mice after conjugation to mannan: implications in the immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis.Altered peptide ligands that alter immune responses are a promising approach to the immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis. Cyclic peptides are of interest because the limited stability of linear peptides restricts their use in vivo. We designed and synthesized a cyclic double mutant peptide from <e>MBP</e>(87-99)-[cyclo(87-99)[A(91),A(96)]MBP(87-99)]. Immunization of mice, in CFA reduced Th1 responses.

19055697,"IL-17 eliminates the therapeutic effects of myelin basic protein-induced nasal tolerance in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by activating IL-6.Interleukin (IL)-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine primarily secreted by Th17 cells, which are a CD4(+) T-cell subset. Th17 cells and IL-17 are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and in its established animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it is unclear whether IL-17 contributes to EAE immune tolerance. We used the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) peptide MBP 68-86 to induce nasal tolerance to EAE, and simultaneously interfered with the tolerance by treatment with different doses of IL-17. We found that IL-17 dramatically interfered with MBP 68-86-induced immune tolerance. IL-17 administration increased IL-6 release, skewing T cell differentiation towards Th17 cells and decreasing the number of Treg cells. This led to an imbalance between Treg cells and Th17 cells and spurred the development of EAE.",M1
19053745,"Citrullination of linear and cyclic altered peptide ligands from myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>(87-99)) epitope elicits a Th1 polarized response by T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients: implications in triggering disease.Derangement of cellular immunity is central in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is often manifested by abnormal cytokine production. We investigated cytokine secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 18 MS patients and 15 controls and correlated cytokine polarization with the nature of antigenic stimulus. We synthesized two novel citrullinated peptides, linear [Cit(91), Ala(96), Cit(97)]MBP(87-99) and cyclo(87-99)[Cit(91), Ala(96), Cit(97)]MBP(87-99) that resulted from citrullination of 91,97 Arg residues in antagonists, linear [Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) and cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) peptides. PBMC from MS patients and controls were cultured with citrullinated peptides, and both peptides caused a Th1 polarization in all MS patients studied. In contrast, culture with noncitrullinated MBP peptides resulted in heterogeneous cytokine secretion that differed between individual patients. Thus, citrullination of self-antigens may potentially trigger disease in susceptible individuals. This finding may open new avenues in drug design of new substances that inhibit citrullination and arrest epitope spreading and worsening of MS.",M1
19036358,"Cathepsin G is differentially expressed in primary human antigen-presenting cells.Cathepsins are required for the processing of antigens in order to make them suitable for loading on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, for subsequent presentation to CD4(+) T cells. It was shown that antigen processing in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC), a commonly used DC model, is different from that of primary human DC. Here, we report that the two subsets of human myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) differ in their cathepsin distribution. The serine protease cathepsin G (CatG) was detected in mDC1, mDC2, pDC, cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) and high levels of CatG were determined in pDC. To address the role of CatG in the processing and presentation of a Multiple Sclerosis-associated autoantigen myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>), we used a non-CatG expressing fibroblast cell line and fibroblasts, which were preloaded with purified CatG. We find that preloading fibroblasts with CatG results in a decrease of MBP84-98-specific T cell proliferation, when compared to control cells. Our data suggest a different processing signature in primary human antigen-presenting cells and CatG may be of functional importance.",M1
19017944,"Targeting the neonatal fc receptor for antigen delivery using engineered fc fragments.The development of approaches for Ag delivery to the appropriate subcellular compartments of APCs and the optimization of Ag persistence are both of central relevance for the induction of protective immunity or tolerance. The expression of the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, in APCs and its localization to the endosomal system suggest that it might serve as a target for Ag delivery using engineered Fc fragment-epitope fusions. The impact of FcRn binding characteristics of an Fc fragment on in vivo persistence allows this property to also be modulated. We have therefore generated recombinant Fc (mouse IgG1-derived) fusions containing the N-terminal epitope of myelin basic protein that is associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in H-2(u) mice. The Fc fragments have distinct binding properties for FcRn that result in differences in intracellular trafficking and in vivo half-lives, allowing the impact of these characteristics on CD4(+) T cell responses to be evaluated. To dissect the relative roles of FcRn and the  classical  FcgammaRs in Ag delivery, analogous aglycosylated Fc-<e>MBP</e> fusions have been generated. We show that engineered Fc fragments with increased affinities for FcRn at pH 6.0-7.4 are more effective in delivering Ag to FcRn-expressing APCs in vitro relative to their lower affinity counterparts. However, higher affinity of the FcRn-Fc interaction at near neutral pH results in decreased in vivo persistence. The trade-off between improved FcRn targeting efficiency and lower half-life becomes apparent during analyses of T cell proliferative responses in mice, particularly when Fc-MBP fusions with both FcRn and FcgammaR binding activity are used.",M1
19008075,"Differential induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by myelin basic protein molecular mimics in mice humanized for HLA-DR2 and an <e>MBP</e>(85-99)-specific T cell receptor.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neurological disease characterized by infiltration of peripheral inflammatory cells to the central nervous system (CNS) and demyelination of CNS white matter. Epidemiological evidence suggests a possible infectious trigger. One potential mechanism by which an infectious agent may trigger MS is via molecular mimicry wherein T cells generated against foreign epitopes cross-react with self-myelin epitopes, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), with sufficient sequence similarity. It has been previously reported that an MBP(85-99)-reactive T cell clone derived from an MS patient cross-reacted with multiple bacterial-derived mimic peptides in vitro. We show that the same mimic peptides can induce clinical disease in two different strains of mice transgenic for both a human MBP(85-99)-specific TCR and HLA-DR2 (MHC II), albeit with different disease patterns - relapsing-remitting vs. monophasic. Interestingly, clinical disease correlates with CNS infiltration of CD4(+) T cells and F4/80(+) macrophages, but not with in vitro proliferative or cytokine responses of splenocytes in response to either MBP(85-99) or its mimics.",M1

Neonatal and adult myelin-deficient shiverer (shi) mice, bearing a mutation of the myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) gene, have been used extensively as hosts for testing cell engraftment, migration, and myelination, but relatively little progress has been made in reversing shi motor deficits.

The extended solvation model was used to reproduce the enthalpies of MBP+M2+ interactions. The solvation parameters recovered from the extended solvation model were attributed to the structural change of MBP due to the metal ion interaction. It was found that there is a set of two identical and noninteracting binding sites for Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.",M1
18950871,"IL-6 transsignalling modulates the early effector phase of EAE and targets the blood-brain barrier.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It exerts its cellular effects by a membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), or, alternatively, by forming a complex with the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), a process named IL-6 transsignalling. Here we investigate the role of IL-6 transsignalling in myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-induced EAE in the Lewis rat. In vivo blockade of IL-6 transsignalling by the injection of a specifically designed gp130-Fc fusion protein significantly delayed the onset of adoptively transferred EAE in comparison to control rats injected with PBS or isotype IgG. Histological evaluation on day 3 after immunization revealed reduced numbers of T cells and macrophages in the lumbar spinal cord of gp130-Fc treated rats. At the same time, blockade of IL-6 transsignalling resulted in a reduced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on spinal cord microvessels while experiments in cell culture failed to show a direct effect on the regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules. In experiments including active EAE and T cell culture, inhibition of IL-6 transsignalling mildly increased T cell proliferation, but did not change severity of active MBP-EAE or regulate Th1/Th17 responses. We conclude that IL-6 transsignalling may play a role in autoimmune inflammation of the CNS mainly by regulating early expression of adhesion molecules, possibly via cellular networks at the blood-brain barrier.",M1
18930441,"Myelin basic protein-specific T lymphocytes proliferation and programmed cell death in demyelinating diseases.A dynamic equilibrium between proliferation and programmed cell death (PCD) of auto-reactive T lymphocytes plays a pivotal role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. We analyzed T lymphocytes myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>)-specific PCD and proliferation in demyelinating diseases. Results showed that MBP-specific PCD was significantly decreased in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), not determined leukoencephalopathy (NDLE), and acute MS (AMS) patients compared to patients with stable MS (SMS) and healthy controls. MBP-specific proliferation/PCD rates were high in CD4+ T lymphocytes of PML, NDLE, and AMS patients, and in CD8+ T cells of PML and AMS individuals alone. Alterations of the balance between MBP-specific proliferation and PCD are present in demyelinating diseases and could play a major role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",M1
18926351,"Myelin basic protein in cerebrospinal fluid: a predictive marker of delayed encephalopathy from carbon monoxide poisoning.This study was designed to investigate whether myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be a predictive marker of delayed encephalopathy from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Five patients with CO poisoning were included in the study. The CSF was serially sampled to determine the MBP concentration. All patients were classified into group DE or group non-DE according to whether delayed encephalopathy developed or not. In all 3 patients in group DE, the MBP levels in the CSF were markedly elevated preceding the clinical manifestations of delayed encephalopathy. In both group non-DE patients, the MBP concentrations in the CSF were never elevated. Elevated MBP concentrations in the CSF may represent a predictive marker of delayed encephalopathy from CO poisoning, leading to a more appropriate triage of patients with CO poisoning.",M1
18839277,"STAT3 silencing with lentivirus inhibits growth and induces apoptosis and differentiation of U251 cells.Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common type of central nervous system tumor in humans, is highly proliferative and resistant to apoptosis associated with genetic mutations that deregulate cell cycle. Signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a key signal transduction protein that mediated signaling by cytokines and contributed to oncogenesis. It is constitutively activated in numerous cancers including glioblastoma. To determine the effect on proliferation and differentiation of glioblastoma U251 cells after inhibiting STAT3 expression by RNAi, STAT3 gene was silenced with lentivirus vector in U251 cells. We demonstrate that a lentivirus-based shRNA vector had highly infecting efficiency to U251 cells and lentivirus vector-mediated RNAi significantly suppressed Stat3 expression and activation in U251 cells. Knockdown of STAT3 expression by RNAi suppressed the growth and induced apoptosis of U251 cells by down-regulating expression of Bcl-2. It was found that the cell proportion of G0/G1 phase significantly increased after silencing Stat3 by down-regulating expression of cyclin D1. Knockdown of Stat3 also induces morphological changes of U251 cell. It increases significantly expression of myelin basic protein (<e>MBP</e>) in U251 cells. This study demonstrates that STAT3 silencing with lentivirus effectively inhibits STAT3 gene expression and activation. Stat3 is associated with the survival, growth and differentiation of U251 cells. Lentivirus vector-mediated RNAi may be serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of GBM with expression constitutively and activation of STAT3 gene.",M1
19465640,"Characterization of the interaction between serum mannan-binding protein and nucleic acid ligands.Serum <e>MBP</e>, also known as MBL, is a C-type lectin that is known to be a soluble host defense factor involved in innate immunity. It has been well established that dying microbes and apoptotic cells release highly viscous DNA that induces inflammation and septic shock, and apoptotic cells display fragmented DNA on their surfaces. However, PRRs that mediate the recognition and clearance of free DNA and fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells have not been characterized clearly. Although MBP was reported recently to bind DNA as a novel ligand, binding characterization and the recognition implications have not been addressed yet. In this study, we show that MBP can bind DNA and RNA in a calcium-dependent manner from a variety of origins, including bacteria, plasmids, synthetic oligonucleotides, and fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells. Direct binding and competition studies indicate that MBP binds nucleic acids via its CRD to varying degrees and that MBP binds dsDNA more effectively than ssDNA and ssRNA. Furthermore, we reveal that the MBP-DNA complex does not trigger complement activation via the MBP lectin pathway, and the lectin pathway of complement activation is required for MBP-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis of targets bearing MBP ligands and that MBP can recognize the fragmented DNA presented on apoptotic cells. Therefore, we propose that the MBP lectin pathway may support effective recognition and clearance of cellular debris by facilitating phagocytosis, possibly through immunomodulatory mechanisms, thus preventing autoimmunity.",M2
19129245,"Highly fucosylated N-glycan ligands for mannan-binding protein expressed specifically on CD26 (DPPVI) isolated from a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, SW1116.The serum mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a host defense C-type lectin specific for mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose residues, and exhibits growth inhibitory activity toward human colorectal carcinoma cells. The MBP-ligand oligosaccharides (MLO) isolated from a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, SW1116, are large, multiantennary N-glycans with highly fucosylated polylactosamine-type structures having Le(b)-Le(a) or tandem repeats of the Le(a) structure at their nonreducing ends. In this study, we isolated the major MBP-ligand glycoproteins from SW1116 cell lysates with an MBP column and identified them as CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) (110 kDa) and CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc)/4F2hc (82 kDa). Glycosidase digestion revealed that CD26 contained such complex-type N-glycans that appear to mediate the MBP binding. MALDI-MS of the N-glycans released from CD26 by PNGase F demonstrated conclusively that CD26 is the major MLO-carrying protein. More interestingly, a comparison of the N-glycans released from the MBP-binding and non-MBP-binding glycopeptides suggested that complex-type N-glycans carrying a minimum of 4 Le(a)/Le(b) epitopes arranged either as multimeric tandem repeats or terminal epitopes on multiantennary structures are critically important for the high affinity binding to MBP. Analysis of the N-glycan attachment sites demonstrated that the high affinity MLO was expressed preferentially at some N-glycosylation sites, but this site preference was not so stringent. Finally, hypothetical 3D models of tandem repeats of the Le(a) epitope and the MBP-Lewis oligosaccharide complex were presented.",M2
18589813,"[Cloning, sequencing analysis and expression of a putative mannose-binding lectin gene from Polygonatum roseum in Xinjiang]The genomic DNA were extracted from the leaves of Polygonatum roseum (Liliaceae) in Xinjiang and the primers were designed according to conservative sequences of Polygonatum lectins gene. The complete ORF of Polygonatum roseum agglutinin (PRA) gene was amplified as a fragment of 550 bp, which was identical with predicted size. Like most of the plant lectin genes, there was no intron in the PRA gene. The ORF of the gene encoded 159 amino acid residues, in which included a signal sequence of 28 amino acid residues at its N-terminus. The cDNA sequence had 92% identities compared with the published sequence. The amino acid sequence and SWISS-MODEL analysis indicated that the three-dimensional structure of PRA strongly resembled with that of monocot mannose-binding lectins, which comprised with three antiparallel four-stranded beta-sheets arranged as a 12-stranded beta-barrel. The recombinant pGEX4T-1-PRA and pMAL-p2x-PRA prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed to produce GST-PRA and <e>MBP</e>-PRA fusion proteins in E. coli, respectively. SDS-PAGE of the fusion protein demonstrated that the PRA lectin protein migrated at a size of 14 kD. The immunization was performed by intra-muscular injection of pcDNA3-PRA, and the antiserum was detected by ELISA. Western blotting analysis showed the antiserum specifically bound the lectin protein. The establishment of such an expression system might provide materials for further investigation of the properties and functions of PRA proteins. It also laid the basis for plant genetic engineering on its defensive functions to pests and diseases.",M2

METHODS: The MBP gene mutations in 52 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 62 patients with severe hepatitis B and 64 HBsAg-negative healthy controls were investigated. The mutations in MBP gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: A mutation of MBP gene codon 54 was found. The mutation frequency in the group of severe hepatitis B (35.5%, 22/62) was higher than those in the chronic hepatitis B group (15.4%, 8/52) and the HBsAg-negative healthy controls(14.1%, 9/64), respectively, and their difference was significant (chi-square was 7.79, P&lt; 0.01; chi-square was 5.89,lzP&lt;0.05). The difference between the chronic hepatitis B group and the HBsAg-negative healthy control group was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is only mutation in codon 54 of the MBP gene in patients with hepatitis B infection in the area analyzed. Codon 54 mutation of MBP gene is not related to the persistence of hepatitis B, but it was associated with the progression of hepatitis B infection.",M2
17883369,"Evolution of immunoglobulin and mannose binding protein levels after renal transplantation: association with infectious complications.Hypogammaglobulinemia (hypo-Ig) and low mannose binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) levels might be involved in the infectious risk in renal transplantation. In 152 kidney transplant recipients treated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), during the first year, we prospectively recorded the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia, and low MBP levels. Their influence on infectious complications was evaluated in 92 patients at 3 and 12 months (T3 and T12). The proportion of deficiency increased significantly: hypo-IgG: 6% (T0), 45% (T3), and 30% (T12) (P &lt; 0.001); hypo-MBP: 5%, 11%, and 12% (P = 0.035). Hypo-IgG at T3 was not associated with an increased incidence of first-year infections. A significantly higher proportion of patients with combined hypogammaglobulinemia [IgG+ (IgA and/or IgM)] at T3 and with isolated hypo-IgG at T0 developed infections until T3 compared with patients free of these deficits (P &lt; 0.05). Low MBP levels at T3 were associated with more sepsis and viral infections. Hypogammaglobulinemia is frequent during the first year after renal transplantation in patients treated with a CNI and MMF. Hypo-IgG at T0 and combined Igs deficts at T3 were associated with more infections. MBP deficiency might emerge as an important determinant of the post-transplant infectious risk.",M2
17442667,"Subcellular localization and physiological significance of intracellular mannan-binding protein.Mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a C-type mammalian lectin specific for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine. MBP is mainly synthesized in the liver and occurs naturally in two forms, serum MBP (S-MBP) and intracellular MBP (I-MBP). S-MBP activates complement in association with MBP-associated serine proteases via the lectin pathway. Despite our previous study (Mori, K., Kawasaki, T., and Yamashina, I. (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 232, 223-233), the subcellular localization of I-MBP and its functional implication have not been clarified yet. Here, as an extension of our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the expression of human MBP cDNA reproduces native MBP differentiation of S-MBP and I-MBP in human hepatoma cells. I-MBP shows distinct accumulation in cytoplasmic granules, and is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in COPII vesicle-mediated ER-to-Golgi transport. However, the subcellular localization of either a mutant (C236S/C244S) I-MBP, which lacks carbohydrate-binding activity, or the wild-type I-MBP in tunicamycin-treated cells shows an equally diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that the unique accumulation of I-MBP in the ER and COPII vesicles is mediated by an N-glycan-lectin interaction. Furthermore, the binding of I-MBP with glycoprotein intermediates occurs in the ER, which is carbohydrate- and pH-dependent, and is affected by glucose-trimmed high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. These results strongly indicate that I-MBP may function as a cargo transport lectin facilitating ER-to-Golgi traffic in glycoprotein quality control.",M2

METHODS: 125 pulmonary tuberculosis cases and 198 healthy controls were collected. A case-control study was conducted. Three structural gene mutations in exon 1 of MBP gene (codon 52, codon 54 and codon 57) were studied. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) was carried out in the polymorphism in MBP alleles. Information on related risk factors of tuberculosis was collected, using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted with SPSS software package. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutant heterozygote or homozygote of MBP-52, 54, 57 were 8.0%, 7.2% and 0.4% for cases and 5.3%, 4.3%, 0.5% for controls, respectively. The distribution of mutant genotypes of MBP did not show significant difference between tuberculosis patients and control by Mantel-Haenszel chi2 on sex. The univariate analysis demonstrated that body mass index, marital status, vaccinal vestige, bacillus of Calmette-Guerin vaccine immunization, contacted with pulmonary tuberculosis patients, familial traits were the risk factors of pulmonary tuberculosis. After adjusting those related environmental factors in the multivariate logistic analyses, the total MBP (MBP-52, MBP-54 and MBP-57) and MBP-52 heterozygote genotypes were significantly overrepresented in cases, with adjusted OR (95% CI) being 2.182 (1.058-4.499) and 2.574 (1.028-6.446).

MBP-E-DIII was found both in the soluble as well as the insoluble fraction of the bacterial lysate, while His-E-DIII was found exclusively in the inclusion bodies. These purified proteins were examined in mice for their immunogenicity in presence of an aluminium hydroxide based-adjuvant Alhydrogel and Freund's adjuvant. While both proteins generated anti-JEV antibodies that neutralized JEV activity in vitro, His-E-DIII generated higher antibody titers than MBP-E-DIII.

16595889,"Influence of cholesterol composition on the association of serum mannan-binding proteins with mannosylated liposomes.In our previous studies, serum mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) accelerated the uptake by cultured macrophages. The present study was initiated to investigate the kinetics of molecular interaction between mannosylated liposomes and MBP in more details and the effects of lipid composition on the interaction. The analysis was carried out by surface plasmon spectroscopy (SPR) methods, using rabbit serum MBP isolated by affinity chromatography. In SPR studies, neither conventional liposomes nor galactosylated liposomes indicated any interaction, but each mannosylated liposomes had a high response signal corresponding to molecular interaction with immobilized MBP. Association of mannosylated liposomes to serum MBP was not dependent on the lipid composition, suggesting a diffusion-controlled association. Dissociation of the mannosylated liposomes from serum MBP was extremely slow. DSPC/Chol/Man-C4-Chol (90 : 5 : 5, molar ratio) exhibited a slower dissociation rate than DSPC/Chol/Man-C4-Chol (60 : 35 : 5). Clustering of mannose residues on liposomal surfaces might be important in determining the binding affinity of mannosylated liposomes with MBP.",M2
16505041,"In vitro pathogenicity of Acanthamoeba is associated with the expression of the mannose-binding protein.PURPOSE: To determine whether the expression of Acanthamoeba mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is associated with the pathogenicity of the parasite in vitro. METHODS: Both active trophozoites and dormant cysts of a pathogenic strain of A. castellanii were analyzed for their ability to bind to corneal epithelium, express MBP, and produce a cytopathic effect (CPE) on host cells. In addition, host cell binding, CPE-inducing ability, and MBP expression pattern of trophozoites of four different isolates of Acanthamoeba with various degrees of in vitro pathogenicity were analyzed. Binding assays were performed with radiolabeled parasites; CPE assays were performed with rabbit corneal epithelial cells as host cells; and the expression of MBP was detected by affinity chromatography of parasite extracts on mannose affinity columns and by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: Trophozoites of A. castellanii bound avidly to corneal epithelial cells in a mannose-inhibitable manner, whereas cysts exhibited little binding. The lack of binding of the cysts to host cells was associated with the downregulation of MBP, along with the concomitant loss of CPE. Analysis of trophozoites of five different species of Acanthamoeba exhibiting various degrees of pathogenic potential revealed that the ability of parasites to bind to host cells and produce CPE is directly correlated with the expression of the MBP. Acanthamoeba strains that bound avidly to host cells and produced potent CPE, robustly expressed MBP. In contrast, parasite strains that produced only weak CPE, expressed markedly reduced levels of MBP. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrating that the pathogenic potential of Acanthamoeba directly correlates with the expression level of the MBP in conjunction with our published studies showing that Acanthamoeba MBP is a major virulence protein suggest that the amoeba lectin has the potential to serve as a marker of pathogenicity.",M2

These results led to the hypothesis that LTA may also trigger BD in humans. We investigated the humoral and cellular immune response against LTA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in patients with BD, and compared these responses with those of patients with active chronic oral ulcers (OU) and normal controls. METHODS: Samples were obtained from 12 active BD, 12 inactive BD, 12 active OU and 12 normal controls. Anti-LTA, anti-LPS antibodies levels and the capacity of immune complexes anti-LTA IgG-LTA to activate complement were studied. Exposed mannose residues in anti-LTA IgG were analyzed in the four groups. The interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures after LTA and LPS stimulation was also studied in all groups. RESULTS: The capacity to bind mannan binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) of anti-LTA IgGs was significantly higher in BD and active OU patients relative to normal controls (p &lt; 0.001). However, only active BD patients generated significantly higher levels of C5a than controls (p &lt; 0.0001). The IgGs purified from the sera of BD patients showed a high specificity for LTA from Streptococcus sanguis or Streptococcus faecalis. LTA also stimulates the secretion of IL-8 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from active BD patients. Anti-LPS IgA and IgG titers were significantly higher only in active OU patients relative to normal controls (p &lt; 0.0018). CONCLUSION: These results suggest a mechanism involving LTA from streptococci in the pathogenesis of BD.",M2
16116208,"Mannan-binding protein blocks the activation of metalloproteases meprin alpha and beta.Mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a C-type serum lectin that is known to be a host defense factor involved in innate immunity, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine residues. Although some exogenous MBP ligands have been reported, little is known about its endogenous ligands. In the present study, we found that endogenous MBP ligands are highly expressed in the brush border epithelial cells of kidney-proximal tubules by immunohistochemistry, and both meprin alpha and beta (meprins), as novel endogenous MBP ligands, have been identified through affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Meprins are membrane-bound and secreted zinc metalloproteases extensively glycosylated and highly expressed in kidney and small intestinal epithelial cells, leukocytes, and certain cancer cells. Meprins are capable of cleaving growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and biologically active peptides. Deglycosylation experiments indicated that the MBP ligands on meprins are high mannose- or complex-type N-glycans. The interaction of MBP with meprins resulted in significant decreases in the proteolytic activity and matrix-degrading ability of meprins. Our results suggest that core N-linked oligosaccharides on meprins are associated with the optimal enzymatic activity and that MBP is an important regulator for modulation of the localized meprin proteolytic activity via N-glycan binding. Because meprins are known to be some of the major matrix-degrading metalloproteases in the kidney and intestine, MBP, which functions as a natural and effective inhibitor of meprins, may contribute, as a potential therapeutic target, to tumor progression by facilitating the migration, intravasation, and metastasis of carcinoma cells, and to acute renal failure and inflammatory bowel diseases.",M2
16113295,"Biochemical characterization and functional studies of Acanthamoeba mannose-binding protein.Acanthamoebae produce a painful, sight-threatening corneal infection. The adhesion of parasites to the host cells is a critical first step in the pathogenesis of infection. Subsequent to adhesion, the parasites produce a potent cytopathic effect (CPE) leading to target cell death. Recent studies showing that acanthamoebae express a mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) and that free alpha-mannose (alpha-Man) specifically inhibits the adhesion of parasites to host cells suggest that the MBP plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Acanthamoeba infection by mediating host-parasite interactions. However, direct evidence showing that Acanthamoeba MBP is a virulence protein has been lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that the polyclonal immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies prepared against affinity-purified Acanthamoeba MBP markedly inhibit the adhesion of parasites to host cells. The antibody also inhibited the Acanthamoeba-induced CPE on host cells. In contrast, preimmune IgY did not influence either the adhesion of the parasites to host cells or the amoeba-induced CPE. Using a variety of approaches, including affinity chromatography on an alpha-Man gel, electrophoresis under native and denaturing conditions, biotinylation of cell surface proteins, and immunostaining, it was conclusively established that Acanthamoeba MBP is located on the surface membranes of the parasites. Neutral-sugar analysis and lectin binding experiments using succinylated concanavalin A, a plant lectin with high affinity for mannose, revealed that Acanthamoeba MBP is itself a mannose-containing glycoprotein. N-Glycanase treatment to remove N-linked oligosaccharides shifted the subunit molecular mass of MBP from 130 kDa to 110 kDa. Hexosamine analysis revealed that Acanthamoeba MBP lacks detectable levels of GalNAc, suggesting the absence of O-linked oligosaccharides. In summary, we have characterized Acanthamoeba MBP and have shown that it is a major virulence protein responsible for host-parasite interactions and the parasite-induced target cell destruction.",M2
15961060,"Escherichia coli fusion carrier proteins act as solubilizing agents for recombinant uncoupling protein 1 through interactions with GroEL.Fusing recombinant proteins to highly soluble partners is frequently used to prevent aggregation of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Moreover, co-overexpression of prokaryotic chaperones can increase the amount of properly folded recombinant proteins. To understand the solubility enhancement of fusion proteins, we designed two recombinant proteins composed of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial membrane protein, in fusion with <e>MBP</e> or NusA. We were able to express soluble forms of MBP-UCP1 and NusA-UCP1 despite the high hydrophobicity of UCP1. Furthermore, the yield of soluble fusion proteins depended on co-overexpression of GroEL that catalyzes folding of polypeptides. MBP-UCP1 was expressed in the form of a non-covalent complex with GroEL. MBP-UCP1/GroEL was purified and characterized by dynamic light scattering, gel filtration, and electron microscopy. Our findings suggest that MBP and NusA act as solubilizing agents by forcing the recombinant protein to pass through the bacterial chaperone pathway in the context of fusion protein.",M2
15634673,"Characterization of oligosaccharide ligands expressed on SW1116 cells recognized by mannan-binding protein. A highly fucosylated polylactosamine type N-glycan.Mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a C-type serum lectin and activates complement through the lectin pathway when it binds to ligand sugars such as mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose on microbes. In addition, the vaccinia virus carrying the human MBP gene was shown to exhibit potent growth inhibitory activity toward human colorectal carcinoma, SW1116, cells in nude mice. We have proposed calling this activity MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MDCC) (Ma, Y., Uemura, K., Oka, S., Kozutsumi, Y., Kawasaki, N., and Kawasaki, T. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 371-375). In this study, the MBP ligands on the surface of SW1116 cells were characterized. Initial experiments involving plant lectins and anti-Lewis antibodies as inhibitors of MBP binding to SW1116 cells indicated that fucose plays a crucial role in the interaction. Subsequently, Pronase glycopeptides were prepared from whole cell lysates, and oligosaccharides were liberated by hydrazinolysis. After being tagged by pyridylamination, MBP ligand oligosaccharides were isolated with an MBP affinity column, and then their sequences were determined by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry after permethylation, in combination with endo-beta-galactosidase digestion and chemical defucosylation. The MBP ligands were shown to be large, multiantennary N-glycans carrying a highly fucosylated polylactosamine type structure. At the nonreducing termini, Le(b)/Le(a) or tandem repeats of the Le(a) structure prevail, a substantial proportion of which are attached via internal Le(x) or N-acetyllactosamine units to the trimannosyl core. The structures characterized are unique and distinct from those of other previously reported tumor-specific carbohydrate antigens. It is concluded that MBP requires clusters of tandem repeats of the Le(b)/Le(a) epitope for recognition.",M2
15467404,"Superoxide production from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by human mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>).Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a Ca(2+)-dependent mammalian lectin that plays an important role in innate immunity. In this study, we found that ligand-bound MBP stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to induce cell aggregation and superoxide production. The biological response of PMN to ligand-bound MBP was dose- and time-dependent. The PMN aggregation and superoxide production induced by ligand-bound MBP was blocked completely by pertussis toxin, and partially blocked by a platelet activation factor receptor antagonist, TCV-309. These findings suggest that the ligand-bound MBP stimulates PMN through a putative MBP receptor(s) on PMN.",M2
15354437,"Affinity chromatography with monolithic capillary columns I. Polymethacrylate monoliths with immobilized mannan for the separation of mannose-binding proteins by capillary electrochromatography and nano-scale liquid chromatography.Monolithic capillary columns with surface-immobilized mannan have been introduced for affinity-based micro-column separations by nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). Two kinds of polymethacrylate monoliths were prepared, namely poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate) and poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate-co-[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethyl ammonium chloride) to yield neutral and cationic macroporous polymer, respectively. While neutral monoliths with immobilized mannan were only useful for affinity nano-LC, the cationic monoliths with surface-bound mannan were useful in both affinity nano-LC and affinity CEC. The cationic monoliths allowed a relatively high electro-osmotic flow (EOF) when mannan was immobilized to the epoxy monolith via a positively charged spacer arm, triethylenetetramine. The neutral monoliths exhibited lower permeability under pressure-driven flow (PDF) than the cationic monoliths indicating that the latter had wider flow-through pores than the former. Both types of monoliths with immobilized mannan exhibited strong affinity toward mannose-binding proteins (<e>MBP</e>) such as the plant lectins concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin and a mammalian lectin (e.g. rabbit serum mannose-binding protein). Due to the strong binding affinity, the monoliths with surface bound mannan allowed the injection of large volume of rabbit serum and to isolate in a single run the mannose-binding protein in an amount sufficient to run with it sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), thus demonstrating their capability in  nano-proteomics .",M2
15180092,"The natural history and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis: association of radiographic outcome with process variables, joint motion and immune proteins.OBJECTIVE: The purposes of the present study were: 1) to investigate how the long-term course of outcome and inflammatory variables could be described in individual patients and suitably summarized in groups of patients; 2) to investigate the associations between outcome and inflammatory variables on the basis of the defined summary measures; and 3) to investigate new prognostic aspects of RA by means of frozen sera and DNA specimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period 1966-78, 685 Danish Caucasian patients with RA, classified according to the 1958 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria, were admitted to the Department of Rheumatology of Aarhus University Hospital. For scientific purposes all patients went through the same examination programme, including biochemical variables, clinical evaluation of 68 diarthrodial joints, and radiographic evaluation of 46 diarthrodial joints. Since 1987, data from these patients have been organized in a database. The data are arranged according to onset of disease. This thesis is based on about 600,000 data-points from 257 patients. RESULTS: The thesis is based on six studies. The first study shows that early symptomatic improvement of RA during gold treatment was stable over several years, but when evaluated radiographically, the condition continued to deteriorate. In the second study, six main types of radiographic progression were identified: (a) a rare type with no radiographic progression at all (&lt;1%); (b) a type with a slow or moderate onset, but an increasing progression rate (exponential growth type) (9%); (c) a linear type (30%); (d) a type with a moderate to fast onset, and a stable progression rate (the square root type) (11%); (e) a type with a fast onset, but a later decreasing progression rate (the first order kinetics type) (30%) and (f) a type characterized by slow onset, then acceleration and later deceleration (the sigmoid type) (20%). The fact that there was a systematic progression was used to define a system of radiographic events, which could be used as outcome measures in prediction models of the long-term course of RA. The third study shows that low serum levels of the complement-activating serum lectin, mannan (mannose) binding protein (lectin) (<e>MBP</e> = MBL), are associated with a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p=0.006), joint swelling score (JS score) (p=0.019), limitation of joint motion score (LM score) (p=0.027), and annual increase in radiographic destruction score (R score) (p=0.053). The fourth study demonstrated a highly significant association between summary measures of inflammatory variables and radiographic outcome, as defined in the second study, indicating that the degree of inflammation is important for the development of destructive joint damage in RA. The fifth study showed that MBL-insufficient patients (two defective structural MBL alleles, or one defective allele combined with a low-expression variant of the normal allele) had a relative risk of a severe radiographic event of 3.1 compared with the MBL competent group (p&lt;0.0001). The sixth study showed that the relative risk (RR) of early interleukin (IL)-1alpha auto-antibodies (aAb) positive patients developing serious radiographic joint destruction was significantly lower than for IL-1alpha aAb-negative patients, RR=0.29 (p=0.04). In rheumatoid factor (RF) positive patients RR was only 0.18 (p=0.02). Patients who seroconverted &gt;2 years after the onset of RA showed the most aggressive development of joint erosion, with RR of serious radiographic joint destruction of 2.56 (p=0.048). Other factors investigated in subgroups of the patients were HLA-DR4, chemokine receptor 5 (CCR 5) genotypes. IL-6 aAb, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) aAb, and interferon (IFN)-gamma aAb. About 80% of the patients were HLA-DR4 positive, indicating the importance of HLA-DR4 as a predisposing factor for RA. There was no association between IL-6 aAb and radiographic outcome, or CCR5 genotypes and radiographic outcome. VEGF aAb and IFN-gamma aAb were quantitatively unimportant. CONCLUSION: In spite of a general improvement in single measures of inflammatory variables, and a general deterioration in radiographic outcome of RA, there is a highly significant association between summary measures of inflammatory variables and radiographic outcome. The progression of radiographic damage in RA follows mathematical patterns. A new method of evaluating the long-term radiographic outcome by means of Kaplan-Meier plots is demonstrated. It is shown that MBL and IL-1alpha aAb are predictors of the prognosis of RA and may play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA.",M2
15117936,"Cloning and characterization of a novel mannose-binding protein of Acanthamoeba.Acanthamoebae produce a painful, blinding infection of the cornea. The mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) of Acanthamoeba is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the infection by mediating the adhesion of parasites to the host cells. We describe here the isolation and molecular cloning of Acanthamoeba MBP. The MBP was isolated by chromatography on the mannose affinity gel. Gel filtration experiments revealed that the Acanthamoeba lectin is a approximately 400-kDa protein that is constituted of multiple 130-kDa subunits. Cloning and sequencing experiments indicated that the Acanthamoeba MBP gene is composed of 6 exons and 5 introns that span 3.6 kb of the amoeba genome and that MBP cDNA codes for a precursor protein of 833 amino acids. That the cloned cDNA encodes authentic MBP was demonstrated by showing that: (i). recombinant MBP possesses mannose binding activity, and (ii). polyclonal antibodies prepared against Acanthamoeba MBP bound to the recombinant protein. Sequence analysis revealed that the MBP contains a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Despite extensive BLAST searches using the MBP sequence, no significant matches were retrieved. The most striking feature of the Acanthamoeba MBP sequence is the presence of a cysteine-rich region containing 14 CXCXC motifs within the extracellular domain. In summary, we have isolated, cloned, and characterized a novel MBP from Acanthamoeba. Because the presence of antibodies to MBP in tears provides protection against infection, the availability of the MBP cDNA sequence and rMBP should help develop: (i). a tear-based test to identify individuals who are at risk of developing the keratitis and (ii). strategies to immunize high-risk individuals.",M2
15060079,"Two mechanisms for mannose-binding protein modulation of the activity of its associated serine proteases.Serum mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) neutralizes invading microorganisms by binding to cell surface carbohydrates and activating MBP-associated serine proteases-1, -2, and -3 (MASPs). MASP-2 subsequently cleaves complement components C2 and C4 to activate the complement cascade. To analyze the mechanisms of activation and substrate recognition by MASP-2, zymogen and activated forms have been produced, and MBP.MASP-2 complexes have been created. These preparations have been used to show that MBP modulates MASP-2 activity in two ways. First, MBP stimulates MASP-2 autoactivation by increasing the rate of autocatalysis when MBP.MASP-2 complexes bind to a glycan-coated surface. Second, MBP occludes accessory C4-binding sites on MASP-2 until activation occurs. Once these sites become exposed, MASP-2 binds to C4 while separate structural changes create a functional catalytic site able to cleave C4. Only activated MASP-2 binds to C2, suggesting that this substrate interacts only near the catalytic site and not at accessory sites. MASP-1 cleaves C2 almost as efficiently as MASP-2 does, but it does not cleave C4. Thus MASP-1 probably enhances complement activation triggered by MBP.MASP-2 complexes, but it cannot initiate activation itself.",M2
14724269,"Localization of the serine protease-binding sites in the collagen-like domain of mannose-binding protein: indirect effects of naturally occurring mutations on protease binding and activation.Mutations in the collagen-like domain of serum mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) interfere with the ability of the protein to initiate complement fixation through the MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs). The resulting deficiency in the innate immune response leads to susceptibility to infections. Studies have been undertaken to define the region of MBP that interacts with MASPs and to determine how the naturally occurring mutations affect this interaction. Truncated and modified MBPs and synthetic peptides that represent segments of the collagen-like domain of MBP have been used to demonstrate that MASPs bind on the C-terminal side of the hinge region formed by an interruption in the Gly-X-Y repeat pattern of the collagen-like domain. The binding sites for MASP-2 and for MASP-1 and -3 overlap but are not identical. The two most common naturally occurring mutations in MBP result in substitution of acidic amino acids for glycine residues in Gly-X-Y triplets on the N-terminal side of the hinge. Circular dichroism analysis and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrate that the triple helical structure of the collagen-like domain is largely intact in the mutant proteins, but it is more easily unfolded than in wild-type MBP. Thus, the effect of the mutations is to destabilize the collagen-like domain, indirectly disrupting the binding sites for MASPs. In addition, at least one of the mutations has a further effect on the ability of MBP to activate MASPs.",M2
14666735,"Role of mannan-binding protein, <e>MBP</e>, in innate immunity.Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a C-type lectin, which binds to carbohydrates on the surface of some microorganisms and kills them through the activation of complement. This complement activation pathway is called the lectin pathway. MBP also kills mammalian cells that express MBP ligands on their surfaces via the lectin pathway. Recently, we found anti-tumor activity of MBP in vivo using tumor cells transplanted into nude mice. We propose to call this anti-tumor effect mannan-binding protein-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MDCC), because it does not require complement activation, and the involvement of some immune cells was assumed. Very recently, MBP was demonstrated to be selectively expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine. This finding may suggest that MBP plays an important role in the small intestine as a host defense factor.",M2
12796737,"Pancreatic elastase is proven to be a mannose-binding protein--implications for the systemic response to pancreatitis.BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding proteins (<e>MBPs</e>) have been isolated from serum, liver, lung, and kidney and are believed to play an important role in first-line host defense during acute phase inflammatory response. Because of the inflammatory nature of pancreatitis, we postulate that the pancreas produces endogenous MBP. METHODS: Pancreatic juice, from both human and rat, was collected by pancreatic duct cannulation and subjected to mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography to isolate pancreatic MBP (pMBP). Protein eluates from the mannose-Sepharose column were analyzed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, sodium dodeclysulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and, subsequently, by N-terminal protein sequencing. Western blot analysis was used to identify the pMBP, and reverse transcriptionase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine its mRNA expression. Complement lysis was measured using red blood cells coated with yeast mannan. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA expression in macrophages was measured using RNase protection assay. RESULTS: A 30-kd MBP was isolated from both human and rat pancreatic juice and a rat acinar cell line. Genetic analysis (using RT-PCR with known MBP primers) and protein analysis (using Western blot with a known anti-MBP antibody) suggest that the pMBP is different from any previously described MBP. Protein sequencing analysis of pMBP generated an N-terminus sequence of 12 residues, indicating that pMBP is human pancreatic elastase III. Western blot analysis using an anti-elastase antibody confirms that the pMBP is a pancreatic elastase. Exposure of macrophages to pancreatic elastase resulted in an increased mRNA level of TNF-alpha, a potent proinflammatory cytokine in acute-phase response. Addition of mannan to pancreatic elastase further upregulated the TNF-alpha response. CONCLUSION: We isolated an MBP from the pancreas and identified it as pancreatic elastase. We characterized it as having properties different from that of any previously known MBP. We showed that pMBP or pancreatic elastase is involved in the activation of macrophages, and that this activation is potentiated by mannan. We postulate that the mannose-binding properties of pancreatic elastase identify this enzyme as a candidate catalyst for both pancreatic and systemic inflammation.",M2
12743029,"Crystal structure of the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 region of mannose-binding protein associated serine protease-2.Serum mannose-binding proteins (<e>MBPs</e>) are C-type lectins that recognize cell surface carbohydrate structures on pathogens, and trigger killing of these targets by activating the complement pathway. MBPs circulate as a complex with MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which become activated upon engagement of a target cell surface. The minimal functional unit for complement activation is a MASP homodimer bound to two MBP trimeric subunits. MASPs have a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal CUB domain, a Ca(2+)-binding EGF-like domain, a second CUB domain, two complement control protein modules and a C-terminal serine protease domain. The CUB1-EGF-CUB2 region mediates homodimerization and binding to MBP. The crystal structure of the MASP-2 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 dimer reveals an elongated structure with a prominent concave surface that is proposed to be the MBP-binding site. A model of the full six-domain structure and its interaction with MBPs suggests mechanisms by which binding to a target cell transmits conformational changes from MBP to MASP that allow activation of its protease activity.",M2

12679901,"Current status and prospects of studies on human genetic alleles associated with hepatitis B virus infection.Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can cause a broad spectrum diseases, including from asymptomatic HBV carriers or cryptic hepatitis, to acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, Liver cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The variable pattern and clinical outcome of the infection were mainly determined by virological itself factors, host immunological factors and genetic factors as well as the experimental factors. Among the human genetic factors, major candidate or identified genes involved in the process of HBV infection fall into the following categories: (1) genes that mediate the processes of viral entry into hepatocytes, including genes involved in viral binding, fusion with cellular membrane and transportation in target cells; (2) genes that modulate or control the immune response to HBV infection; (3) genes that participate in the pathological alterations in liver tissue; (4) genes involved in the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic HBV infection, including genes related to mother-to-infant transmission of HBV infection; and (5) those that contribute to resistance to antiviral therapies. Most of the reports of human genes associated with HBV infection have currently focused on HLA associations. For example, some investigators reported the association of the HLA class II alleles such as DRB1*1302 or HLA-DR13 or DQA1*0501-DQB1*0301-DQB1*1102 haplotypes with acute and/or chronic hepatitis B virus infection, respectively. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Th1 cytokines (including IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and TNF-alpha have been identified to participate the process of viral clearance and host immune response to HBV. In contrast, the Th2 cytokine IL-10 serves as a potent inhibitor of Th1 effector cells in HBV diseases. The <e>MBP</e> polymorphisms in its encoding region were found to be involved in chronic infection. Thus, reports from various laboratories have shown some inconsistencies with regard to the effects of host genetic factors on HBV clearance and persistence. Since genetic interactions are complex, it is unlikely that a single allelic variant is responsible for HBV resistance or susceptibility. However, the collective influence of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotype (s) may underlie the natural combinational or synergistic protection against HBV. The future study including the multi-cohort collaboration will be needed to clarify these preliminary associations and identify other potential candidate genes. The ongoing study of the distributions and functions of the implicated allele polymorphisms will not only provide insight into the pathogenesis of HBV infection, but may also provide a novel rationale for new methods of diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.",M2
12471128,"L-<e>MBP</e> is expressed in epithelial cells of mouse small intestine.The mannan-binding proteins (L-MBP and S-MBP, also denoted MBL-C and MBL-A), mainly produced in liver and existing in liver and serum, play important roles in the innate immunity against a variety of pathogens. Total RNA from mouse tissues were screened for MBP mRNA by RT-PCR. In addition to liver, S-MBP mRNA was detected in lung, kidney, and testis, and L-MBP mRNA was detected in kidney, thymus, and small intestine. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of L-MBP. Western blotting with polyclonal Abs against rat L-MBP demonstrated this protein in Triton X-100 extracts of the small intestine obtained from mice that had undergone systemic perfusion. Immunohistochemical staining with an mAb against mouse L-MBP and in situ hybridization revealed that L-MBP is selectively expressed in some villous epithelial cells of the small intestine. These findings suggest that L-MBP plays a role in mucosal innate immunity.",M2
11179331,"Rat mannose-binding protein a binds CD14.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been known to induce inflammation by interacting with CD14, which serves as a receptor for LPS. Mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) belongs to the collectin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, along with surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D. We have recently demonstrated that SP-A modulates LPS-induced cellular responses by interaction with CD14 (H. Sano, H. Sohma, T. Muta, S. Nomura, D. R. Voelker, and Y. Kuroki, J. Immunol. 163:387-395, 2000) and that SP-D also interacts with CD14 (H. Sano, H. Chiba, D. Iwaki, H. Sohma, D. R. Voelker, and Y. Kuroki, J. Biol. Chem. 275:22442-22451, 2000). In this study, we examined whether MBP, a collectin highly homologous to SP-A and SP-D, could bind CD14. Recombinant rat MBP-A bound recombinant human soluble CD14 in a concentration-dependent manner. Its binding was not inhibited in the presence of excess mannose or EDTA. MBP-A bound deglycosylated CD14 treated with N-glycosidase F, neuraminidase, and O-glycosidase, indicating that MBP-A interacts with the peptide portion of CD14. Since LPS was also a ligand for the collectins, we compared the characteristics of binding of MBP-A to LPS with those of binding to CD14. MBP-A bound to lipid A from Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota and rough LPS (S. enterica serovar Minnesota Re595 and Escherichia coli J5, Rc), but not to smooth LPS (E. coli O26:B6 and O111:B4). Unlike CD14 binding, EDTA and excess mannose attenuated the binding of MBP-A to rough LPS. From these results, we conclude that CD14 is a novel ligand for MBP-A and that MBP-A utilizes a different mechanism for CD14 recognition from that for LPS.",M2

We isolated mannose-binding protein A (<e>MBP</e>-A) from rat sera, which is structurally analogous to SP-A, and examined if it was functionally equivalent to SP-A. We found that MBP-A did not possess the ability to interact with lipids and type II cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the SP-A region involved in binding lipids and interacting with type II cells by using chimeric proteins with MBP-A. Chimeras AM1, AM2, and AM3 were constructed with SP-A/MBP splice junctions at Cys218/Gln210, Lys203/Cys195, and Gly194/Glu185, respectively. All of the chimeras bound DPPC and GalCer with activity comparable to recombinant SP-A. The three chimeras retained the ability to induce phospholipid vesicle aggregation and augment lipid uptake by type II cells, albeit to a lesser extent than wild type SP-A. The chimeras inhibited lipid secretion from type II cells with an IC50 of 0.5 microg/mL and competed effectively for SP-A receptor binding. In addition all these chimeras contained the epitope for monoclonal antibody 1D6, which blocks specific SP-A function. From these results, we conclude that the MBP-A region of Glu185-Ala221 can functionally replace the homologous SP-A region of Glu195-Phe228 without loss of interaction with lipids and type II cells.",M2
11196698,"Polymorphisms in the MBL2 promoter correlated with risk of HIV-1 vertical transmission and AIDS progression.We investigated the polymorphisms of the promoter region of the MBL2 gene, which codifies for the Mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>). The study population included 90 children with vertically acquired HIV-infection, further divided on the basis of the disease rate, 27 HIV exposed-uninfected children, and 74 healthy control subjects matched for ethnic origin to evaluate the MBP involvement in the risk of HIV-1 infection and to assess the role of the MBP promoter in AIDS progression. A region of 380 bp in the promoter of the MBL2 gene was analysed by PCR and direct sequencing of both DNA strands. We found that the polymorphism at position -550 influences the risk of HIV-infection and AIDS progression. Also a 6 bp deletion at position -328 was correlated with HIV-1 infection. This study indicates that the promoter of the MBL2 gene influences vertical transmission of HIV and the course of perinatal infection.",M2
8877375,"Characterization of two mannose-binding protein cDNAs from rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta): structure and evolutionary implications.Mannose-binding proteins (<e>MBPs</e>), members of the collectin family, have been implicated as lectin opsonins for various viruses and bacteria. Two distinct but related MBPs, MBP-A and MBP-C, with approximately 55% identity at the amino acid level, have been previously characterized from rodents. In humans, however, only one form of MBP has been characterized. In this paper we report studies elucidating the evolution of primate MBPs. ELISA and Western blot analyses indicated that rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys have two forms of MBP in their sera, while chimpanzees have only one form, similar to humans. Two distinct MBP cDNA clones were isolated and characterized from a rhesus monkey liver cDNA library. Rhesus MBP-A is closely related to the mouse and rat MBP-A, showing 77% and 75% identity at the amino acid level, respectively. Rhesus MBP-A also has three cysteines at the N-terminus, similar to mouse and rat MBP-A and human MBP. Rhesus MBP-C shares 90% identity with the human MBP at the amino acid level and has three cysteines at the N-terminus, in contrast to two cysteine residues found in rodent MBP-C. A stretch of nine amino acids close to the N-terminus, absent in both mouse and rat MBP-A, but present in rodent MBP-C, chicken and human MBPs, is also found in the rhesus MBP-A. The phylogenetic analysis of rhesus and other mammalian MBPs, coupled with the serological data suggest that at least two distinct MBP genes existed prior to mammalian radiation and the hominoid ancestor apparently lost one of these genes or failed to express it.",M2
10589993,"Lectin-carbohydrate interactions: fine specificity difference between two mannose-binding proteins.Two types of rat mannose-binding proteins (<e>MBPs</e>), MBP-A (serum type) and MBP-C (liver type), have similar binding specificity for monosaccharide and similar binding site construct according to the X-ray structure, but exhibit different affinity toward natural oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. To understand the basis for this phenomenon, we used cloned fragment of MBP-A and -C (entire carbohydrate-recognition domain and a short connecting piece) that exists as stable trimers in various binding studies. Binding of a number of mannose-containing di- and tri-saccharides and high-mannose type oligosaccharides indicated that MBP-C has an extended binding area of weak interaction with the second and the third mannose residues, whereas MBP-A recognizes just a single mannose residue. In addition, MBP-C has a weak secondary binding site some 25 A away from the primary site. These findings explain the higher affinity of MBP-C for natural high-mannose type oligosaccharides as compared to MBP-A. A huge affinity differential manifested by natural glycoproteins (e.g., inhibitory potency of thyroglobulin is approximately 200 fold higher for MBP-C than for MBP-A in a solid-phase assay) may be due to steric hindrance experienced by MBP-A in the competition assay, and suggests different arrangement of subunit in the MBP trimers.",M2
9177706,"Efficient immobilization of proteins by modification of plate surface with polystyrene derivatives.Immobilization of proteins on microplate wells by simple adsorption (e.g., for ELISA) is convenient, but it can be inefficient, especially if proteins are hydrophilic or small in size. This problem was alleviated by the use of polyvinylbenzyl lactonoylamide (PVLA). PVLA is strongly adsorbed to the hydrophobic well surface, and its lactonamide part can be oxidized with periodate to generate aldehydo groups. Proteins are then immobilized covalently to the aldehydo groups by reductive amination under mild conditions. Using this method, henceforth termed the PVLA method, alkaline phosphatase (AP) was immobilized to microplates six- to sevenfold greater than by simple adsorption (as measured by activity). Similarly, the activity of immobilized mannose-binding protein A (<e>MBP</e>-A) was 4- to 8-fold higher by the PVLA method than by simple adsorption. The PVLA-coated plates needed as little as 200 ng of MBP-A per well to have a sufficient amount of MBP-A immobilized for the measurement of binding of 125I-labeled mannosylated bovine serum albumin (125I-Man-BSA), but unmodified plates required as much as 20 micrograms/well MBP-A to obtain the same response. Recommended conditions for the PVLA method are 40 microliters of 2 mg/ml of PVLA for coating, 1 mM NaIO4 for the generation of the aldehydo groups, and a 2-h reductive amination at 37 degrees C between pH 8 and 9 for the protein ligation.",M2
7635515,"Mannose binding protein is involved in first-line host defence: evidence from transgenic mice.Mannose binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a calcium-dependent C-type lectin secreted by the liver which seems to be an important component of innate or natural immunity. We have investigated the effects of Candida albicans and thioglycolate injection into transgenic mice bearing the human MBP gene. The transgenes contained a 15 kb fragment of the MBP gene which included the complete coding sequence. Northern blot hybridization showed human MBP mRNA transcripts in the liver of two transgenic lines with low and high copy number respectively. Western blot analysis showed the presence in serum of human MBP which associated into the higher multimeric forms which are capable of activating complement. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) showed that serum human MBP concentrations in the transgenes (1.90 +/- 0.16 mg/l, mean +/- SEM) were about twice as high as the levels in man. The serum concentration of MBP A, which is the mouse homologue of MBP, (13.9 +/- 0.45 mg/l) was about seven times that of human MBP. Intravenous injection of Candida albicans caused the serum human MBP level to fall by more than 50% in the first hour and then slowly recover, but it did not return the initial value by 72 hr. Candida injection caused a 25% fall in serum mouse MBP A in the first hour which then rose to supranormal levels by 72 hr. Following Candida injection mouse MBP A mRNA concentrations increased over 72 hr in contrast to human MBP mRNA which remained constant in both transgenic lines. These data indicate that the human MBP gene fragment in the transgene did not include the regulatory elements of the gene. Total haemolytic complement activity and C3 concentrations also fell immediately after Candida and thioglycolate injection while the concentrations of mannose specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) did not fall. The data indicate that mannose binding protein plays an important role in the initial stages of defence against infection which, in this model, is quantitatively greater than that of mannose-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. Mannose binding protein is probably most important in defense of previously unexposed and non-immune hosts.",M2
7540906,"Comparative modeling of the three-dimensional structure of type II antifreeze protein.Type II antifreeze proteins (AFP), which inhibit the growth of seed ice crystals in the blood of certain fishes (sea raven, herring, and smelt), are the largest known fish AFPs and the only class for which detailed structural information is not yet available. However, a sequence homology has been recognized between these proteins and the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins. The structure of this domain from rat mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>-A) has been solved by X-ray crystallography (Weis WI, Drickamer K, Hendrickson WA, 1992, Nature 360:127-134) and provided the coordinates for constructing the three-dimensional model of the 129-amino acid Type II AFP from sea raven, to which it shows 19% sequence identity. Multiple sequence alignments between Type II AFPs, pancreatic stone protein, MBP-A, and as many as 50 carbohydrate-recognition domain sequences from various lectins were performed to determine reliably aligned sequence regions. Successive molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations were used to relax bond lengths and angles and to identify flexible regions. The derived structure contains two alpha-helices, two beta-sheets, and a high proportion of amino acids in loops and turns. The model is in good agreement with preliminary NMR spectroscopic analyses. It explains the observed differences in calcium binding between sea raven Type II AFP and MBP-A. Furthermore, the model proposes the formation of five disulfide bridges between Cys 7 and Cys 18, Cys 35 and Cys 125, Cys 69 and Cys 100, Cys 89 and Cys 111, and Cys 101 and Cys 117.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
7766991,"Characterization of murine mannose-binding protein genes Mbl1 and Mbl2 reveals features common to other collectin genes.Mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) is a member of a family of collagenous lectins (collectins), which are believed to play an important role in first-line host defense. In this study, the two genes encoding MBP in mice--Mbl1 and Mbl2--have been isolated and their exon-intron structure studied to understand their evolutionary relationship to the single human (MBL) and the two rat MBP genes. Mouse Mbl1 and Mbl2 have five and six exons, respectively. The structure of the mouse Mbl genes is similar to that of the rat and human MBP genes and shows homology to the other collectin genes, with the entire carbohydrate recognition domain being encoded in a single exon and all introns being in phase 1. The MBP encoded by mouse Mbl1 with three cysteines in the first coding exon, like the rat Mbl1 and human MBL, is capable of a higher degree of multimerization and has apparent ability to fix complement in the absence of antibody or C1q. However, the structural features of other exons, that is, the larger size of collagen domain region in the first coding exon (64 bp in Mbl2 vs 46 bp in Mbl1) and the smaller size of the exon encoding the trimerization domain (69 bp in Mbl2 vs 75 bp in Mbl1) reveal that the single human MBL gene is closely related to rodent Mbl2 rather than rodent Mbl1. The findings in this study suggest that in contrast to the evolution of another collectin gene--bovine surfactant protein-D--which duplicated in bovidae after divergence from humans, MBP gene most likely duplicated prior to human-rodent divergence, and that the human homolog to Mbl1 was perhaps lost during evolution.",M2
7515696,"Identification of a bovine serum mannan-binding protein reactive with a Ra chemotype strain of Salmonella serovar typhimurium.To study the relationship between a bovine serum mannan-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) and a serum protein reactive with a Ra chemotype strain of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium (Ra-reactive factor, RaRF), both proteins were isolated by use of their affinity for yeast mannan and the Salmonella cells followed by affinity chromatography on mannobiose-Sepharose 4B. Both purified proteins showed a major protein band with a molecular weight of 33,000 and a few faint bands in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. In Western blotting with rabbit anti-bovine MBP antibody, the major subunit of both proteins were found to be immunologically identical. Similar findings were also obtained with purified human MBP and RaRF. From these findings, bovine and human serum MBP are suggested to be electrophoretically and immunologically the same as their corresponding RaRF.",M2
1637828,"cDNAs and deduced amino acid sequences of subunits in the binding component of mouse bactericidal factor, Ra-reactive factor: similarity to mannose-binding proteins.The complement-dependent bactericidal factor, Ra-reactive factor, binds specifically to Ra polysaccharide, which is common to some strains of Gram-negative enterobacteria, and its is a complex of proteins composed of a polysaccharide-binding component and a component that is presumably responsible for the complement activation. The former component consists of two different 28-kDa polypeptides, P28a and P28b. We determined the partial amino acid sequences of P28a and P28b, and the results indicated that these polypeptides were similar to two species of mannose-binding protein, <e>MBP</e>-C and MBP-A (alternative names, liver and serum mannan-binding proteins, respectively), which have been isolated from rat liver and/or serum [Drickamer, K., Dordal, M. S., &amp; Reynolds, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6878-6887; Oka, S., Itoh, N., Kawasaki, T., &amp; Yamashina, I. (1987) J. Biochem. 101, 135-144]. Thus, we cloned the respective cDNAs, using as probes synthetic oligonucleotides for which the sequences had been deduced from the amino acid sequences of P28a and P28b and of rat MBP cDNAs. The primary structures of P28a and P28b deduced from the cloned cDNAs are homologous to one another. They have three domains, a short NH2-terminal domain, a collagen-like domain, and a domain homologous to regions of some carbohydrate-binding proteins, as has been reported for rat MBPs. Southern and Northern blotting analyses using these cDNAs indicated that the P28a and P28b polypeptides are the products of two unique mouse genes which are expressed in hepatic cells.",M2
1550571,"Human mannose-binding protein is identical to a component of Ra-reactive factor.Human Ra-reactive factor (RaRF) and mannose-binding protein (<e>MBP</e>) were isolated from sera by utilizing their affinity to Ra chemotype Salmonella typhimurium and yeast mannan, respectively. A predominant polypeptide of human RaRF with an Mr of 32 kDa (P32) has the same mobility as human MBP on SDS-PAGE gels. A monoclonal antibody against P32 of human RaRF, 3E7, was found to react not only with P32 but also with human MBP, as assessed by immunoblotting. In addition, 3E7 blocked the complement-activating capacity of human MBP. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of P32 of human RaRF was determined and found to coincide with that of human MBP. Based on these results, it is clear that human MBP is identical to a component of RaRF.",M2
12365732,"The function of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) antibodies under extremes of pH and osmolarity.The ability of anti-<e>MBP</e> Atlantic salmon antibodies to bind to MBP was investigated using ELISA under a range of pHs (3-10) and osmolarities (100-1,000 mOsml(-1)) to determine the optimum binding conditions required for Atlantic salmon antibodies. The pH optimum was between pH 7-8 with pH 7.4 giving the highest level of antibody binding. However, the decrease in optical density was in excess of 60% at pHs 6.0 and 9.0 and in excess of 99% at pHs of 3.0 and 10.0. The optimum osmolarity required for antibody binding was in the range 100-400 mOsml(-1) with 330 mOsml(-1) giving the highest level of antibody binding. Above 400 mOsml(-1) there was a rapid decrease in antibody binding with the OD dropping by over 50% at all dilutions. This decrease was maintained at all osmolarities over 400 mOsml(-1).",M2
3223912,"Purification and characterization of the core-specific lectin from human serum and liver.A lectin that displays specificity for the core region of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (Man3GlcNAc2-Asn) was isolated from human serum and liver by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose. The designation 'core-specific lectin' (CSL) is used to indicate its specificity. Selective elution of human CSL from mannan-Sepharose was accomplished with 50 mM-mannose. Two additional proteins that displayed Ca2+-dependent binding to mannan-Sepharose were eluted by mannose 6-phosphate or beta-glycerophosphate but not by mannose. The latter proteins were identified as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid protein. Human CSL isolated from liver was indistinguishable from serum CSL in its physicochemical properties, immunological properties and specificity. The N-terminal sequence of human CSL is homologous to that reported for 'mannan-binding protein C' (<e>MBP</e>-C) [Drickamer, Dordal &amp; Reynolds (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6878-6887]. The amino acid composition of human CSL is similar to that of rat MBP-C, including the presence of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine residues. Collagen-like sequences with hydroxylated proline and lysine residues appear to be present in human CSL as well as in rat CSL. The collagen-like regions of human and rat CSL may play a role in assembly of CSL subunits into complexes consisting of nine subunits that display Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-binding activity.",M2
