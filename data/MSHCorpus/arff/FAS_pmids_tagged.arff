20219977,"The positive effects of growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 on weight gain and fat mass accrual depend on the insulin/glucose status.Ghrelin and GH secretagogues, including GH-releasing peptide (GHRP)-6, stimulate food intake and adiposity. Because insulin modulates the hypothalamic response to GH secretagogues and acts synergistically with ghrelin on lipogenesis in vitro, we analyzed whether insulin plays a role in the metabolic effects of GHRP-6 in vivo. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats received saline, GHRP-6, insulin, or insulin plus GHRP-6 once daily for 8 wk. Rats receiving saline suffered hyperglycemia, hyperphagia, polydipsia, and weight loss. Insulin, but not GHRP-6, improved these parameters (P &lt; 0.001 for all), as well as the diabetes-induced increase in hypothalamic mRNA levels of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide and decrease in proopiomelanocortin. Cocaine amphetamine-related transcript mRNA levels were also reduced in diabetic rats, with GHRP-6 inducing a further decrease (P &lt; 0.03) and insulin an increase. Diabetic rats receiving insulin plus GHRP-6 gained more weight and had increased epididymal fat mass and serum leptin levels compared with all other groups (P &lt; 0.001). In epididymal adipose tissue, diabetic rats injected with saline had smaller adipocytes (P &lt; 0.001), decreased fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>; P &lt; 0.001), and glucose transporter-4 (P &lt; 0.001) and increased hormone sensitive lipase (P &lt; 0.001) and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma mRNA levels (P &lt; 0.01). Insulin normalized these parameters to control values. GHRP-6 treatment increased FAS and glucose transporter-4 gene expression and potentiated insulin's effect on epididymal fat mass, adipocyte size (P &lt; 0.001), FAS (P &lt; 0.001), and glucose transporter-4 (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, GHRP-6 and insulin exert an additive effect on weight gain and visceral fat mass accrual in diabetic rats, indicating that some of GHRP-6's metabolic effects depend on the insulin/glucose status.",M1
20193134,"High glucose induces differentiation and adipogenesis in porcine muscle satellite cells via mTOR.The present study investigated whether the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway is involved in the regulation of high glucose-induced intramuscular adipogenesis in porcine muscle satellite cells. High glucose (25 mM) dramatically increased intracellular lipid accumulation in cells during the 10-day adipogenic differentiation period. The expressions of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-alpha) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) protein were gradually enhanced during the 10-day duration while mTOR phosphorylation and sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c protein were induced on day 4. Moreover, inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin resulted in a reduction of SREBP-1c protein expression and adipogenesis in cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that the adipogenic differentiation of porcine muscle satellite cells and a succeeding extensive adipogenesis, which is triggered by high glucose, is initiated by the mTOR signal pathway through the activation of SREBP-1c protein. This process is previously uncharacterized and suggests a cellular mechanism may be involved in ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle during type 2 diabetes.",M1
20173758,"Insulin therapy stimulates lipid synthesis and improves endocrine functions of adipocytes in dietary obese C57BL/6 mice.AIM: To evaluate whether insulin intervention could affect the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed on a high-fat-diet for 12-16 weeks to induce insulin resistance. Insulin intervention was administered in the high-fat-diet mice for 4 weeks at 12 weeks (early insulin treatment) or 16 weeks (late insulin treatment). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after insulin treatment. Expression levels of factors involved in the triglyceride synthesis and endocrine functions of adipose tissue including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), aquaporin 7 (AQP7), adiponectin, visfatin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: In the obese mice, glucose tolerance was impaired; triglyceride content was increased in the liver tissue; protein expression of FAS and adiponectin was decreased; expression of visfatin was increased in adipose tissue. After 4-week insulin treatment, glucose tolerance was improved; triglyceride content was decreased in the liver and skeletal muscle; expression of PEPCK-C, FAS, and adiponectin was increased in the adipose tissue; IL-6 and AQP7 expression was reduced in the fat. Early insulin treatment had better effect in increasing the expression of FAS and PEPCK-C and decreasing the expression of IL-6. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that insulin can target adipocytes for improvement of insulin sensitivity through stimulating triglyceride synthesis and partly improving endocrine functions.",M1
20173757,"A mutant of HBx (HBxDelta127) promotes hepatoma cell growth via sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c involving 5-lipoxygenase.AIM: Previously, we identified a natural mutant of hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx) with a deletion from 382 to 401 base pairs (termed HBxDelta127), which could potently enhance growth of hepatoma cells. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of increased hepatoma cell growth that was mediated by HBxDelta127. METHODS: We examined the effect of HBxDelta127 on the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in a model of HepG2-XDelta127 (or H7402-XDelta127) cells, which was stably transfected with HBxDelta127 gene in a human hepatoma HepG2 (or H7402) cell line. RESULTS: Relative to wild type HBx, HBxDelta127 was able to potently activate SREBP-1c at the levels of promoter activity, mRNA and protein by a luciferase reporter gene assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Then, using the treatment with MK886, a specific 5-lipoxygenases (5-LOX) inhibitor, (or 5-LOX siRNA) we identified that 5-LOX was responsible for the upregulation of SREBP-1c by luciferase reporter gene assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Because FAS was a target gene of SREBP-1c, we further showed that HBxDelta127 was able to strongly activate the promoter activity of FAS and upregulated the mRNA expression level of FAS as well, by luciferase reporter gene assay and RT-PCR. In function, flow cytometry analysis revealed that FAS contributed to the growth of hepatoma cells that was mediated by HBxDelta127, using cerulenin (a FAS inhibitor). CONCLUSION: HBxDelta127 promotes hepatoma cell growth through activating SREBP-1c involving 5-LOX.",M1
20148945,"Peptides from purified soybean beta-conglycinin inhibit fatty acid synthase by interaction with the thioesterase catalytic domain.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is uniquely expressed at high levels in cancer cells and adipose tissue. The objectives of this study were to identify, purify and validate soy FAS inhibitory peptides and to predict their binding modes. Soy peptides were isolated from hydrolysates of purified beta-conglycinin by co-immunoprecipitation and identified using LC-MS/MS. Three peptides, KNPQLR, EITPEKNPQLR and RKQEEDEDEEQQRE, inhibited FAS. The biological activity of these peptides was confirmed by their inhibitory activity against purified chicken FAS (IC(50) = 79, 27 and 16 mum, respectively) and a high correlation (r = -0.7) with lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The FAS inhibitory potency of soy peptides also correlated with their molecular mass, pI value and the number of negatively charged and hydrophilic residues. Molecular modeling predicted that the large FAS inhibitory peptides (EITPEKNPQLR and RKQEEDEDEEQQRE) bond to the thioesterase domain of human FAS with lower interaction energies (-442 and -353 kcal.mol(-1), respectively) than classical thioesterase inhibitors (Orlistat, -91 kcal.mol(-1) and C75, -51 kcal.mol(-1)). Docking studies suggested that soy peptides blocked the active site through interactions within the catalytic triad, the interface cavity and the hydrophobic groove in the human FAS thioesterase domain. FAS thioesterase inhibitory activities displayed by the synthetic soy peptides EITPEKNPQLR and RKQEEDEDEEQQRE (IC(50) = 10.1 +/- 1.6 and 10.7 +/- 4.4 mum, respectively) were higher than C75 (58.7 mum) but lower than Orlistat (0.9 mum). This is the first study to identify FAS inhibitory peptides from purified beta-conglycinin hydrolysates and predict their binding modes at the molecular level, leading to their possible use as nutraceuticals.",M1
20126469,"A mutant of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBxDelta127) promotes cell growth through a positive feedback loop involving 5-lipoxygenase and fatty acid synthase.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) contributes to the development of HCC, whereas HBx with COOH-terminal deletion is a frequent event in the HCC tissues. Previously, we identified a natural mutant of HBx-truncated 27 amino acids at the COOH-terminal (termed HBxDelta127), which strongly enhanced cell growth. In the present study, we focused on investigating the mechanism. Accordingly, fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) plays a crucial role in cancer cell survival and proliferation; thus, we examined the signaling pathways involving FAS. Our data showed that HBxDelta127 strongly increased the transcriptional activities of FAS in human hepatoma HepG2 and H7402 cells. Moreover, we found that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) was responsible for the up-regulation of FAS by using MK886 (an inhibitor of 5-LOX) and 5-LOX small interfering RNA. We observed that HBxDelta127 could upregulate 5-LOX through phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 and thus resulted in the increase of released leukotriene B4 (LTB4, a metabolite of 5-LOX) by ELISA. The additional LTB4 could upregulate the expression of FAS in the cells as well. Interestingly, we found that FAS was able to upregulate the expression of 5-LOX in a feedback manner by using cerulenin (an inhibitor of FAS). Collectively, HBxDelta127 promotes cell growth through a positive feedback loop involving 5-LOX and FAS, in which released LTB4 is involved in the up-regulation of FAS. Thus, our finding provides a new insight into the mechanism involving the promotion of cell growth mediated by HBxDelta127.",M1
20074555,"Evaluation of inhibition of fatty acid synthase by ursolic acid: positive cooperation mechanism.The inhibitory effect of ursolic acid (UA) on fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>, EC 2.3.1.85) was investigated. We found that UA potently inhibited the activity of FAS with a half-inhibitory concentration value (IC(50)) of 6.0 microg/ml. The inhibition kinetic results showed that the inhibition of FAS by UA was competitive against acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, but uncompetitive to NADPH. UA at low concentration slowly inactivated FAS, but FAS was fast inactivated by high concentration of UA in a positive cooperative manner. Moreover, NADPH significantly enhanced the inactivation of FAS by low concentration of UA, but NADPH slightly decreased the inactivation of FAS by high concentration of UA. Taken together, the results suggest that ursolic acid decreases the FAS activity through inactivation of acetyl/malonyl transferase. The combination of NADPH and KR domain promotes the inhibitory effect of UA on FAS.",M1
20043266,"The 10t,12c isomer of conjugated linoleic acid inhibits fatty acid synthase expression and enzyme activity in human breast, colon, and prostate cancer cells.The objective of this study was to determine whether downregulation of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) expression and/or inhibition of its activity by the two major CLA isomers, 10t,12c and 9c,11t CLA, could contribute to their inhibitory effect on the growth of human breast (MCF-7), colon (HT-29) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines. We first confirmed and extended the results of others showing that the inhibitory action of CLA on proliferation is dependent on the cell type as well as the structure of the isomer, the 10,12 isomer being a more potent inhibitor than the 9,11 isomer in the concentration range 25-100 microM. By Western analysis, we showed that 10,12 CLA downregulated FAS expression in all of the cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, but the 9,11 isomer had no effect. Both isomers inhibited FAS enzyme activity, but 10,12 CLA was again more potent than the 9,11 isomer. Our results suggest that downregulation of FAS by 10,12 CLA, but not by the 9,11 isomer, as well as inhibition of FAS enzyme activity by both isomers, may contribute to growth inhibition of cancer cells but only at relatively high concentrations.",M1
20021705,"Effect of prebiotic fibre supplementation on hepatic gene expression and serum lipids: a dose-response study in JCR:LA-cp rats.Prebiotic fibres have been proposed to promote weight loss and lower serum cholesterol; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of the present research was to identify possible mechanisms through which prebiotic fibres improve serum lipids. Lean and obese JCR:La-cp rats aged 8 weeks consumed one of three diets supplemented with 0, 10 or 20 % prebiotic fibre for 10 weeks. Rats were anaesthetised and a fasting blood sample was taken for lipid analysis. Real-time PCR was used to determine gene expression for cholesterol and fatty acid regulatory genes in liver tissue. Liver and caecal digesta cholesterol and TAG content were quantified. Both doses of prebiotic fibre lowered serum cholesterol levels by 24 % in the obese hyperlipidaemic rats (P &lt; 0.05). This change was associated with an increase in caecal digesta as well as an up-regulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and bile production. Additionally, there was a 42 % reduction in TAG accumulation in the liver of the obese rats with 10 % prebiotic diet (P &lt; 0.05); however, no change in liver fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). Prebiotic fibres appear to lower cholesterol levels through increased cholesterol excretion in the form of bile and inhibit the accumulation of TAG in the liver through a mechanism unrelated to FAS. These effects appear to be limited to the obese model and particularly the 10 % dose. The present work is significant as it provides insight into the mechanisms of action for prebiotic fibres on lipid metabolism and furthers the development of dietary treatments for hypercholesterolaemia.",M1
19874137,"Inhibitory effects of thioethers on fatty acid synthase and 3T3-L1 cells.Thioethers are the main flavor compounds found in Liliaceae Allium vegetables and have been shown to have beneficial effects against several diseases correlated with metabolic syndrome. The inhibitory effects of six thioethers on fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) were investigated. Dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibitions of FAS by one trisulfide and two disulfides were revealed. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS, IC(50) = 8.37 microM) was the most active of these thioethers. Inhibition kinetics, substrate protection analysis, and stoichiometric assay revealed that DATS interacted with both essential sulfhydryl groups on the acyl-carrier protein and beta-ketoacyl synthase domain of FAS to inactivate the enzyme. The inactivation by DATS represented affinity-labeling kinetics. The active thioethers also inhibited the differentiation and lipid accumulation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and the effect was related to their inhibition of FAS. It is suggested that the inhibition on FAS by thioethers and Allium vegetables is an important factor for their effects against metabolic syndrome.",M1
19848389,"Effects of three different highly purified n-3 series highly unsaturated fatty acids on lipid metabolism in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice.Triglycerides (TG) consisting of highly purified (&gt;97%) n-3 series highly unsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were administered to C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice for 4 weeks by pair-feeding to compare their effects on lipid metabolism and to evaluate the effects of DPA on lipid metabolism. The hepatic TG level and total amount was decreased by treatment with DHA and DPA compared to the control. The efficacy of DPA was greater than that of EPA, but less than that of DHA. In contrast, EPA had the greatest serum TG reducing effect. The hepatic cytosol fraction of the DHA-treated group contained the lowest fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and malic enzyme (ME) activity levels. Furthermore, the DHA-treated group contained the highest serum adiponectin concentrations. These findings indicate that the strong hepatic TG-lowering effect of DHA is due to the suppression of TG synthesis. The same tendencies were observed in DPA-treated mice, and the effect was stronger than that observed in EPA-treated mice, but equivalent to that observed in DHA-treated mice. Based on these results, DPA possesses lipid metabolism-improving effects. The beneficial effects of DPA for lipid metabolism were not superior to those of EPA and DHA, and the effect was always intermediate between those of EPA and DHA.",M1
19782152,"Fine-tuning the lipogenic/lipolytic balance to optimize the metabolic requirements of cancer cell growth: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives.Evolving evidence suggest that metabolic requirements for cell proliferation are identical in all normal and cancer cells. HER2 oncogene-overexpressors, a highly aggressive subtype of human cancer cells, constitute one of the best examples of how malignant cells maximize their ability to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conductive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. HER2-overexpressors optimize their requirements of rapid cancer cell growth by fine-tuning a double [lipogenic/lipolytic]-edged metabolic sword. On the one edge, HER2 oncogene overexpression triggers redundant signaling cascades to ensure that all the major enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis will facilitate aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation for energy production (Warburg effect). HER2 also establishes a positive bidirectional relationship with the key lipogenic enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) that rapidly senses and respond to any disturbance in the flux of lipogenic substrates (e.g. NADPH and acetyl-CoA) and lipogenesis end-products (i.e. palmitate). On the other edge, HER2 overexpression arranges detoxifying mechanisms by upregulating PPARgamma, a well established positive regulator role of adipogenesis and lipid storage in cell types with active lipid metabolism. PPARgamma establishes a lipogenesis/lipolysis joining-point that enables HER2-positive cancer cells to avoid endogenous palmitate toxicity while securing palmitate into fat stores to avoid palmitate feedback on FASN functioning. The ability of HER2 to supercharge lipogenesis (by activating regulatory circuits that activate and fuel the lipogenic enzyme FASN) while averting lipotoxicity (by promoting conversion and storage of excess <e>FAs</e> to triglycerides in a PPARgamma-dependent manner) supports the notion that best adapted cancer phenotypes are addicted to oncogenic lipid metabolism for cell proliferation and survival. It is conceptually attractive to assume that we can crash HER2-driven rapid cell proliferation by inhibiting  motor refueling  (upon blockade of lipogenic enzymes), by losing the  lipolytic brake  (upon blockade of PPARgamma) and/or by sticking the  lipogenic gas pedal  (upon supplementation with dietary FAs).",M1
19781324,"Effect of estrogen on gene expression of fatty acid synthase in periosteum.BACKGROUND: Estrogen deficiency contributes to postmenopausal osteoporosis. Periosteum might be a potential target of estrogen, but the underlying mechanism at gene level is far from being elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between estrogen and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) expression in periosteum. METHODS: Human periosteum cells were cultured in vitro. Expressed genes in the substrated cDNA library were verified using semi-quantitative PCR and real-time PCR. The expression of FAS in periosteum of ovarectomized (OVX) SD rats was investigated. RESULTS: FAS gene was most significantly expressed in the subtracted cDNA library of periosteal cells screened by semi-quantitative PCR. Low FAS expression was verified by real-time PCR in the estrogen exposed human periosteum rather than in the control. The estradiol levels were (20.81 +/- 12.62) pg/ml, (19.64 +/- 4.35) pg/ml and (13.47 +/- 1.84) pg/ml in the sham group, the control, and the OVX group, respectively. The estradiol levels in the OVX group was significantly lower (P = 0.0386). The FAS gene expression in periosteum in the OVX group, sham group, and control group was 3.09 +/- 1.97, 1.33 +/- 0.47 and 1.51 +/- 1.32, respectively. The gene expression in the OVX group was significantly higher (P = 0.0372). CONCLUSION: Estrogen modulates FAS gene expression in in vitro human perisoteum as well as in in vivo rat periosteum.",M1
19733654,"Enhancement in liver SREBP-1c/PPAR-alpha ratio and steatosis in obese patients: correlations with insulin resistance and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid depletion.Sterol receptor element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) mRNA expression was assessed in liver as signaling mechanisms associated with steatosis in obese patients. Liver SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha mRNA (RT-PCR), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a) mRNA (real-time RT-PCR), and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA)(GLC) contents, plasma adiponectin levels (RIA), and insulin resistance (IR) evolution (HOMA) were evaluated in 11 obese patients who underwent subtotal gastrectomy with gastro-jejunal anastomosis in Roux-en-Y and 8 non-obese subjects who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (controls). Liver SREBP-1c and FAS mRNA levels were 33% and 70% higher than control values (P&lt;0.05), respectively, whereas those of PPAR-alpha and CPT-1a were 16% and 65% lower (P&lt;0.05), respectively, with a significant 62% enhancement in the SREBP-1c/PPAR-alpha ratio. Liver n-3 LCPUFA levels were 53% lower in obese patients who also showed IR and hipoadiponectinemia over controls (P&lt;0.05). IR negatively correlated with both the hepatic content of n-3 LCPUFA (r=-0.55; P&lt;0.01) and the plasma levels of adiponectin (r=-0.62; P&lt;0.005). Liver SREBP-1c/PPAR-alpha ratio and n-3 LCPUFA showed a negative correlation (r=-0.48; P&lt;0.02) and positive associations with either HOMA (r=0.75; P&lt;0.0001) or serum insulin levels (r=0.69; P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, liver up-regulation of SREBP-1c and down-regulation of PPAR-alpha occur in obese patients, with enhancement in the SREBP-1c/PPAR-alpha ratio associated with n-3 LCPUFA depletion and IR, a condition that may favor lipogenesis over FA oxidation thereby leading to steatosis.",M1
19723916,"Serum fatty acid synthase as a marker of pancreatic neoplasia.Markers of early pancreatic cancer and its precursors are needed to improve the uniformly poor prognosis of this disease. Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and is overexpressed in most human solid tumors. We therefore evaluated serum FAS as a marker of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. FAS expression patterns in primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), and chronic pancreatitis tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Serum FAS levels were determined by ELISA in 102 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas, in 42 patients with IPMNs, in 27 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and in 39 healthy control subjects. FAS protein was overexpressed in the ductal epithelium of 343 of 399 primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas (86.0%) and 28 of 30 IPMNs (93.3%), and in the islet and ductal cells in 3 of 54 chronic pancreatitis tissues (5.6%), whereas normal ductal epithelium lacked FAS expression. Serum FAS levels were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (first quartile median, 22.0; 4.5 ng/mL), in patients with IPMNs (20.7; 9.4 ng/mL), and in patients with chronic pancreatitis (31.1; 11.9 ng/mL) than in healthy controls (0; 0 ng/mL). FAS levels declined postoperatively in 8 of 9 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and elevations of their preoperative serum FAS. In conclusion, serum FAS levels are elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer and IPMNs and are associated with neoplastic overexpression of FAS.",M1
19721252,"Synthesis and biological activity of enantiomeric pairs of 5-(Alk-2-enyl)thiolactomycin and 5-[(E)-Cycloalk-2-enylidenemethyl]thiolactomycin congeners.The title compounds were synthesized by the efficient route previously explored for the synthesis of enantiomeric pairs of thiolactomycin and its 3-demethyl derivative. These studies were carried out to prove the flexibility of the previously explored synthetic route to natural thiolactomycin (TLM) 1 and to examine the structure-activity relationship on the 5-position of 1. While all of the synthesized congeners lacked in vitro antibacterial activity, these studies led us to find 5-(alk-2-enyl)-TLM (ent-4d) which exhibits mammalian type I fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) inhibitory activity equal to that of C75, a potent inhibitor reported previously. It was also found that 5-[(E)-cycloalk-2-enylidenemethyl]-TLM (ent-5c) exhibited slightly less potent mammalian type I FAS inhibitory activity than C75.",M1
19706691,"Transcription profiling and regulation of fat metabolism genes in diapausing adults of the mosquito Culex pipiens.Culex pipiens, the mosquito that vectors West Nile virus in North America, overwinters in an adult diapause (dormancy) that is programmed by the short day length and low temperatures of autumn. In response to these environmental signals, females cease feeding on blood and instead seek sources of nectar used to generate the huge lipid reserves required for winter survival. To identify regulatory networks that regulate fat accumulation and fat consumption during diapause, we compared expression of fat-related genes from nondiapausing females with expression of those same genes in early and late diapause and at diapause termination. Among the 31 genes we examined, 4 were expressed more highly in early diapause than in nondiapause, while 14 genes were downregulated in early diapause. In the transition from early to late diapause, 19 genes related to fat metabolism were upregulated. As reported previously, fatty acid synthase, identified as <e>fas</e>-1 in this study, was upregulated in early diapause. Numerous fat metabolism genes, including multiple kinetic classes and genes involved in beta-oxidation, an energy-generation step, were suppressed in early diapause but were highly expressed in late diapause and at diapause termination. RNA interference (RNAi) analysis revealed that the fas-1 gene and others (fas-3 and fabp) have important roles in fat storage during early diapause. When expression of these genes is suppressed, female mosquitoes fail to sequester the lipids needed for overwintering.",M1
19679086,"Multimeric options for the auto-activation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae <e>FAS</e> type I megasynthase.The fungal type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a 2.6 MDa multienzyme complex, catalyzing all necessary steps for the synthesis of long acyl chains. To be catalytically competent, the FAS must be activated by a posttranslational modification of the central acyl carrier domain (ACP) by an intrinsic phosphopantetheine transferase (PPT). However, recent X-ray structures of the fungal FAS revealed a barrel-shaped architecture, with PPT located at the outside of the barrel wall, spatially separated from the ACP caged in the inner volume. This separation indicated that the activation has to proceed before the assembly to the mature complex, in a conformation where the ACP and PPT domains can meet. To gain insight into the auto-activation reaction and also into the fungal FAS assembly pathway, we structurally and functionally characterized the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS type I PPT as part of the multienzyme protein and as an isolated domain.",M1
19621387,"Sp1 coordinately regulates de novo lipogenesis and proliferation in cancer cells.Cancers express high levels of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) from which they derive fatty acids for membrane biosynthesis to sustain cell proliferation. How cancer cells coordinate de novo lipogenesis and proliferation has not been investigated. Transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are overexpressed in a variety of cancers and regulate gene expression by interacting with GC-rich Sp1 binding sites. Genes encoding FAS and cell cycle proteins such as CDC25A contain Sp1 binding sites in their promoters. We demonstrate by RNA interference that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 all play a role in regulating CDC25A expression and proliferation in human breast cancer cells. Only Sp1, however, also regulates FAS. Furthermore, mithramycin, which blocks Sp1 binding sites, decreased proliferation, inhibited CDC25A and FAS expression and reduced binding of Sp1 to the promoters of these genes as assessed by ChIP assays. Conversely, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) increased proliferation and CDC25A and FAS expression along with increased binding of Sp1 to the promoters of the 2 genes. In addition, we showed that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), the only transcription factor that has been shown to regulate genes of lipogenic enzymes in cancer cells, is also regulated by Sp1. Finally, we demonstrated that Sp1 plays a role in sustaining proliferation and FAS expression in colon as well as prostate cancer cells. Overall, these observations suggest that Sp1 coordinately regulates de novo lipogenesis and proliferation in cancer cells.",M1
19603404,"Protein hydrolysates from beta-conglycinin enriched soybean genotypes inhibit lipid accumulation and inflammation in vitro.Obesity is a worldwide health concern and a well recognized predictor of premature mortality associated with a state of chronic inflammation. The objective was to evaluate the effect of soy protein hydrolysates (SPH) produced from different soybean genotypes by alcalase (SAH) or simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGIH) on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The anti-inflammatory effect of SPH produced by alcalase on LPS-induced macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line was also investigated. SAH (100 microM) derived from soybean enriched in beta-conglycinin (BC) (up to 47% total protein) decreased lipid accumulation (33-37% inhibition) through downregulation of gene expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). SGIH (100 microM) inhibited lipid accumulation to a lesser extent (8-14% inhibition) through inhibition of LPL gene expression. SAH (5 microM) decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO) (18-35%) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) (47-71%) and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (31-53%) and cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) (30-52%). This is the first investigation showing that soy hydrolysates inhibit LPS-induced iNOS/NO and COX-2/PGE(2 )pathways in macrophages. Soybeans enriched in BCs can provide hydrolysates that limit fat accumulation in fat cells and inflammatory pathways in vitro and therefore warrant further studies as a healthful food.",M1
19571038,"17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 8 and carbonyl reductase type 4 assemble as a ketoacyl reductase of human mitochondrial <e>FAS</e>.Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (FAS) generates the octanoyl-group that is required for the synthesis of lipoic acid and is linked to mitochondrial RNA metabolism. All of the human enzymes involved in mitochondrial FAS have been characterized except for beta-ketoacyl thioester reductase (HsKAR), which catalyzes the second step in the pathway. We report here the unexpected finding that a heterotetramer composed of human 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 8 (Hs17beta-HSD8) and human carbonyl reductase type 4 (HsCBR4) forms the long-sought HsKAR. Both proteins share sequence similarities to the yeast 3-oxoacyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase (Oar1p) and the bacterial FabG, although HsKAR is NADH dependent, whereas FabG and Oar1p are NADPH dependent. Hs17beta-HSD8 and HsCBR4 show a strong genetic interaction in vivo in yeast, where, only if they are expressed together, they rescue the respiratory deficiency and restore the lipoic acid content of oar1Delta cells. Moreover, these two proteins display a stable physical interaction and form an active heterotetramer. Both Hs17beta-HSD8 and HsCBR4 are targeted to mitochondria in vivo in cultured HeLa cells. Notably, 17beta-HSD8 was previously classified as a steroid-metabolizing enzyme, but our data suggest that 17beta-HSD8 is primarily involved in mitochondrial FAS.",M1
19555075,"Structure and malonyl CoA-ACP transacylase binding of streptomyces coelicolor fatty acid synthase acyl carrier protein.Malonylation of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) by malonyl Coenzyme A-ACP transacylase (MCAT) is fundamental to bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we report the structure of the Steptomyces coelicolor (Sc) fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) ACP and studies of its binding to MCAT. The carrier protein adopts an alpha-helical bundle structure common to other known carrier proteins. The Sc FAS ACP shows close structural homology with other fatty acid ACPs and less similarity with Sc actinorhodin (act) polyketide synthase (PKS) ACP where the orientation of helix I differs. NMR experiments were used to map the binding of ACP to MCAT. This data suggests that Sc FAS ACP interacts with MCAT through the negatively charged helix II of ACP, consistent with proposed models for ACP recognition by other FAS enzymes. Differential roles for residues at the interface are demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro assays. MCAT has been suggested, moreover, to participate in bacterial polyketide synthesis in vivo. We demonstrate that the affinity of the polyketide synthase ACP for MCAT is lower than that of the FAS ACP. Mutagenesis of homologous helix II residues on the polyketide synthase ACP suggests that the PKS ACP may bind to MCAT in a different manner than the FAS counterpart.",M1
19551180,"The chemical biology of modular biosynthetic enzymes.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), polyketide synthase (PKS), and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) modular biosynthetic enzymes are responsible for the production of a multitude of structurally diverse and biologically important small molecule natural products. Traditional biochemical and genetic studies of these enzymes have contributed substantially to the understanding of their underlying biosynthetic mechanisms. More recently these investigations have been aided by the skillful application of a combination of chemical and biological techniques to aid in overcoming the unique challenges associated with the enzymology of these large multifunctional enzymes. This critical review provides a historical context and details studies (through July 2008) which aim to identify and characterize these enzymes using synthetically and/or chemoenzymatically generated small molecule probes (233 references).",M1
19550039,"Cloning and sequence analysis of putative type II fatty acid synthase genes from Arachis hypogaea L.The cultivated peanut is a valuable source of dietary oil and ranks fifth among the world oil crops. Plant fatty acid biosynthesis is catalysed by type II fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in plastids and mitochondria. By constructing a full-length cDNA library derived from immature peanut seeds and homology-based cloning, candidate genes of acyl carrier protein (ACP), malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (I, II, III), beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase and enoyl-ACP reductase were isolated. Sequence alignments revealed that primary structures of type II FAS enzymes were highly conserved in higher plants and the catalytic residues were strictly conserved in Escherichia coli and higher plants. Homologue numbers of each type II FAS gene expressing in developing peanut seeds varied from 1 in KASII, KASIII and HD to 5 in ENR. The number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was quite different in each gene. Peanut type II FAS genes were predicted to target plastids except ACP2 and ACP3. The results suggested that peanut may contain two type II FAS systems in plastids and mitochondria. The type II FAS enzymes in higher plants may have similar functions as those in E. coli.",M1
19543323,"Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase inhibition is selectively cytotoxic to human breast cancer cells.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) inhibition initiates selective apoptosis of cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro, which may involve malonyl-CoA metabolism. These findings have led to the exploration of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) as a potential novel target for cancer treatment. MCD regulates the levels of cellular malonyl-CoA through the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is both a substrate for FAS and an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation acting as a metabolic switch between anabolic fatty acid synthesis and catabolic fatty acid oxidation. We now report that the treatment of human breast cancer (MCF7) cells with MCD small interference RNA (siRNA) reduces MCD expression and activity, reduces adenosine triphosphate levels, and is cytotoxic to MCF7 cells, but not to human fibroblasts. In addition, we synthesized a small-molecule inhibitor of MCD, 5-{(Morpholine-4-carbonyl)-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-trifluoromethyl-ethyl)-phenyl]-amino}-pentanoic acid methyl ester (MPA). Similar to MCD siRNA, MPA inhibits MCD activity in MCF7 cells, increases cellular malonyl-CoA levels and is cytotoxic to a number of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that MCD-induced cytotoxicity is likely mediated through malonyl-CoA metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that MCD is a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.",M1
19543203,"The gene expression of the main lipogenic enzymes is downregulated in visceral adipose tissue of obese subjects.Contradictory findings regarding the gene expression of the main lipogenic enzymes in human adipose tissue depots have been reported. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and acetyl-CoA carboxilase (ACC) in omental and subcutaneous (SC) fat depots from subjects who varied widely in terms of body fat mass. FAS and ACC gene expression were evaluated by real time-PCR in 188 samples of visceral adipose tissue which were obtained during elective surgical procedures in 119 women and 69 men. Decreased sex-adjusted FAS (-59%) and ACC (-49%) mRNA were found in visceral adipose tissue from obese subjects, with and without diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2), compared with lean subjects (both P &lt; 0.0001). FAS mRNA was also decreased (-40%) in fat depots from overweight subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Indeed, FAS mRNA was significantly and positively associated with ACC gene expression (r = 0.316, P &lt; 0.0001) and negatively with BMI (r = -0.274), waist circumference (r = -0.437), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.310), serum glucose (r = -0.277), and fasting triglycerides (r = -0.226), among others (all P &lt; 0.0001). Similar associations were observed for ACC gene expression levels. In a representative subgroup of nonobese (n = 4) and obese women (n = 6), relative FAS gene expression levels significantly correlated (r = 0.657, P = 0.034; n = 10) with FAS protein values. FAS protein levels were also inversely correlated with blood glucose (r = -0.640, P = 0.046) and fasting triglycerides (r = -0.832, P = 0.010). In conclusion, the gene expression of the main lipogenic enzymes is downregulated in visceral adipose tissue from obese subjects.",M1
19538638,"Subcellular distribution of key enzymes of lipid metabolism during the euthermia-hibernation-arousal cycle.Mammalian hibernation is a natural, fully reversible hypometabolic state characterized by a drastic reduction of body temperature and metabolic activity, which ensures survival to many species under adverse environmental conditions. During hibernation, many hibernators rely for energy supply almost exclusively on lipid reserves; the shift from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism implies profound rearrangement of the anabolic and catabolic pathways of energetic substrates. However, the structural counterpart of such adaptation is not known. In this study we investigated, by using immunoelectron microscopy, the fine intracellular distribution of two key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, namely, the fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL), in hepatocytes of euthermic, hibernating and arousing hazel dormice. Our results show that the two enzymes are differentially distributed in cellular compartments (cytoplasm, mitochondria and cell nuclei) of hepatocytes during euthermia. Quantitative redistribution of both enzymes among cellular compartments takes place during hibernation and arousal, in accordance with the physiological changes. Interestingly, this redistribution follows different seasonal patterns in cytoplasm, mitochondria and nuclei. In conclusion, our data represent the first quantitative morphological evidence of lipid enzyme distribution in a true hibernator throughout the year cycle, thus providing a structural framework to biochemical changes associated with the hypometabolism of hibernation.",M1
19531664,"A simplified scintillation proximity assay for fatty acid synthase activity: development and comparison with other <e>FAS</e> activity assays.Fatty acid synthase (FAS), an essential enzyme for de novo lipogenesis, has been implicated in a number of disease states, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and cancer. To identify small-molecule inhibitors of FAS, the authors developed a bead-based scintillation proximity assay (SPA) to detect the fatty acid products of FAS enzymatic activity. This homogeneous SPA assay discriminates between a radiolabeled hydrophilic substrate of FAS (acetyl-coenzyme A) and the labeled lipophilic products of FAS (fatty acids), generating signal only when labeled fatty acids are present. The assay requires a single addition of unmodified polystyrene imaging SPA beads and can be miniaturized to 384- or 1536-well density with appropriate assay statistics for high-throughput screening. High-potency FAS inhibitors were used to compare the sensitivity of the SPA bead assay with previously described assays that measure FAS reaction intermediates (CoA-SH and NADP+). The advantages and disadvantages of these different FAS assays in small-molecule inhibitor discovery are discussed.",M1
19526720,"The fatty acid synthase of the basidiomycete Omphalotus olearius is a single polypeptide.Fatty acids are essential components of almost all biological membranes. Additionally, they are important in energy storage, as second messengers during signal transduction, and in post-translational protein modification. De novo synthesis of fatty acids is essential for almost all organisms, and entails the iterative elongation of the growing fatty acid chain through a set of reactions conserved in all kingdoms. During our work on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, a 450-kDa protein was detected by SDS-PAGE of enriched fractions from mycelial lysates from the basidiomycete Omphalotus olearius. Protein sequencing of this protein band revealed the presence of peptides with homology to both alpha and beta subunits of the ascomycete fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) family. The FAS encoding gene of O. olearius was sequenced. The positions of its predicted 21 introns were verified. The gene encodes a 3931 amino acids single protein, with an equivalent of the ascomycetous beta subunit at the N-terminus and the a subunit at the C-terminus. This is the first report on an FAS protein from a homobasidiomycete and also the first fungal FAS which is comprised of a single polypeptide.",M1
19497957,"LXRalpha activation perturbs hepatic insulin signaling and stimulates production of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins.Liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha) is considered a master regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism; however, little is known about the link between LXR activation, hepatic insulin signaling, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apolipoprotein B (apoB) assembly and secretion. Here, we examined the effect of LXRalpha activation on hepatic insulin signaling and apoB-lipoprotein production. In vivo activation of LXRalpha for 7 days using a synthetic LXR agonist, TO901317, in hamsters led to increased plasma triglyceride (TG; 3.6-fold compared with vehicle-treated controls, P = 0.006), apoB (54%, P &lt; 0.0001), and VLDL-TG (eightfold increase compared with vehicle). As expected, LXR stimulation activated maturation of sterol response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) as well as the SREBP-1c target genes steroyl CoA desaturase (SCD) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). Metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments in primary hamster hepatocytes showed increased stability and secretion of newly synthesized apoB following LXR activation. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) mRNA and protein were unchanged, however, likely because of the relatively short period of treatment and long half-life of MTP mRNA. Examination of hepatic insulin-signaling molecules revealed LXR-mediated reductions in insulin receptor (IR)beta subunit mass (39%, P = 0.014) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (24%, P = 0.023), as well as increases in protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B (29%, P &lt; 0.001) protein mass. In contrast to IRS-1, a twofold increase in IRS-2 mass (228%, P = 0.0037) and a threefold increase in IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (321%, P = 0.012) were observed. In conclusion, LXR activation dysregulates hepatic insulin signaling and leads to a considerable increase in the number of circulating TG-rich VLDL-apoB particles, likely due to enhanced hepatic assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins.",M1
19471962,"Evaluation of fatty acid synthase expression in oesophageal mucosa of patients with oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND AND AIM: To evaluate the expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in the oesophagitis-Barrett's oesophagus-oesophageal adenocarcinoma sequence compared with p53 and Ki67 expressions, retained for a long time reliable markers of oesophageal cells biological behaviour. METHODS: In Barrett's oesophagus, oesophagitis and oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients, biopsies were taken from pathologic sites of the mucosa for histological and immuno-histochemical detection of FAS, p53 and Ki67. FAS expression was positive, when a strong granular cytoplasmic staining was observed in oesophageal cells. Ki67 and p53 was defined positive, when nuclear staining was clearly detected at 10x magnification. RESULTS: A mild expression of FAS was found in 39% of patients with oesophagitis. The amount of FAS expression increased up to 70% in Barrett's oesophagus while this was present in all patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (p = 0.0001). In Barrett's oesophagus, p53 was mildly or intensely expressed in 77% and in 15% of cases, respectively, and mildly or intensely expressed in 33% and 67% of patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, respectively, (p = 0.0001). Ki67 was mildly expressed in 17% of oesophagitis cases and was absent in the majority of cases. In Barrett's oesophagus, a mild Ki67 expression was present in 46% of cases, and in oesophageal adenocarcinoma it was present prevalently in intense form (67%; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The over-expression of p53, Ki67 and FAS in otherwise similar morphological groups may be useful to stratify patients into selected prognostic subgroups in order to achieve better clinical approaches.",M1
19418221,"Developmental profiles of lipogenic enzymes and their regulators in the neonatal mouse brain.It has been shown that lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), are highly expressed in the rodent brain during the early neonatal period and decline thereafter. However, cellular localization of these enzymes is unknown. Presently, we examined developmental changes in the levels and cellular localization of FAS and ACC, and their putative regulators, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the mouse brain. Levels of these proteins including phosphorylated forms of ACC and AMPK decreased between postnatal day 4 (P4) and P19. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that FAS, ACC, AMPK, and SREBP-1 were expressed in neurons at P7, while FAS was found mostly in cells of oligodendrocyte lineage at P19. These studies suggest that neurons in the early neonatal brain are involved in do novo fatty acid synthesis.",M1
19409434,"Ghrelin modulates fatty acid synthase and related transcription factor mRNA levels in a tissue-specific manner in neonatal broiler chicks.The endogenous ligand for the growth hormone (GH) secretagogue receptor ghrelin is a peptide secreted by the stomach of mammals and stimulates food intake and enhances adiposity. In avian species, ghrelin is mainly produced by the proventriculus but reduces food intake whereas its effect on lipogenesis in different tissues is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of a single intravenous injection of 2.8 microg (1 nmol per chick) recombinant chicken ghrelin in neonatal broiler chicks. Besides food intake and plasma corticosterone levels, mRNA levels of the key lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and its related transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) were determined in diencephalon, liver and quadriceps femoris muscle before, and 15, 30, and 60 min after injection. Chicken ghrelin administration induced a significant short-term (&lt;30 min) reduction in food intake and markedly elevated plasma corticosterone levels. In diencephalon, FAS, SREBP-1 and PPARgamma mRNA levels were significantly increased within 15 min after ghrelin injection. These observations suggest that central fatty acid metabolism is involved in the anorectic effects of ghrelin. In contrast, hepatic mRNA levels of FAS and both transcription factors were significantly reduced within 30 min after ghrelin injection. In muscle, FAS and transcription factor gene expression was very low and not affected by ghrelin. Overall, our results indicate that ghrelin has opposite effects on FAS and transcription factor mRNA amounts with increased levels in diencephalon (central anorectic effect) and decreased levels in liver (peripheral anti-lipogenic effect) in chickens.",M1
19393339,"Increased de novo lipogenesis in liver contributes to the augmented fat deposition in dexamethasone exposed broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus).Effect of dexamethasone (DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid) on lipid metabolism in broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) was investigated. Male Arbor Acres chickens (1 wk old, n=30) were injected with DEX or saline for 1 wk, and a pair-fed group was included. DEX administration resulted in enhanced lipid deposition in adipose tissues. Plasma insulin increased about 3.3 fold in DEX injected chickens as against the control and hepatic triglyceride was higher as compared with the pair-fed chickens. In DEX injected chickens, the hepatic activities of malic enzyme (ME) and fatty acid synthetase (<e>FAS</e>) were significantly increased, while the mRNA levels of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), ME, and FAS were significantly up-regulated, compared with the control. Although the mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) genes in adipose tissue were not affected by DEX injection, ME activity and mRNA levels in abdominal fat pad of chickens treated with DEX are higher than those of control chickens. The results indicated that the increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and in turn, the increased circulating lipid flux contributes to the augmented fat deposition in adipose tissues and liver in DEX-challenged chickens. The results suggest that glucocorticoids together with the induced hyperinsulinemia should be responsible for the up-regulated hepatic lipogenesis.",M1
19383549,"The effect of feed restriction on expression of hepatic lipogenic genes in broiler chickens and the function of SREBP1.To study the role of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) in lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis in the chicken, two experiments were carried out. In the first study, seven-week-old broilers (n=16) were allocated into 2 groups, fasted for 24 h or refed for 5 h after a 24 h fasting. The mRNA concentrations for SREBPs and other lipogenic genes in the liver were determined by quantitative real time PCR. The hepatic mRNA relative abundance of lipogenic genes and genes involved in cholesterol synthesis were significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) in the refed broilers. Similar results were demonstrated with Northern analysis. The data suggest that in the liver of fasted broilers, genes associated with lipogenesis and cholesterol biosynthesis were inhibited. Indeed, the mRNA concentrations for fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), malic enzyme, and stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase were almost undetectable after the 24 h fasting. The data also demonstrated that the expression of lipogenic genes coordinate well as a group during the refeeding period. Second, three small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides against SREBP1 were designed to be used in transfecting a chicken hepatocarcinoma cell line LMH. One of the three siRNAs effectively reduced SREBP1 mRNA concentration (p&lt;0.01). The acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase(alpha) (ACC(alpha)) mRNA was also significantly reduced by the SREBP1 siRNA treatment, suggesting that SREBP1 can upregulate the expression of this lipogenic gene. This siRNA, however, did not affect the mRNA for FAS. Taken together, the RNA interference study showed that SREBP1 has the ability to regulate the expression of ACC(alpha). This study has helped us understand more about the function of SREBP1 and the physiology of the broiler chickens.",M1
19381703,"Inhibition of fatty acid synthase by Orlistat accelerates gastric tumor cell apoptosis in culture and increases survival rates in gastric tumor bearing mice in vivo.Orlistat, an anti-obesity drug, is a potent inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and tumor cell viability. It can also induce apoptotic cancer cell death. We examined the effects of Orlistat on cultured NUGC-3 gastric cancer cells. We identified that inhibition of FAS via Orlistat exposure results in rapid cellular damage preceded by a direct but short-lived autophagic response. The Orlistat induced damage can be reversed through the addition of lipid containing media in a process that normally leads to cell death. By limiting exogenous lipid availability and inhibiting FAS using Orlistat, we demonstrated both a greater sensitivity and amplified cancer cell death by activation of apoptosis. We have identified  windows of opportunity  at which time apoptosis can be aborted and cells can be reversed from the death pathway. However, when challenged beyond the window of recovery, cell death becomes all but certain as the ability to be rescued decreases considerably. In vivo examination of Orlistat's ability to inhibit gastrointestinal cancer was examined using heterozygous male C57BL/6J APC-Min mice, which spontaneously develop a fatal gastrointestinal cancer. Mice were fed either a high fat (11%) or low fat (1.2%) diet containing no Orlistat or 0.5 mg Orlistat/g of chow. Orlistat treated mice fed the high fat, but not low fat diet, survived 7-10% longer than the untreated controls.",M1
19360009,"Obesity is accompanied by disturbances in peripheral glucocorticoid metabolism and changes in FA recycling.The glucocorticoid activating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1) is of major interest in obesity-related morbidity. Alterations in tissue-specific cortisol levels may influence lipogenetic and gluco/glyceroneogenetic pathways in fat and liver. We analyzed the expression and activity of 11betaHSD1 as well as the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in adipose and liver and investigated putative associations between 11betaHSD1 and energy metabolism genes. A total of 33 obese women (mean BMI 44.6) undergoing gastric bypass surgery were enrolled. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), omental fat (omental adipose tissue (OmAT)), and liver biopsies were collected during the surgery. 11betaHSD1 gene expression was higher in SAT vs. OmAT (P = 0.013), whereas the activity was higher in OmAT (P = 0.009). The SAT 11betaHSD1 correlated with waist circumference (P = 0.045) and was an independent predictor for the OmAT area in a linear regression model. Energy metabolism genes had AT depot-specific expression; higher leptin and SREBP in SAT than OmAT, but higher PEPCK in OmAT than SAT. The expression of 11betaHSD1 correlated with PEPCK in both AT depots (P = 0.05 for SAT and P = 0.0001 for OmAT). Hepatic 11betaHSD1 activity correlated negatively with abdominal adipose area (P = 0.002) and expression positively with PEPCK (P = 0.003). In human obesity, glucocorticoid regeneration in the SAT is associated with central fat accumulation indicating that the importance of this specific fat depot is underestimated. Central fat accumulation is negatively associated with hepatic 11betaHSD1 activity. A disturbance in peripheral glucocorticoid metabolism is associated with changes in genes involved in fatty acid (FA) recycling in adipose tissue (AT).",M1
19303849,"A role of DNA-PK for the metabolic gene regulation in response to insulin.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is a central enzyme in lipogenesis and transcriptionally activated in response to feeding and insulin signaling. The transcription factor USF is required for the activation of FAS transcription, and we show here that USF phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which is dephosphorylated by PP1 in response to feeding, triggers a switch-like mechanism. Under fasting conditions, USF-1 is deacetylated by HDAC9, causing promoter inactivation. In contrast, feeding induces the recruitment of DNA-PK to USF-1 and its phosphorylation, which then allows recruitment of P/CAF, resulting in USF-1 acetylation and FAS promoter activation. DNA break/repair components associated with USF induce transient DNA breaks during FAS activation. In DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice, feeding-induced USF-1 phosphorylation/acetylation, DNA breaks, and FAS activation leading to lipogenesis are impaired, resulting in decreased triglyceride levels. Our study demonstrates that a kinase central to the DNA damage response mediates metabolic gene activation.",M1

19216096,"Correlation of electroretinography b-wave absolute latency, plasma levels of human basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fatty acid synthase, and adrenomedullin in diabetic retinopathy.BACKGROUND: We investigated the b-wave latency of electroretinogram (ERG), human basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble fatty acid synthase (s-<e>Fas</e>), and adrenomedullin (ADM) in diabetic retinopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty control and 60 type II diabetic women (mean age 45+/-3.9 years, duration of diabetes 10.1+/-2.1 years) were investigated. Diabetics without complications (Group II) and with retinopathy (Group III) were diagnosed depending on clinical findings, abnormal fundus examination, and ERG. Plasma levels of b-FGF, VEGF, s-Fas, and ADM were measured. RESULTS: ERG showed a significant increase of b-wave absolute latency, plasma b-FGF, VEGF, s-Fas, and ADM in diabetic retinopathy (P&lt;.05). A positive correlation was found between b-wave latency and VEGF and s-Fas, and a negative correlation with b-FGF and ADM. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the causative role of VEGF and s-Fas in diabetic retinopathy. VEGF may potently promote growth of endothelial cells and formation of new vessels implicated in proliferative retinopathy. s-Fas could be involved in advancement of apoptotic changes in retinopathy and high levels of b-FGF, and ADM may be compensatorily neuroprotective and vasculoprotective. The results showed that diabetic retinopathy is the result of multiple factors, so it is optimistic to believe that reversing VEGF or s-Fas will halt retinopathy, targeting multiple mechanisms simultaneously by administering combination treatments of VEGF antagonists; antiapoptotic drugs together with b-FGF and/or ADM may be prospective.",M1
19173288,"Fatty acid synthase is over-expressed in large aberrant crypt foci in rats treated with azoxymethane.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is over-expressed in many human cancers including colon. High levels of FAS expression have also been observed in a number of lesions that are precursors to invasive colorectal cancer. However, FAS expression in aberrant crypt foci (ACF), the earliest identifiable lesions in colon cancer development, has not been investigated. In this study, we treated Fisher rats with a single dose of the colon carcinogen azoxymethane then evaluated ACF 100 days later. We showed that large ACF (&gt;or=4 crypts/focus) have a significantly higher level of immunohistochemical staining for FAS than either small ACF (&lt;or=3 crypts/focus) or normal crypts. Furthermore, the severity of nuclear atypia in ACF was positively associated with increased expression of FAS. These findings suggest that the genes associated with FAS over-expression are activated early in the stepwise development of colon cancer, though not until the ACF have reached a critical size with a level of nuclear atypia indicative of dysplasia.",M1
19157823,"Regional differences in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue in response to short- and medium-term fasting and refeeding.The aim of this study was to analyze regional differences in the time-course response to fasting and refeeding in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in retroperitoneal, mesenteric and inguinal adipose tissue. Rats were studied under different feeding conditions: feeding state; after 4, 8 or 24 h of fasting; and after 3 h of refeeding following 8 h of fasting. The expression of lipogenesis-related genes decreased by fasting in adipose tissue, and the retroperitoneal depot showed the fastest response: mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARgamma2) decreased after 4 h of fasting and those of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), GPAT and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) decreased after 8 h. In the inguinal depot, mRNA levels of SREBP1c, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha, FAS and lipoprotein lipase decreased after 8 h of fasting, while in the mesenteric depot, only GLUT4 and FAS mRNA levels decreased after 8 and 24 h, respectively. Concerning lipolytic and fatty acid oxidation genes, only adipose triglyceride lipase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a expression increased after 24 h of fasting in the retroperitoneal depot. Three hours of refeeding restored the expression of the lipogenic transcription factors PPARgamma2 and SREBP1c in the retroperitoneal depot and of PPARgamma2 in the inguinal depot. This period of refeeding was ineffective in changing the expression of genes related with lipid mobilization and fatty acid oxidation, except hormone-sensitive lipase, whose expression decreased in the mesenteric depot. It is suggested that different regulations of the expression of genes related with lipid metabolism between internal and subcutaneous depots to feeding and fasting conditions are site-specific metabolic features of white adipose tissue.",M1
19151726,"Conformational flexibility of metazoan fatty acid synthase enables catalysis.The metazoan cytosolic fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) contains all of the enzymes required for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis covalently linked around two reaction chambers. Although the three-dimensional architecture of FAS has been mostly defined, it is unclear how reaction intermediates can transfer between distant catalytic domains. Using single-particle EM, we have identified a near continuum of conformations consistent with a remarkable flexibility of FAS. The distribution of conformations was influenced by the presence of substrates and altered by different catalytic mutations, suggesting a direct correlation between conformation and specific enzymatic activities. We interpreted three-dimensional reconstructions by docking high-resolution structures of individual domains, and they show that the substrate-loading and condensation domains dramatically swing and swivel to access substrates within either reaction chamber. Concomitant rearrangement of the beta-carbon-processing domains synchronizes acyl chain reduction in one chamber with acyl chain elongation in the other.",M1
19116881,"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) inhibits expression of the Spot 14 (THRSP) and fatty acid synthase genes and impairs the growth of human breast cancer and liposarcoma cells.Spot 14 (THRSP, S14) is a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of genes required for fatty acid synthesis in normal and malignant mammary epithelial and adipose cells. Harvatine and Bauman (1) reported that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) inhibits S14 gene expression in bovine mammary and mouse adipose tissues and reduces milk fat production in cows. We hypothesized that CLA inhibits S14 gene expression in human breast cancer and liposarcoma cells and that this will retard their growth. Exposure of T47D breast cancer cells to a mixture of CLA isomers reduced the expression of the S14 and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) genes. The mixture caused a dose-related inhibition of T47D cell growth, as did pure c9, t11 and t10, c12-CLA, but not linoleic acid. Similar effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Provision of 8 mircoM palmitate fully (CLA mix, t10, c12-CLA) or partially (c9, t11-CLA) reversed the antiproliferative effect in T47D cells. CLA likewise suppressed levels of S14 and FAS mRNAs in liposarcoma cells and caused growth inhibition that was prevented by palmitic acid. CLA did not affect the growth of nonlipogenic HeLa cells or human fibroblasts. We conclude that as in bovine mammary and mouse adipose cells, CLA suppresses S14 and FAS gene expression in human breast cancer and liposarcoma cells. Rescue from the antiproliferative effect of CLA by palmitic acid indicates that reduced tumor lipogenesis is a major mechanism for the anticancer effects of CLA.",M1
19107852,"Genistein suppresses adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells via multiple signal pathways.Genistein, an isoflavone, was shown to have therapeutic effects for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the effect and underlying mechanism of genistein on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Genistein inhibited lipid accumulation and decreased the nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) content of 3T3-L1 on day 6 after the induction of differentiation with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone and insulin (MDI). Genistein recovered nitric oxide (NO) release suppressed by MDI and the results were consistent with the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) assayed by western blotting. Pretreatment with genistein inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) stimulated with 10 microg/mL of insulin. Furthermore, genistein inhibited the expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) from 178% of the MDI group to 74%. SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, mimicked the FAS inhibition effect of genistein, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of genistein on FAS was partially via the p38 pathway. On the other hand, genistein abolished the phosphorylation of janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) in response to MDI. AG490, a JAK2 inhibitor, suppressed the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a marker of adipocyte differentiation. The findings suggest that genistein attenuates the differentiation of 3T3-L1 involving multiple signal pathways.",M1
19105208,"Liver X receptor mediates hepatitis B virus X protein-induced lipogenesis in hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.Although hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated in abnormal lipid metabolism in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatic steatosis, its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Liver X receptor (LXR) plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis. Here we demonstrate that LXRalpha and LXRbeta mediate HBV-associated hepatic steatosis. We have found that HBx induces the expression of LXR and its lipogenic target genes, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and this is accompanied by the accumulation of lipid droplets. RNA interference with LXR expression decreases the amount of lipid droplets as well as the expression of the lipogenic genes, and this indicates that HBx-induced lipogenesis is LXR-dependent. LXRalpha and HBx colocalize in the nucleus and are physically associated. HBx induces the transactivation function of LXRalpha by recruiting CREB binding protein to the promoter of the target gene. Furthermore, we have observed that expression of LXR is increased in the livers of HBx-transgenic mice. Finally, there is a significant increase in the expression of LXRbeta (P = 0.036), SREBP-1c (P = 0.008), FAS, and stearoyl-coenyzme A desaturase-1 (P = 0.001) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with adjacent nontumorous nodules in human HBV-associated HCC specimens. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a novel association between HBx and LXR that may represent an important mechanism explaining HBx-induced hepatic lipogenesis during HBV-associated hepatic carcinogenesis.",M1

19074144,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III activity is inhibited by phosphorylation on a single threonine residue.Mycolic acids are hallmark features of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall. They are synthesized by the condensation of two fatty acids, a C56-64-meromycolyl chain and a C24-26-fatty acyl chain. Meromycolates are produced via the combination of type I and type II fatty acid synthases (<e>FAS</e>-I and FAS-II). The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (mtFabH) links FAS-I and FAS-II, catalyzing the condensation of FAS-I-derived acyl-CoAs with malonyl-ACP. Because mtFabH represents a potential regulatory key point of the mycolic acid pathway, we investigated the hypothesis that phosphorylation of mtFabH controls its activity. Phosphorylation of proteins by Ser/Thr protein kinases (STPKs) has recently emerged as a major physiological mechanism of regulation in prokaryotes. We demonstrate here that mtFabH was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by several mycobacterial STPKs, particularly by PknF and PknA, as well as in vivo in mycobacteria. Analysis of the phosphoamino acid content indicated that mtFabH was phosphorylated exclusively on threonine residues. Mass spectrometry analyses using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry identified Thr45 as the unique phosphoacceptor. This was further supported by complete loss of PknF- or PknA-dependent phosphorylation of a mtFabH mutant. Mapping Thr45 on the crystal structure of mtFabH illustrates that this residue is located at the entrance of the substrate channel, suggesting that the phosphate group may alter accessibility of the substrate and thus affect mtFabH enzymatic activity. A T45D mutant of mtFabH, designed to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, exhibited markedly decreased transacylation, malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation, and condensing activities compared with the wild-type protein or the T45A mutant. Together, these findings not only represent the first demonstration of phosphorylation of a beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III enzyme but also indicate that phosphorylation of mtFabH inhibits its enzymatic activity, which may have important consequences in regulating mycolic acid biosynthesis.",M1
19048273,"In vivo and in vitro effects of SREBP-1 on diabetic renal tubular lipid accumulation and RNAi-mediated gene silencing study.Lipid deposits can injury the kidney of diabetic patients and models. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) is transcription factor regulating the synthesis of fatty acid and triglyceride. At present whether the expression of SREBP-1 makes some effects on the lipid accumulation in diabetic kidney is not still clear completely. The purpose of our in vivo and in vitro study is to investigate the relationship between the expression of SREBP-1 and lipid abnormal metabolism in the type 1 diabetic rats and explore to inhibit SREBP-1 gene expression by RNA interfere in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells line (HKC cells). The animal experiment showed that triglyceride and SREBP-1 were up-regulated in proximal tubule of diabetic rats' kidney, which may result in increase of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). The further HKC cells experiment confirmed SREBP-1 increasing resulted into lipid droplet formation. The expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in HKC cells transfected with specific plasmid for SREBP-1 gene was significantly more than that of the cells transfected with the control plasmid pcDNA3.1 and that of the untransfected cells. Simultaneously, up-regulation of TGF-beta1 and fibronectin, an ECM glycoprotein, was evident in HKC cells transfected by specific SREBP-1 plasmid. Furthermore, we found that high glucose was a positive factor on the expression of SREBP-1 at protein and mRNA levels in HKC cells. High glucose makes effects on SREBP-1 in time-dependent manner, and the greatest effect was at 48 h. In addition, two effective eukaryotic expression plasmid vectors of shRNA aimed at SREBP-1 were designed and constructed successfully. Compared with the negative control plasmid group, the levels of the expression of SREBP-1 were inhibited by 24.11 and 36.15%, respectively, at mRNA level, 20.80 and 37.59%, respectively, at precursor segment of protein level, and 38.12 and 52.24%, respectively, at mature segment of protein level at 48 h after transfection. In vivo and in vitro study suggested that high glucose caused increasing SREBP-1 mRNA and protein in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells of type 1 diabetic rats. Increasing SREBP-1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal lipid accumulation by up-regulation of FAS and ECM accumulation by inducing TGF-beta1 expression. The application of vector-mediated RNAi could markedly inhibit the expression of SREBP-1 in HKC cells, which is a promising tool for future research into the mechanisms of renal lipid accumulation in vivo.",M1
19043794,"Comparison of insulin signaling gene expression in insulin sensitive tissues between cats and dogs.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disease in cats and dogs with increasing prevalence. Type 1 DM appears to be the most common form of diabetes in dogs whereas Type 2 DM prevails for cats. Since insulin resistance is more frequently encountered in cats than dogs, our laboratory was interested in determining whether differences at the insulin signaling pathway level and differences in glucose and lipid metabolism could be observed between cats and dogs. Insulin resistance has been positively correlated to insulin signaling pathway abnormalities. As such, this study measured insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) P-85alpha mRNA expression levels in classical insulin-responsive sensitive tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and abdominal fat) and peripheral leukocytes between cats and dogs by qRT-PCR. Different tissues were sampled because it is currently unknown where insulin-resistance arises from. In addition, enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) were also assessed since glucose and lipid metabolism differs between cats and dogs. Overall, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3-K, MDH, G6DPH, and FAS mRNA tissue expression profiles demonstrated different levels of expression, in various tissues for both canines and felines, which was expected. No distinct expression pattern emerged; however, differences were noted between canines and felines. In addition, IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3-K, MDH, G6DPH, and FAS mRNA expression was significantly higher in canine versus feline tissues, including peripheral leukocytes. Remarkable differences in insulin signaling gene expression between felines and canines indicate that cats may have an underlying low insulin sensitivity level due to low IRS-1, IRS-2, and PI3-K P-85alpha mRNA expression levels which would predispose cats to develop insulin resistance. Moreover, differences in glucose and lipid metabolism related gene expression (MDH, G6DPH, and FAS) demonstrate that felines have an overall lower metabolic rate in various tissues which may be attributed to overall lower insulin signaling gene expression and a lack of physical activity as compared to canines. Therefore, a combination of genetic and environmental factors appears to make felines more prone to suffer from insulin resistance and type 2 DM than canines.",M1
19026012,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) regulates hepatic lipogenesis, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and the secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins.Hepatic apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoprotein production is metabolically regulated via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase cascade; however, the role of the key negative regulator of this pathway, the tumor suppressor phosphatase with tensin homology (PTEN), is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic protein levels of apoB100 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) are significantly down-regulated (73% and 36%, respectively) in the liver of PTEN liver-specific knockout (KO) mice, and this is accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) accumulation and lipogenic gene expression, and reduced hepatic apoB secretion in freshly isolated hepatocytes. MTP protein mass and lipid transfer activity were also significantly reduced in liver of PTEN KO mice. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant PTEN C/S124 (adenovirus expressing PTEN C/S mutant [AdPTENC/S]) possessing constitutive phospoinositide 3-kinase activity in HepG2 cells led to significant reductions in both secreted apoB100 and cellular MTP mass (76% and 34%, respectively), and increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Reduced apoB100 secretion induced by AdPTENC/S was associated with increased degradation of newly-synthesized cellular apoB100, in a lactacystin-sensitive manner, suggesting enhanced proteasomal degradation. AdPTENC/S also reduced apoB-lipoprotein production in McA-RH7777 and primary hamster hepatocytes. Our findings suggest a link between PTEN expression and hepatic production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. We postulate that perturbations in PTEN not only may influence hepatic insulin signaling and hepatic lipogenesis, but also may alter hepatic apoB-lipoprotein production and the MTP stability. On loss of PTEN activity, increased lipid substrate availability in the face of reduced hepatic lipoprotein production capacity can rapidly lead to hepatosteatosis and fatty liver.",M1
18975056,"The role of LXR alpha in goose primary hepatocyte lipogenesis.In this study, we investigate the role of liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) in lipogenesis in geese in order to understand the differences in hepatic steatosis mechanisms between mammals and waterfowl. Primary goose hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the LXR alpha agonist T0901317. Triglyceride (TG) accumulation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC alpha) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) activities, and gene expression levels of LXR alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), FAS, ACC alpha and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were measured in primary hepatocytes. We found a dose-dependent up-regulation of TG accumulation, ACC, and FAS activities and the mRNA levels of LXR alpha, SREBP-1, FAS, ACC alpha, and LPL genes in the presence of To-901317. We also found that binding of nuclear SREBP-1 to ACC alpha SRE sequence was induced by To-901317 (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, LXR alpha is involved in the induction of the lipogenic pathway through activation of SREBP-1 and its target genes in goose primary hepatocytes.",M1
18972582,"Astragaloside IV attenuates lipolysis and improves insulin resistance induced by TNFalpha in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Increased circulating free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations have been demonstrated to potentially link obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is a saponin which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of AS-IV on the lipolysis and insulin resistance induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TNFalpha promotes lipolysis in mammal adipocytes via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family resulting in reduced expression/function of perilipin. Application of AS-IV inhibited TNFalpha-induced accelerated lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, which was compatible with suppressed phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reversed the downregulation of perilipin. Moreover, TNFalpha induced downregulation of key enzymes in lipogenesis, including LPL, <e>FAS</e> and GPAT, were also attenuated by AS-IV. Further studies showed that AS-IV improved TNFalpha-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This study provides the first direct evidence of the antilipolytic action of AS-IV in adipocytes, which may allow this agent to decrease the circulating FFA levels, thus increase insulin sensitivity and treat cardiovascular diseases.",M1
18949744,"Immunohistochemical expression of fatty acid synthase, Ki-67 and p53 in squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is a recently discovered molecule involved in the energy supply to normal cells. FAS is overexpressed in neoplastic tissues because of their increased energy needs. We explored the immunohistochemical expression of FAS, Ki-67 and p53 in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the larynx and their association with clinicopathological features and outcome. Specimens from 43 patients with SCC were evaluated. Statistical analysis revealed an association between poorly differentiated laryngeal carcinomas and FAS expression (p&lt;0.005) and between FAS and Ki-67 overexpression (p&lt;0.001). Finally, FAS expression was associated with overall survival (p&lt;0.001).

18838394,"Stra13/DEC1 and DEC2 inhibit sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c in a hypoxia-inducible factor-dependent mechanism.Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) homodimeric transactivator, which induces itself and several lipogenic enzymes, notably fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). We demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) represses the SREBP-1c gene by inducing Stimulated with retinoic acid (Stra)13/Differentiated embryo chondrocyte 1(DEC1) and its isoform, DEC2. Stra13/DEC1 and DEC2 are bHLH homodimeric transcription repressors. We found that both Stra13 and DEC2 inhibit SREBP-1c-induced transcription by competing with SREBP-1c for binding to the E-box in the SREBP-1c promoter and/or by interacting with SREBP-1c protein. DEC2 is instantly and temporarily induced in acute hypoxia, while Stra13 is induced in prolonged hypoxia. This expression profile reflects the finding that Stra13 represses DEC2, thus maintains low level of DEC2 in prolonged hypoxia. DEC2-siRNA restores the hypoxic repression but Stra13-siRNA fails to do so, suggesting that DEC2 is the major initiator of hypoxic repression of SREBP-1c, whereas Stra13 substitutes for DEC2 in prolonged hypoxia. Our findings imply that Stra13 and DEC2 are the mediators to repress SREBP-1c gene in response to hypoxia. By doing so, HIF and its targets, Stra13 and DEC2 reduce the ATP consuming anabolic lipogenesis prior to the actual decrease of ATP acting as a feed-forward mechanism.",M1
18829285,"Down-regulation in muscle and liver lipogenic genes: EPA ethyl ester treatment in lean and overweight (high-fat-fed) rats.The precise mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids improve fat metabolism are not completely understood. This study was designed to determine the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester administration on the expression levels of several muscle, liver and adipose tissue genes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation pathways. Male Wistar rats fed a standard diet (control animals) or a high-fat diet were treated daily by oral gavage with EPA ethyl ester (1g/kg) for 5 weeks. The high-fat diet caused a very significant increase in plasma cholesterol (P&lt;.01) levels, which was reverted by EPA (P&lt;.001). A significant decrease in circulating triglyceride levels (P&lt;.05) was also observed in EPA-treated groups. EPA administration induced a significant down-regulation in some lipogenic genes such as muscle acetyl CoA carboxylase beta (ACC beta) (P&lt;.05) and liver fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) (P&lt;.05). Furthermore, a decrease in glucokinase (GK) gene expression was observed in EPA-treated animals fed a control diet (P&lt;.01), whereas a significant increase in GK mRNA levels was found in groups fed a high-fat diet. On the other hand, no alterations in genes involved in beta-oxidation, such acetyl CoA synthase 4 (ACS4), acetyl CoA synthase 5 (ACS5) or acetyl CoA oxidase (ACO), were found in EPA-treated groups. Surprisingly and opposite to the expectations, a very significant decrease in the expression levels of liver PPARalpha (P&lt;.01) was observed after EPA treatment. These findings show the ability of EPA ethyl ester treatment to down-regulate some genes involved in fatty acid synthesis without affecting the transcriptional activation of beta-oxidation-related genes.",M1

METHODS: The expression levels of FAS and H-FABP in 81 ductal infiltrating carcinoma (DIC) were detected by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The possible associations of the expression of the two proteins with major clinicopathological factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of both H-FABP and FAS increased in DIC cells than in adjacent normal cells. But less H-FABP and FAS were found in grade III DIC than in grade I and grade II DIC (P &lt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the expression of H-FABP and FAS. No correlations between the expressions of two genes with other clinicopathological factors were found. CONCLUSION: The higher expression of H-FABP in grade I and II DIC suggests an early increased response to the over-expression of FAS. The parallel increase of H-FABP and FAS expressions marks increased breast cancer risk.",M1
18796435,"Inhibition of fatty-acid synthase induces caspase-8-mediated tumor cell apoptosis by up-regulating DDIT4.Fatty-acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is up-regulated in a broad range of cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, and ovaries. In tumor cells, the inhibition of FAS elicits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, so it is considered a potential drug target for oncology. Results from this study show that inhibition of FAS, by either knockdown with small interfering RNA or inhibition with the small molecule drug orlistat, leads to activation of the receptor-mediated apoptotic cascade (caspase-8-mediated) and ultimately to cell death. However, knockdown of two enzymes upstream of FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha and ATP-citrate lyase, fails to activate caspase-8 or to elicit apoptosis in tumor cells, even though palmitate synthesis was suppressed. Using differential gene analysis, we traced the unique apoptotic effect of FAS inhibition to up-regulation of DDIT4 (DNA damage-inducible transcript 4), a stress-response gene that negatively regulates the mTOR pathway. These findings indicate that suppression of palmitate synthesis is not sufficient for eliciting tumor cell death and suggest that the unique effect of inhibition of FAS results from negative regulation of the mTOR pathway via DDIT4.",M1
18719599,"Regulation of food intake and energy expenditure by hypothalamic malonyl-CoA.Energy balance is monitored by the hypothalamus. Malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, serves as an indicator of energy status in the hypothalamic neurons. The cellular malonyl-CoA level is determined by its rate of synthesis, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and rate of removal, by fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). Malonyl-CoA functions in the hypothalamic neurons that express orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides. Inhibitors of FAS, administered systemically or intracerebroventricularly to mice, increase hypothalamic malony-CoA and suppress food intake. Recent evidence suggests that the changes of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA during feeding and fasting cycles are caused by changes in the phosphorylation state and activity of ACC mediated via 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Stereotactic delivery of a viral malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) vector into the ventral hypothalamus lowers malonyl-CoA and increases food intake. Fasting decreases hypothalamic malonyl-CoA and refeeding increases hypothalamic malonyl-CoA, to alter feeding behavior in the predicted manner. Malonyl-CoA level is under the control of AMP kinase which phosphorylates/inactivates ACC. Malonyl-CoA is an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase-1 (CPT1), an outer mitochondrial membrane enzyme that regulates entry into, and oxidation of fatty acids, by mitochondria. CPT1c, a recently discovered, brain-specific enzyme expressed in the hypothalamus, has high sequence similarity to liver/muscle CPT1a/b and binds malonyl-CoA, but does not catalyze the prototypical reaction. This suggests that CPT1c has a unique function or activation mechanism. CPT1c knockout (KO) mice have lower food intake, weigh less and have less body fat, consistent with the role as an energy-sensing malonyl-CoA target. Paradoxically, CPT1c protects against the effects of a high-fat diet. CPT1cKO mice exhibit decreased rates of fatty acid oxidation, consistent with their increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. We suggest that CPT1c may be a downstream target of malonyl-CoA that regulates energy homeostasis.",M1
18794597,"Altered expression of transcription factors and genes regulating lipogenesis in liver and adipose tissue of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether expression of transcription factors and lipogenic enzymes is altered in liver and adipose tissue of mice with obesity, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: Mice were fed chow containing 9% of calories from standard fat (SF) or 20% of calories from high fat (HF) and killed after 9 months in the fasted or fed state. MEASUREMENTS: Liver injury was evaluated by histology and serum aminotransferase levels. Transcription factor expression was measured by real-time PCR. Lipogenic enzymes were measured by real-time PCR and Western blots. RESULTS: HF mice weighed more, had insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and focal pericellular hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, carbohydrate response element-binding protein, liver X receptor-alpha, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) decreased during fasting in SF and HF mice; however, FAS expression and protein content were higher in the liver of fasted HF mice than of fasted SF mice. In adipose tissue, expression of sterol response element-binding protein-1c, carbohydrate response element-binding protein, liver X receptor-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, ACC, and FAS decreased with fasting in mice fed SF, but not in HF mice. ACC and FAS expression and protein content remained higher during fasting in HF than in SF mice. CONCLUSION: Feeding a nutritionally complete diet containing a moderate increase in fat produces obesity and steatohepatitis. During fasting, hepatic FAS expression and protein content are increased in HF mice. Transcription factor expression, and lipogenic enzyme expression and protein concentration do not decline during fasting in adipose tissue from HF mice. De-novo lipogenesis may persist in liver and adipose tissue during fasting in obesity/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",M1
18794082,"Control of cell growth and survival by enzymes of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.PURPOSE: For many tumor cells, de novo lipogenesis is a requirement for growth and survival. A considerable body of work suggests that inhibition of this pathway may be a powerful approach to antineoplastic therapy. It has recently been shown that inhibition of various steps in the lipogenic pathway individually can induce apoptosis or loss of viability in tumor cells. However, it is not clear whether quantitative differences exist in the ability of lipogenic enzymes to control tumor cell survival. We present a systematic approach that allows for a direct comparison of the control of lipogenic pathway enzymes over tumor cell growth and apoptosis using different cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNA interference-mediated, graded down-regulation of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) pathway enzymes was employed in combination with measurements of lipogenesis, apoptosis, and cell growth. RESULTS: In applying RNA interference titrations to two lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and FAS, we show that ACC1 and FAS both significantly control cell growth and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells. These results also extend to PC-3 and A2780 cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Control of tumor cell survival by different steps in de novo lipogenesis can be quantified. Because ACC1 and FAS both significantly control tumor cell growth and apoptosis, we propose that pharmacologic inhibitors of either enzyme might be useful agents in targeting cancer cells that critically rely on fatty acid synthesis. The experimental approach described here may be extended to other targets or disease-relevant pathways to identify steps suitable for therapeutic intervention.",M1
18786595,"Alleviative effects of s-allyl cysteine and s-ethyl cysteine on MCD diet-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.Alleviative effects of s-allyl cysteine (SAC) and s-ethyl cysteine (SEC) upon methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced hepatotoxicity in mice were examined. SAC or SEC at 1g/L was added into drinking water for 7 weeks with MCD diet. MCD feeding significantly increased hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and elevated the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (P &lt; 0.05). However, the intake of SAC or SEC significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and reduced G6PDH and FAS activities (P &lt; 0.05). MCD feeding significantly lowered serum and hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) formation, and suppressed the activity and mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (P &lt; 0.05). The intake of SAC or SEC significantly increased serum and hepatic GSH levels, decreased MDA and GSSG formation, restored the activity and mRNA expression of GPX, SOD and catalase (P &lt; 0.05). MCD feeding significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and collagen-alpha1 (P &lt; 0.05). The intake of SAC and SEC significantly blunted the mRNA expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and collagen-alpha1 (P &lt; 0.05). SEC was greater than SAC in suppressing IL-6 and TNF-alpha expression (P &lt; 0.05), but SAC was greater than SEC in suppressing collagen-alpha1 and TGF-beta1 expression (P &lt; 0.05).

Recently, we showed that HBx (HBV protein X) expression induces lipid accumulation in hepatic cells mediated by the induction of SREBP1 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1), a key regulator of lipogenic genes in the liver. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HBx increases SREBP1 expression and transactivation remain to be clearly elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that HBx interacts with LXRalpha (liver X receptor alpha) and enhances the binding of LXRalpha to LXRE (LXR-response element), thereby resulting in the up-regulation of SREBP1 and <e>FAS</e> (fatty acid synthase) in the presence or absence of the LXR agonist T0901317 in the hepatic cells and HBx-transgenic mice. Furthermore, HBx also augments the ability to recruit ASC2 (activating signal co-integrator 2), a transcriptional co-activator that controls liver lipid metabolic pathways, to the LXRE with LXRalpha. These studies place LXRalpha in a key position within the HBx-induced lipogenic pathways, and suggest a molecular mechanism through which HBV infection can stimulate the SREBP1-mediated control of hepatic lipid accumulation.",M1
18776140,"Fatty acid synthase inhibitors modulate energy balance via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling in the central nervous system.OBJECTIVE: Evidence links the hypothalamic fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) pathway to the regulation of food intake and body weight. This includes pharmacological inhibitors that potently reduce feeding and body weight. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular fuel sensor whose activity in the hypothalamus is also linked to the regulation of energy balance. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether hypothalamic mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling is involved in mediating the effects of FAS inhibitors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured the hypothalamic phosphorylation of two downstream targets of mTORC1, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and S6 ribosomal protein (S6), after administration of the FAS inhibitors C75 and cerulenin in rats. We evaluated food intake in response to FAS inhibitors in rats pretreated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and in mice lacking functional S6K1 (S6K1(-/-)). Food intake and phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 were also determined after C75 injection in rats maintained on a ketogenic diet. RESULTS: C75 and cerulenin increased phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6, and their anorexic action was reduced in rapamycin-treated rats and in S6K1(-/-) mice. Consistent with our previous findings, C75 was ineffective at reducing caloric intake in ketotic rats. Under ketosis, C75 was also less efficient at stimulating mTORC1 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively indicate an important interaction between the FAS and mTORC1 pathways in the central nervous system for regulating energy balance, possibly via modulation of neuronal glucose utilization.",M1
18760332,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase activities in human hypothalamus.Several data indicate that hypothalamic fatty acid synthesis pathway plays an important role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure in rodents. However, the confirmation of its physiological relevance in regulation of feeding in human remains incomplete. For fatty acid synthesis pathway to function as regulator of energy balance in human hypothalamus, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and other lipogenic enzymes activities must be present. The presence of FAS in human hypothalamic neurons has been shown by immunohistochemistry, but quantitative studies on FAS activity there has not been performed so far. There is no available data concerning ACC activity in human hypothalamus. Thus, we investigated ACC and FAS (as well as other lipogenic enzymes) activities in human hypothalamus of subjects who died in car accidents. The results presented in this paper indicate that ACC and FAS activities are present in human hypothalamus and that these activities are 2- to 3-fold lower than in rat hypothalamus. Moreover, our data presented in this paper indicate that other lipogenic enzymes activities are also present in human hypothalamus. The activity of FAS, ACC and other lipogenic enzymes in human hypothalamus suggests that fatty acid synthesis actively occurs there. Therefore, it is likely, that in human this pathway may be relevant to hypothalamic functioning as food intake and energy expenditure regulator, similarly as it was suggested in rodents.",M1
18756992,"[Activation of liver X receptor regulates fatty acid synthase expression in diabetic liver]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of liver X receptor (LXR) on the expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in diabetic liver. METHODS: Sixteen-week-old male db/db mice with C57BL/6 background were administered via gavaging of T0901317 (TO), a LXR synthetic agonist, at the dose of 3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) or dimethyl sulfide (DMSO), a vehicle alone for 7 days. Then the mice were killed with their livers taken out to undergo immunohistochemistry to observe the distribution of FAS protein. Human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell of the line HepG2 were cultured with TO (10 micromol/L) or DMSO for 24 hours. Another HepG2 cells were transfected with mouse FAS promoter-luciferase reporter recombinants with or without pcDNA3.1, LXR expression vector, or an active sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) expression vector for 12 hours. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the levels of mRNA and protein of FAS and SREBP-1c respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized to examine the activity of mouse FAS promoter. RESULTS: FAS was abundantly expressed in the mouse livers, especially in the cytoplasm of liver cells. The FAS mRNA levels of the livers of the db/db mice was about 5.5 times as high as that of the db/m mice (P &lt; 0.01). The FAS protein levels in the livers of db/db and db/m mice treated with TO were 1.7 and 3.5 times higher than those of the control mice (both P &lt; 0.05). The SREBP-1 mRNA levels in the liver of the db/m and db/db mice treated with TO were 2.4 and 2.1 times higher compared with the control mice (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). Luciferase test showed that the FAS promoter activity of the HepG2 cells treated with TO was 1.5 times that of the control cells (P &lt; 0.01). The FAS promoter activities of the HepG2 cells transfected with LXR and SREBP-1c were 1.9 and 1.6 times those of the control cells (botn P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: LXRE directly or indirect (via SREBP-lc) upregulates the expression of FAS gene in the diabetic liver. LXR may mediate the lipid accumulation in liver of diabetes.",M1
18752865,"Investigation of the role of SREBP-1c in the pathogenesis of HCV-related steatosis.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Increased expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a transcription factor regulating lipogenesis, has been reported in HCV core protein-transfected hepatocytes. Our aim was to investigate the role of SREBP-1c in the pathogenesis of HCV-related steatosis. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with HCV and 13 subjects with histologically normal liver (NDL) were studied. The mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) was measured by qPCR, and SREBP-1 protein quantitated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the hepatic expression of SREBP-1c mRNA between subjects with HCV and NDL. In patients with HCV, a significant negative relationship was seen between hepatic SREBP-1c mRNA expression and grade of steatosis (r(s)=-0.28, p=0.002), stage of fibrosis (r(s)=-0.375, p&lt;0.001) and severity of inflammation (r(s)=-0.313, p&lt;0.001). These relationships were observed for patients infected with either viral genotype 1 or 3. Following multivariate logistic regression analysis, hepatic SREBP-1c expression remained independently associated with fibrosis (p=0.008) and hepatic inflammation (p=0.005). HCV-infected patients with HOMA&gt;2 had significantly higher expression of FAS mRNA than HCV-infected subjects with HOMA2 (p=0.006) and NDL (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: SREBP-1c may not play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of HCV-related steatosis.",M1
18725634,"Inhibition of the fungal fatty acid synthase type I multienzyme complex.Fatty acids are among the major building blocks of living cells, making lipid biosynthesis a potent target for compounds with antibiotic or antineoplastic properties. We present the crystal structure of the 2.6-MDa Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) multienzyme in complex with the antibiotic cerulenin, representing, to our knowledge, the first structure of an inhibited fatty acid megasynthase. Cerulenin attacks the FAS ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain, forming a covalent bond to the active site cysteine C1305. The inhibitor binding causes two significant conformational changes of the enzyme. First, phenylalanine F1646, shielding the active site, flips and allows access to the nucleophilic cysteine. Second, methionine M1251, placed in the center of the acyl-binding tunnel, rotates and unlocks the inner part of the fatty acid binding cavity. The importance of the rotational movement of the gatekeeping M1251 side chain is reflected by the cerulenin resistance and the changed product spectrum reported for S. cerevisiae strains mutated in the adjacent glycine G1250. Platensimycin and thiolactomycin are two other potent inhibitors of KSs. However, in contrast to cerulenin, they show selectivity toward the prokaryotic FAS system. Because the flipped F1646 characterizes the catalytic state accessible for platensimycin and thiolactomycin binding, we superimposed structures of inhibited bacterial enzymes onto the S. cerevisiae FAS model. Although almost all side chains involved in inhibitor binding are conserved in the FAS multienzyme, a different conformation of the loop K1413-K1423 of the KS domain might explain the observed low antifungal properties of platensimycin and thiolactomycin.",M1
18710210,"Synthesis of novel beta-lactone inhibitors of fatty acid synthase.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is necessary for growth and survival of tumor cells and is a promising drug target for oncology. Here, we report on the syntheses and activity of novel inhibitors of the thioesterase domain of FAS. Using the structure of orlistat as a starting point, which contains a beta-lactone as the central pharmacophore, 28 novel congeners were synthesized and examined. Structural features such as the length of the alpha- and beta-alkyl chains, their chemical composition, and amino ester substitutions were altered and the resulting compounds explored for inhibitory activity toward the thioesterase domain of FAS. Nineteen congeners show improved potency for FAS in biochemical assays relative to orlistat. Three of that subset, including the natural product valilactone, also display an increased potency in inducing tumor cell death and improved solubility compared to orlistat. These findings support the idea that an orlistat congener can be optimized for use in a preclinical drug design and for clinical drug development.",M1
18706411,"Effect of centrally administered C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in mice.The central or systemic administration of 3-carboxy-4-octyl-2-methylenebutyrolactone (C75), a synthetic inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), causes anorexia and profound weight loss in rodents. The amount of food intake and gastrointestinal mobility are closely related. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the effects and mechanisms of C75 on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection in mice. Our data showed that C75 (1, 5, 10 microg/mouse) dose-dependently delayed gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit in fasted mice. 10 microg C75 delayed gastric emptying by about 21.4% and reduced gastrointestinal transit by about 31.0% compared with vehicle control group. Administration (i.c.v.) of 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor) or ghrelin attenuated the delayed gastrointestinal mobility effect induced by 10 microg C75. Taken together, C75 is able to decrease gastrointestinal mobility and it seems possible that malonyl-CoA and ghrelin might play an intermediary role in these processes.",M1
18691644,"Inhibition of Coix seed extract on fatty acid synthase, a novel target for anticancer activity.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Coix seed has been traditionally used to treat cancers in folk medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: Study the anticancer action mechanism of Coix seed extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the treatment with Coix seed extract (10 microl/ml), the residual activity of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) as overall reaction, beta-ketoacyl reduction, enoyl reduction, and acetyl acetyl coenzyme A (AcAcCoA) reduction was separately detected at 340 nm in the UV-190 spectrophotometer. After rats were administrated Coix seed extract (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 ml/kg) intragastrically for 10 days consecutively, activities of FAS, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), lipid protein lipase (LPL), hepatic lipase (HL), triglyceride (TG), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) in the plasma, liver and fatty tissues were determined. RESULTS: Experiments in vitro showed that the inhibition of Coix seed extract on FAS activity was significant and dose dependent, and two active sites inhibited were beta-ketoacyl reductases (KR) and enoyl reductase (ER). Experiments in vivo showed that Coix seed extract inhibited FAS activity in the liver, and elevated LPL and HL activity in the plasma, and effected G-6-PD activity. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports that FAS is a novel target for anticancer activity, and provides a theoretical foundation for the wide application of Coix seed extract in traditional medicine.",M1
18682535,"Hepatic regulation of fatty acid synthase by insulin and T3: evidence for T3 genomic and nongenomic actions.Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is a key enzyme of hepatic lipogenesis responsible for the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids. This enzyme is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by nutrients and hormones. In particular, glucose, insulin, and T(3) increase FAS activity, whereas glucagon and saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease it. In the present study we show that, in liver, T(3) and insulin were able to activate FAS enzymatic activity, mRNA expression, and gene transcription. We localized the T(3) response element (TRE) that mediates the T(3) genomic effect, on the FAS promoter between -741 and -696 bp that mediates the T(3) genomic effect. We show that both T(3) and insulin regulate FAS transcription via this sequence. The TRE binds a TR/RXR heterodimer even in the absence of hormone, and this binding is increased in response to T(3) and/or insulin treatment. The use of H7, a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, reveals that a phosphorylation mechanism is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of FAS in response to both hormones. Specifically, we show that T(3) is able to modulate FAS transcription via a nongenomic action targeting the TRE through the activation of a PI 3-kinase-ERK1/2-MAPK-dependent pathway. Insulin also targets the TRE sequence, probably via the activation of two parallel pathways: Ras/ERK1/2 MAPK and PI 3-kinase/Akt. Finally, our data suggest that the nongenomic actions of T(3) and insulin are probably common to several TREs, as we observed similar effects on a classical DR4 consensus sequence.",M1
18639282,"Fatty acid synthase over expression is an indicator of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in renal cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: Fatty acid synthase is a key enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids. Increased fatty acid synthase expression and its association with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis have been demonstrated in various human malignant tumors. We investigated fatty acid synthase expression in patients with renal cell carcinoma and its impact on clinicopathological parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fatty acid synthase expression in 120 patients with renal cancer was examined by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between fatty acid synthase expression status and various clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Survival analysis was performed using the log rank test and a Cox multivariate hazard model. RESULTS: Of 120 tumors 18 (15%) showed positive fatty acid synthase expression, which was significantly associated with advanced pathological T stage (pT3-4, p = 0.0009), regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0429), distant metastasis (p = 0.0042), higher histological grade (G3, p = 0.0017) and microvascular invasion (p = 0.0357). Patients with positive fatty acid synthase expression had significantly shorter cancer specific survival than those with negative <e>FAS</e> expression (p &lt;0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis demonstrated that positive fatty acid synthase expression was an independent predictor of shortened cancer specific survival (p = 0.0363, HR 3.736). CONCLUSIONS: Increased FAS expression could be an indicator of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. Patients with fatty acid synthase positive tumors should be followed closely and carefully, and adjuvant therapy should be considered.",M1
18599816,"Synthesis and biological evaluation of NAS-21 and NAS-91 analogues as potential inhibitors of the mycobacterial <e>FAS</e>-II dehydratase enzyme Rv0636.The identification of potential new anti-tubercular chemotherapeutics is paramount due to the recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Libraries of NAS-21 and NAS-91 analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their whole-cell activity against Mycobacterium bovis BCG. NAS-21 analogues 1 and 2 demonstrated enhanced whole-cell activity in comparison to the parental compound, and an M. bovis BCG strain overexpressing the dehydratase enzyme Rv0636 was resistant to these analogues. NAS-91 analogues with ortho-modifications gave enhanced whole-cell activity. However, extension with biphenyl modifications compromised the whole-cell activities of both NAS-21 and NAS-91 analogues. Interestingly, both libraries demonstrated in vitro activity against fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) but not FAS-I in cell-free extracts. In in vitro assays of FAS-II inhibition, NAS-21 analogues 4 and 5 had IC(50) values of 28 and 19 mug ml(-1), respectively, for the control M. bovis strain, and the M. bovis BCG strain overexpressing Rv0636 showed a marked increase in resistance. In contrast, NAS-91 analogues demonstrated moderate in vitro activity, although increased resistance was again observed in FAS-II activity assays with the Rv0636-overexpressing strain. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and mycolic acid methyl ester (MAME) analysis of M. bovis BCG and the Rv0636-overexpressing strain revealed that the effect of the drug was relieved in the overexpressing strain, further implicating and potentially identifying Rv0636 as the target for these known FabZ dehydratase inhibitors. This study has identified candidates for further development as drug therapeutics against the mycobacterial FAS-II dehydratase enzyme.",M1
18591393,"Decreased fetal size is associated with beta-cell hyperfunction in early life and failure with age.OBJECTIVE: Low birth weight is associated with diabetes in adult life. Accelerated or  catch-up  postnatal growth in response to small birth size is thought to presage disease years later. Whether adult disease is caused by intrauterine beta-cell-specific programming or by altered metabolism associated with catch-up growth is unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We generated a new model of intrauterine growth restriction due to fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) haploinsufficiency (FAS deletion [FASDEL]). Developmental programming of diabetes in these mice was assessed from in utero to 1 year of age. RESULTS: FASDEL mice did not manifest catch-up growth or insulin resistance. beta-Cell mass and insulin secretion were strikingly increased in young FASDEL mice, but beta-cell failure and diabetes occurred with age. FASDEL beta-cells had altered proliferative and apoptotic responses to the common stress of a high-fat diet. This sequence appeared to be developmentally entrained because beta-cell mass was increased in utero in FASDEL mice and in another model of intrauterine growth restriction caused by ectopic expression of uncoupling protein-1. Increasing intrauterine growth in FASDEL mice by supplementing caloric intake of pregnant dams normalized beta-cell mass in utero. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased intrauterine body size, independent of postnatal growth and insulin resistance, appears to regulate beta-cell mass, suggesting that developing body size might represent a physiological signal that is integrated through the pancreatic beta-cell to establish a template for hyperfunction in early life and beta-cell failure with age.",M1
18583073,"Parasitic loranthus from Loranthaceae rather than Viscaceae potently inhibits fatty acid synthase and reduces body weight in mice.AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous results have shown one species of parasitic loranthus (Taxillus chinensis (DC.) Dancer) exhibits potent inhibition on fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) that is proposed to be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of obesity. However, the medicinal parasitic loranthus come from tens of plants of two families, the Loranthaceae and the Viscaceae. This study was carried out to figure out whether these parasitic loranthus from the two families have similar inhibitory ability on FAS, and whether the parasitic loranthus with potent inhibitory ability on FAS significantly reduce body weight of animal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD-1 mice were used to test the effects of samples on their body weight and food intake in 20 days. The reversible and irreversible inhibition on FAS was assayed to study the inhibitory ability of sixteen different medicinal plants from these two families, which were collected in nature. RESULTS: The reversible inhibitory ability of the extracts from the Loranthaceae was nearly 400-fold stronger than that from the Viscaceae. The species from the genus Taxillus Tieghem showed the best effect on FAS in both reversible and irreversible inhibition. Moreover, the difference in host plants did not affect markedly on the inhibitory ability of parasitic loranthus. The medicinal herb with high inhibitory ability on FAS significantly reduced the body weight and food intake of mice by oral administration. CONCLUSIONS: The medicinal herbs from the family Loranthaceae, rather than those from the family Viscaceae, should be suitable to apply as botanical sources of parasitic loranthus for weight control. The herbs from genus Taxillus Tieghem are the best.",M1
18576636,"In vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids to probe structure, dynamics, and ligand binding in a large protein by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.In vivo incorporation of isotopically labeled unnatural amino acids into large proteins drastically reduces the complexity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Incorporation is accomplished by coexpressing an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair specific for the unnatural amino acid added to the media and the protein of interest with a TAG amber codon at the desired incorporation site. To demonstrate the utility of this approach for NMR studies, 2-amino-3-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)propanoic acid (OCF 3Phe), (13)C/(15)N-labeled p-methoxyphenylalanine (OMePhe), and (15)N-labeled o-nitrobenzyl-tyrosine (oNBTyr) were incorporated individually into 11 positions around the active site of the 33 kDa thioesterase domain of human fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>-TE). In the process, a novel tRNA synthetase was evolved for OCF 3Phe. Incorporation efficiencies and FAS-TE yields were improved by including an inducible copy of the respective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase gene on each incorporation plasmid. Using only between 8 and 25 mg of unnatural amino acid, typically 2 mg of FAS-TE, sufficient for one 0.1 mM NMR sample, were produced from 50 mL of Escherichia coli culture grown in rich media. Singly labeled protein samples were then used to study the binding of a tool compound. Chemical shift changes in (1)H-(15)N HSQC, (1)H-(13)C HSQC, and (19)F NMR spectra of the different single site mutants consistently identified the binding site and the effect of ligand binding on conformational exchange of some of the residues. OMePhe or OCF 3Phe mutants of an active site tyrosine inhibited binding; incorporating (15)N-Tyr at this site through UV-cleavage of the nitrobenzyl-photocage from oNBTyr re-established binding. These data suggest not only robust methods for using unnatural amino acids to study large proteins by NMR but also establish a new avenue for the site-specific labeling of proteins at individual residues without altering the protein sequence, a feat that can currently not be accomplished with any other method.",M1
18551394,"Effects of trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid on gene expression and lipid metabolism of adipose tissue of growing pigs.The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in adipose tissue explant cultures of growing pigs on the following responses: lipogenesis (measured as rate of (14)C-labeled glucose incorporation over a subsequent 2-h incubation in the presence or absence of insulin), lipolysis (release of non-esterified fatty acid over a 2-h incubation in the presence or absence of isoproterenol), activities of lipogenic enzymes, and mRNA abundance of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). Adipose tissue explants from nine growing pigs (78 +/- 3 kg) were cultured in 199 medium with insulin, dexamethasone and antibiotics for 4, 12, 24, and 48 h. The treatments were 1) control: 100 microM polyvinyl alcohol (PVA); 2) pGH: 100 ng/mL porcine growth hormone (pGH) plus 100 microM PVA; 3) CLA200: 200 microM trans-10, cis-12 CLA; 4) CLA50: 50 microM trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and 5) LA: 200 microM linoleic acid. Fatty acids were added along with PVA (2:1), respectively, for 24 h. Explants were collected after each culture period and assayed for lipogenesis. Transcripts of FAS mRNA were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after 24 and 48 h. Lipolysis and activities of FAS, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and NADP-malate dehydrogenase were determined after 48 h. As expected, glucose incorporation was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in response to pGH treatment (positive control). LA had no effect on any parameter evaluated. Treatment with trans-10, cis-12 CLA decreased FAS activity (P &lt; 0.05), but NADPH-generating enzymes were unaffected by treatments. Consistent with reduction in FAS activity, both lipid synthesis and FAS mRNA abundance were reduced with chronic CLA treatment, pGH increased baseline and stimulated lipolysis (P &lt; 0.05) after 48 h of culture, while CLA treatment had no effect on non-esterified fatty acid release. Results of this study showed that trans-10, cis-12 CLA alters lipogenesis but has no effect on lipolysis in cultures of pig adipose tissue.",M1
18544973,"L-cysteine down-regulates SREBP-1c-regulated lipogenic enzymes expression via glutathione in HepG2 cells.BACKGROUND/AIM: Protein-associated amino acids are supposed to play a role in sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism. This study investigates the effects of cysteine on expression of SREBP-regulated hepatic genes. METHODS: HepG2 cells which are an accepted model for the study of the lipid metabolism were treated with L-cysteine under different conditions. RESULTS: Exposure of cells to L-cysteine reduced the mRNA concentrations of SREBP-1c (-35 to -43%) and its target genes fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>; -20 to -50%), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH; -31 to -35%), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD)1 (-34 to -50%). Cells treated with L-cysteine had 47% higher glutathione and 47% lower triglyceride concentrations than control cells. In cells which were concurrently treated with L-cysteine and L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of enzymatic glutathione synthesis, no down-regulation of the gene expression was observed. Pro-oxidant CuSO(4) up-regulated SREBP-1c (+71%), FAS (+165%), G6PDH (+84%) and SCD1 (+96%) mRNA abundance compared to control cells, but when cells were concurrently treated with L-cysteine, the gene expression remained at control level. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that L-cysteine rapidly down-regulates the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis via a mechanism that appears to be mediated by an improved glutathione status.",M1
18528705,"Differential expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and ErbB2 in nonmalignant and malignant oral keratinocytes.The aim of this study was to investigate fatty acid synthase (FAS) and ErbB2 expression in nonmalignant oral epithelium and oral or head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC/HNSCC). Morphologically normal, hyperkeratotic, and dysplastic oral epithelium as well as well-differentiated and poorly differentiated OSCC were immunohistochemically evaluated for FAS, ErbB2, and Ki-67. These proteins were also analyzed in a tissue microarray with 55 HNSCC. SCC-9 cells were used to study FAS and ErbB2 during differentiation. FAS expression was higher in hyperkeratosis, dysplasias, and OSCC than in normal epithelium. Well-differentiated OSCC/HNSCC were more positive for FAS than the poorly differentiated tumors. ErbB2 was observed at the surface of nonmalignant and well-differentiated OSCC/HNSCC keratinocytes and in the cytoplasm of poorly differentiated cells. Ki-67 index was progressively higher from normal oral epithelium to OSCC, inversely correlated with cell surface ErbB2, and positively correlated with intracytoplasmic ErbB2. Finally, SCC-9 cell cultures were enriched in membrane ErbB2-positive cells after differentiation by anchorage deprivation. In conclusion, FAS is overexpressed in OSCC/HNSCC and hyperkeratotic oral epithelium and ErbB2 is found at the cell surface of differentiating keratinocytes and in the cytoplasm of poorly differentiated tumor cells. Ki-67 index is higher in epithelial dysplasias and OSCC than in morphologically normal oral epithelium.",M1
18523653,"Saturated fatty acids modulate cell response to DNA damage: implication for their role in tumorigenesis.DNA damage triggers a network of signaling events that leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This DNA damage response acts as a mechanism to prevent cancer development. It has been reported that fatty acids (<e>FAs</e>) synthesis is increased in many human tumors while inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) could suppress tumor growth. Here we report that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) play a negative role in DNA damage response. Palmitic acid, as well as stearic acid and myristic acid, compromised the induction of p21 and Bax expression in response to double stranded breaks and ssDNA, while inhibition or knockdown of FASN enhanced these cellular events. SFAs appeared to regulate p21 and Bax expression via Atr-p53 dependent and independent pathways. These effects were only observed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and osteoblasts, but not in immortalized murine NIH3T3, or transformed HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines. Accordingly, SFAs showed some positive effects on proliferation of MEFs in response to DNA damage. These results suggest that SFAs, by negatively regulating the DNA damage response pathway, might promote cell transformation, and that increased synthesis of SFAs in precancer/cancer cells might contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance.",M1
18509688,"Farnesol decreases serum triglycerides in rats: identification of mechanisms including up-regulation of PPARalpha and down-regulation of fatty acid synthase in hepatocytes.Obesity is associated with impaired fatty acid (FA) oxidation and increased de novo hepatic lipogenesis that may contribute to the development of hypertriglyceridemia, an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Strategies to improve hepatocyte FA metabolism, including dietary interventions, are therefore important for the prevention of obesity-associated co-morbidities. Farnesol is consumed in the diet as a component of plant products. In the present study, we administered farnesol orally to rats for seven days and found significantly reduced serum triglyceride concentrations compared with controls. Potential mechanisms underlying the hypotriglyceridemic effect of farnesol were investigated using clone-9 cultured rat hepatocytes. Farnesol significantly upregulated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and the PPARalpha-regulated genes fatty acyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a, suggesting that increased hepatic FA oxidation may contribute to serum triglyceride lowering in rats. Farnesol did not change SREBP-1c mRNA levels, but significantly down-regulated fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) mRNA and protein levels and activity, indicating that attenuated lipogenesis may also contribute to hypotriglyceridemic effects of farnesol in vivo. Rescue experiments revealed that down-regulation of FAS by farnesol was not related to activation of PPARalpha, but rather was caused by a 9-cis retinoic acid mediated mechanism that involved down-regulation of retinoid X receptor beta. Diets rich in plant products are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Our findings suggest that farnesol may contribute to this protective effect by lowering serum TG levels.",M1
18460330,"Hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism mediates the orexigenic action of ghrelin.Current evidence suggests that hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism may play a role in regulating food intake; however, confirmation that it is a physiologically relevant regulatory system of feeding is still incomplete. Here, we use pharmacological and genetic approaches to demonstrate that the physiological orexigenic response to ghrelin involves specific inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis induced by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) resulting in decreased hypothalamic levels of malonyl-CoA and increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) activity. In addition, we also demonstrate that fasting downregulates fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in a region-specific manner and that this effect is mediated by an AMPK and ghrelin-dependent mechanisms. Thus, decreasing AMPK activity in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) is sufficient to inhibit ghrelin's effects on FAS expression and feeding. Overall, our results indicate that modulation of hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism specifically in the VMH in response to ghrelin is a physiological mechanism that controls feeding.",M1
18420801,"Activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase transcription by hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 2.Transcriptional factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) activates the transcription of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often associated with lipid accumulation within the liver, known as steatosis in the clinic. The molecular mechanisms of HCV-associated steatosis are not well characterized. Here, we showed that HCV non-structural protein 2 (NS2) activated SREBP-1c transcription in human hepatic Huh-7 cells as measured by using a human SREBP-1c promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. We further showed that sterol regulatory element (SRE) and liver X receptor element (LXRE) in the SREBP-1c promoter were involved in SREBP-1c activation by HCV NS2. Furthermore, expression of HCV NS2 resulted in the upregulation of FAS transcription. We also showed that FAS upregulation by HCV NS2 was SREBP-1-dependent since deleting the SRE sequence in a FAS promoter and expressing a dominant-negative SREBP-1 abrogated FAS promoter upregulation by HCV NS2. Taken together, our results suggest that HCV NS2 can upregulate the transcription of SREBP-1c and FAS, and thus is probably a contributing factor for HCV-associated steatosis.",M1
18413838,"Inhibiting fatty acid synthase for chemoprevention of chemically induced lung tumors.PURPOSE: Fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) is overexpressed in lung cancer, and we have investigated the potential use of FAS inhibitors for chemoprevention of lung cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of FAS was evaluated in preinvasive human lung lesions (bronchial squamous dysplasia and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia) and in murine models of lung tumorigenesis [4-(methylnitrosamino)-I-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced and urethane-induced lung tumors in A/J mice]. Then, the ability of pharmacologic inhibitors of FAS to prevent development of the murine tumors was investigated. Finally, the effect of the FAS inhibitor treatment of levels of phosphorylated Akt in the murine tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies show that human bronchial dysplasia and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia express high levels of FAS compared with normal lung tissues, suggesting that FAS might be a target for intervention in lung carcinogenesis. FAS is also expressed at high levels in chemically induced murine lung tumors, and the numbers and sizes of those murine tumors are significantly reduced by treating carcinogen-exposed mice with pharmacologic inhibitors of FAS, C75 and C93. C93 treatment is associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt in tumor tissues, suggesting that inhibition of this signal transduction pathway might be involved in the chemopreventative activity of this compound. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased levels of FAS are common in human preinvasive neoplasia of the lung. Based on studies in mouse models, it seems that inhibiting FAS is an effective strategy in preventing and retarding growth of lung tumors that have high expression of this enzyme.",M1
18410580,"Fatty acid synthase expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue: clinicopathological findings.BACKGROUND: Overexpression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), the cytosolic enzyme responsible for the conversion of dietary carbohydrates to fatty acids, has been reported in several human malignancies and pointed as a potential prognostic marker for some tumors. This study investigated whether FAS immunohistochemical expression is correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical features of 102 patients with OSCC of the tongue treated in a single institution were obtained from the medical records and all histopathological diagnoses were reviewed. The expression of FAS was determined by the standard immunoperoxidase technique in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens and correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors. RESULTS: Eighty-one cases (79.41%) were positive for FAS. Microscopic characteristics such as histological grade (P &lt; 0.05), lymphatic permeation (P &lt; 0.001), perineural infiltration (P &lt; 0.05), and nodal metastasis (P &lt; 0.02) were associated with FAS status. A significantly lower survival probability for patients with advanced clinical stage (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001), lymph nodes metastasis (log-rank test, P &lt; 0.001), presence of vascular permeation (log-rank test, P = 0.05), and perineural invasion (log-rank test, P = 0.01) was observed in the studied samples. CONCLUSION: The expression of FAS in OSCC of the tongue is associated with the microscopic characteristics that determine disease progression and prognosis.",M1
18410446,"Fatty acid synthase is a novel therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.This study investigated the biological significance of the inhibition of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in multiple myeloma (MM) using the small molecule inhibitor Cerulenin. Cerulenin triggered growth inhibition in both MM cell lines and MM patient cells, and overcame the survival and growth advantages conferred by interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-1, and bone marrow stromal cells. It induced apoptosis in MM cell lines with only modest activation of caspase -8, -9, -3 and PARP; moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not inhibit Cerulenin-induced apoptosis and cell death. In addition, treatment of MM cells with Cerulenin primarily up-regulated apoptosis-inducing factor/endonuclease G, mediators of caspase-independent apoptosis. Importantly, Cerulenin induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response via up-regulation of the Grp78/IRE1alpha/JNK pathway. Although the C-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600215 blocked Cerulenin-induced cytotoxicity, it did not inhibit apoptosis and caspase cleavage. Furthermore, Cerulenin showed synergistic cytotoxic effects with various agents including Bortezomib, Melphalan and Doxorubicin. Our results therefore indicate that inhibition of FAS by Cerulenin primarily triggered caspase-independent apoptosis and JNK-dependent cytotoxicity in MM cells. This report demonstrated that inhibition of FAS has anti-tumour activity against MM cells, suggesting that it represents a novel therapeutic target in MM.",M1
18410406,"Polyketides in insects: ecological role of these widespread chemicals and evolutionary aspects of their biogenesis.Polyketides are known to be used by insects for pheromone communication and defence against enemies. Although in microorganisms (fungi, bacteria) and plants polyketide biogenesis is known to be catalysed by polyketide synthases (PKS), no insect PKS involved in biosynthesis of pheromones or defensive compounds have yet been found. Polyketides detected in insects may also be biosynthesized by endosymbionts. From a chemical perspective, polyketide biogenesis involves the formation of a polyketide chain using carboxylic acids as precursors. Fatty acid biosynthesis also requires carboxylic acids as precursors, but utilizes fatty acid synthases (<e>FAS</e>) to catalyse this process. In the present review, studies of the biosynthesis of insect polyketides applying labelled carboxylic acids as precursors are outlined to exemplify chemical approaches used to elucidate insect polyketide formation. However, since compounds biosynthesised by FAS may use the same precursors, it still remains unclear whether the structures that are formed from e.g. acetate chains (acetogenins) or propanoate chains (propanogenins) are PKS or FAS products. A critical comparison of PKS and FAS architectures and activities supports the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin of these enzyme complexes and highlights why PKS can catalyse the biosynthesis of much more complex products than can FAS. Finally, we summarise knowledge which might assist researchers in designing approaches for the detection of insect PKS genes.",M1
18376827,"Fluorescent profiling of modular biosynthetic enzymes by complementary metabolic and activity based probes.The study of the enzymes responsible for natural product biosynthesis has proven a valuable source of new enzymatic activities and been applied to a number of biotechnology applications. Protein profiling could prove highly complementary to genetics based approaches by allowing us to understand the activity, transcriptional control, and post-translational modification of these enzymes in their native and dynamic proteomic environments. Here we present a method for the fluorescent profiling of PKS, NRPS, and <e>FAS</e> multidomain modular synthases in their whole proteomes using complementary metabolic and activity based probes. After first examining the reactivity of these activity based probes with a variety of purified recombinant PKS, NRPS, and FAS enzymes in vitro, we apply this duel labeling strategy to the analysis of modular synthases in a human breast cancer cell line and two strains of the natural product producer Bacillus subtilis. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that complementary protein profiling approaches can prove highly useful in the identification and assignment of inhibitor specificity and domain structure of these modular biosynthetic enzymes.",M1
18372237,"Adipose tissue loss in adjuvant arthritis is associated with a decrease in lipogenesis, but not with an increase in lipolysis.Adjuvant-induced arthritis is a model of rheumatoid arthritis that induces cachexia. In other cachectic situations, there is an increase in lipolysis resulting in a loss of adipose tissue mass. The aim of this work was to analyse the effect of chronic arthritis, induced by adjuvant injection, on white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, rats were killed 10 days after adjuvant injection, when the first external symptoms appeared, on days 15 and 22 when the external signs of the illness reach their severest level. As arthritis decreases food intake, a pair-fed group was also included. Serum concentrations of insulin, leptin, adiponectin, glycerol and nitrites, as well as gene expression of leptin, adiponectin, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>), tumour necrosis factor alpha and zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein (ZAG) were determined. Arthritis decreased food intake between days 5 and 16, but not during the last 5 days of the experiment. There was a marked decrease in relative adipose tissue weight and in serum leptin and adiponectin as well as in their gene expression in WAT in arthritic rats. Arthritis decreased the gene expression of FAS in the WAT. However, none of these effects was found in pair-fed rats. Arthritis did not increase lipolysis, since arthritic rats have lower serum concentrations of glycerol, HSL mRNA in WAT, as well as liver ZAG mRNA than the pair-fed or control rats. These data suggest that in chronic arthritis the decrease in white adipose mass is secondary to a reduced adipose lipogenesis, and this effect is not mainly due to the decrease in food intake.",M1
18369337,"Long-term effects of maternal magnesium restriction on adiposity and insulin resistance in rat pups.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the long-term effects of maternal/postnatal magnesium (Mg) restriction on adiposity, glucose tolerance, and insulin secretion in the offspring and the probable biochemical mechanisms associated with them. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Female weanling Wistar/NIN (WNIN) rats received a control diet or 70% Mg-restricted (MgR) diet for 9 weeks and mated with control males. A third of the restricted dams were shifted to control diet from parturition. Half of the pups born to the remaining restricted dams were weaned on to control diet, while the other half continued on MgR diet. Various parameters were determined in the offspring at 18 months of age. RESULTS: The percentage of body fat increased, lean body mass (LBM) and fat free mass (FFM) decreased in restricted offspring and were irreversible by rehabilitation. While glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (IR) were comparable among groups, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and basal glucose uptake by the diaphragm were significantly decreased in restricted offspring and not corrected by rehabilitation. Plasma leptin was lower, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was higher in restricted offspring, whereas expression of fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) and fatty acyl transport protein 1 (FATP 1) was higher in liver and adipose tissue. While changes in FAS and FATP 1 were not correctible by rehabilitation, those in leptin and TNF-alpha were corrected by rehabilitation from parturition but not from weaning. Tissue oxidative stress and antioxidant status were comparable among groups. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that maternal and postnatal Mg status is important in the long-term programming of body adiposity and insulin secretion in rat offspring.",M1
18359695,"[Expression of epidermal fatty acid-binding protein and fatty acid synthase in infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma]OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of epidermal fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) and fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) in human breast cancer and identify the potential markers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. METHODS: FAS and E-FABP expressions were detected in 76 patients with infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The possible associations of the expression of the two proteins with the major clinicopathological factors were analyzed. RESULTS: E-FABP and FAS expression levels were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) in grade III as compared with grades I and II infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma. There was a positive correlation between E-FABP and FAS expressions, but their expressions were not correlated to the clinicopathological factors of the patients except for the tumor grades. High E-FABP expression level in grades I and II tumors were associated with an early increased responsiveness to FAS. CONCLUSION: The variation of the E-FABP and FAS expressions in the lesions is associated with increase of the risk for breast cancer, and the results of this study provide evidence for developing new molecular markers of high-risk lesions and identifying new the targets for breast cancer therapy.",M1
18355682,"Examining the relationship between Cu-ATSM hypoxia selectivity and fatty acid synthase expression in human prostate cancer cell lines.INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with copper (II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-Methylthiosemicarbazone)(Cu-ATSM) for delineating hypoxia has provided valuable clinical information, but investigations in animal models of prostate cancer have shown some inconsistencies. As a defense mechanism in prostate cancer cells, the fatty acid synthesis pathway harnesses its oxidizing power for improving the redox balance despite conditions of extreme hypoxia, potentially altering Cu-ATSM hypoxia selectivity. METHODS: Human prostate tumor-cultured cell lines (PC-3, 22Rv1, LNCaP and LAPC-4), were treated with a fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) inhibitor (C75, 100 microM) under anoxia. The 64Cu-ATSM uptake in these treated cells and nontreated anoxic cells was then examined. Fatty acid synthase expression level in each cell line was subsequently quantified by ELISA. An additional study was performed in PC-3 cells to examine the relationship between the restoration of 64Cu-ATSM hypoxia selectivity and the concentration of C75 (100, 20, 4 or 0.8 microM) administered to the cells. RESULTS: Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis with C75 resulted in a significant increase in 64Cu-ATSM retention in prostate tumor cells in vitro under anoxia over 60 min. Inhibition studies demonstrated higher uptake values of 20.9+/-3.27%, 103.0+/-32.6%, 144.2+/-32.3% and 200.1+/-79.3% at 15 min over control values for LAPC-4, PC-3, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, respectively. A correlation was seen (R2=.911) with FAS expression plotted against percentage change in 64Cu-ATSM uptake with C75 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although Cu-ATSM has clinical relevance in the PET imaging of hypoxia in many tumor types, its translation to the imaging of prostate cancer may be limited by the overexpression of FAS associated with prostatic malignancies.",M1

18312417,"Discovery of GSK837149A, an inhibitor of human fatty acid synthase targeting the beta-ketoacyl reductase reaction.GSK837149A has been identified as a selective inhibitor of human fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>). The compound was first isolated as a minor impurity in a sample found to be active against the enzyme in a high-throughput screening campaign. The structure of this compound was confirmed by NMR and MS studies, and evaluation of the newly synthesized molecule confirmed its activity against FAS. The compound and other analogs synthesized, all being symmetrical structures containing a bisulfonamide urea, act by inhibiting the beta-ketoacyl reductase activity of the enzyme. GSK837149A inhibits FAS in a reversible mode, with a K(i) value of approximately 30 nm, and it possibly binds to the enzyme-ketoacyl-ACP complex. Although initial results suggest that cell penetration for these compounds is impaired, they still can be regarded as useful tools with which to probe and explore the beta-ketoacyl reductase active site in FAS, helping in the design of new inhibitors.",M1
18281474,"Fatty acid synthase gene is up-regulated by hypoxia via activation of Akt and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1.The fatty acid synthase (<e>FAS</e>) gene is significantly up-regulated in various types of cancers, and blocking the FAS expression results in apoptosis of tumor cells. Therefore, FAS is considered to be an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, the molecular mechanism by which the FAS gene is up-regulated in tumor cells is poorly understood. We found that FAS was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia, which was also accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in human breast cancer cell lines. The FAS expression was also activated by H(2)O(2), whereas N-acetyl-L-cystein, a ROS inhibitor, suppressed the expression. We also found that the hypoxia significantly up-regulated sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-1, the major transcriptional regulator of the FAS gene, via phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). Moreover, our results of reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicate that SREBP-1 strongly bound to the SREBP binding site/E-box sequence on the FAS promoter under hypoxia. In our xenograft mouse model, FAS was strongly expressed in the hypoxic regions of the tumor. In addition, our results of immunohistochemical analysis for human breast tumor specimens indicate that the expressions of both FAS and SREBP-1 were colocalized with hypoxic regions in the tumors. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cyclophosphamide was partially blocked by a combination of FAS inhibitor and cyclophosphamide. Taken together, our results indicate that FAS gene is up-regulated by hypoxia via activation of the Akt and HIF1 followed by the induction of the SREBP-1 gene, and that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is partly due to the up-regulation of FAS.",M1
20385628,"Prenatal alcohol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children adopted from eastern Europe.OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this investigation were to determine the frequencies of and associations between different neurodevelopmental disorders and to study the potential lasting effects of alcohol on children adopted from eastern Europe. METHODS: In a population-based, prospective, observational, multidisciplinary, cross-sectional, cohort study of 71 children adopted from eastern Europe, children were assessed 5 years after adoption, from pediatric, neuropsychological, and ophthalmologic perspectives. RESULTS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, that is, fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), partial FAS, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, were identified for 52% of children; FAS was found for 30%, partial FAS for 14%, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders for 9%. Alcohol-related birth defects were found for 11% of children, all of whom also were diagnosed as having FAS. Mental retardation or significant cognitive impairment was found for 23% of children, autism for 9%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder for 51%, and developmental coordination disorder for 34%. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders were common in this long-term follow-up study of children adopted from orphanages in eastern Europe. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has long-lasting adverse effects, causing structural, behavioral, and cognitive damage despite a radically improved environment.",M2
20335648,"Profile of the first 1,400 patients receiving diagnostic evaluations for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder at the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic &amp; Prevention Network.BACKGROUND: An interdisciplinary approach to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) diagnosis using rigorously defined diagnostic guidelines has been adopted as best practice. Diagnostic clinics are being established worldwide. If these clinics are to successfully compete for limited health care dollars, it is essential to document their value. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives were to document the value of the largest and longest standing interdisciplinary FASD diagnostic program; the Washington State Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic &amp; Prevention Network (WA <e>FAS</e> DPN). Now in its 17th year of operation, the WA FAS DPN is a statewide network of diagnostic clinics all using the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code and contributing to a centralized electronic database. METHODS: The clinical database was used to generate comprehensive profiles of all patients evaluated for FASD from 1993-2005. These profiles were used to answer a multitude of clinical, research, and public health questions including: What is the demand for FASD diagnostic services, who is referred to the clinics, and what are their FASD diagnostic outcomes? Can FAS/D prevalence estimates from this clinical population be used to estimate FAS/D prevalence estimates in the general population? Do FASD diagnostic outcomes vary by race, age or alcohol exposure? Does the presence of other adverse exposures/events lead to more severe outcomes? Does this approach to diagnosis meet the needs of families? RESULTS: Demand for diagnosis remains very high. Of 1,400 patients (newborn to adult) with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure, 11% were diagnosed with FAS/PFAS, 28% with static encephalopathy, 52% with neurobehavioral disorder, and 9% with no evidence of CNS abnormality. FASD outcomes varied significantly by age, race, gender, alcohol exposure, and presence of other risk factors. Families reported high satisfaction with the diagnostic process, and receipt of information/services they were unable to obtain elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: This report documents the immense contribution of a statewide FASD diagnostic program, and underscores the extraordinary value of a comprehensive FASD clinical dataset.",M2
20147771,"Normal distribution of palpebral fissure lengths in Canadian school age children.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) includes the facial dysmorphic feature of short palpebral fissures (PFs) and short PFs are a key physical marker for identifying children with FAS and some other rarer conditions. There is concern that normative data on PFs now available may not reflect all racial/ethnic groups and might be inaccurate in general. OBJECTIVES: To accomplish a large population based study that would accurately determine normative PF values across the full diversity of the Canadian school age population. METHODS: A normative sample of school age children was identified in Vancouver, British Columbia and Winnipeg, Manitoba to reflect the diversity of racial and national groups in Canada. The sample included students in grades 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 from 17 schools in Vancouver and 31 schools in Winnipeg. Schools were selected based on racial diversity obtained from data from the 2001 Statistics Canada census. 1064 students in Vancouver and 1033 students in Winnipeg were photographed in a standardized way. Photographs were analyzed using a computerized method. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated that PFs do grow with age and there is a slight but meaningful difference between boys and girls in each age group. It is possible to define Canadian standards without reference to racial or ethnic origin. CONCLUSION: Mean results with norms and standard deviations are presented in figures for clinical use and are clinically smaller than those found in the most commonly used reference book.",M2

In the FAS group, verbal IQ (VIQ=78), performance IQ (PIQ=77), and full scale IQ (FSIQ=75) were significantly lower as compared to the FAE and PDE groups. In the PDE group VIQ and FSIQ were significantly higher than in the FAE group. In the FAS group, processing speed (PS) was significantly lower than the other three factors. In the FAE group, perceptual organization (PO) was significantly higher, whereas PS was significantly lower than the other factors. In the PDE group, verbal comprehension (VC) was significantly higher than the other factors. Attention subscales on the NEPSY were significantly lower in all the three groups. Prenatal alcohol exposure affects IQ levels more than exposure to psychotropic drugs. Attentional problems were found in all children when tested with the NEPSY in all groups.",M2

Digital facial imaging methods are increasingly being used in syndrome delineation. Distance measurements derived from stereo-photogrammetry and facial surface imaging have been used to study the FAS facial anomalies. Geometric morphometric methods capture the spatial arrangement between landmarks, providing a statistical platform for comparison of facial shapes, and have been shown to hold promise for characterizing the FAS facial shape. We review the progression in the use of imaging and image analysis methods in studies on the facial phenotype associated with FAS.",M2
20080394,"Cingulate gyrus morphology in children and adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a variety of cognitive and other birth defects, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and including the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). This study examined the impact of gestational alcohol exposure on the morphology of the cingulate gyrus, given this region's role in cognitive control, attention, and emotional regulation, all of which are affected in children with FASD. Thirty-one youth (ages 8-16) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (n=21) and demographically matched comparison subjects (n=10) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. The cingulate gyrus was manually delineated, and parcellated volumes of grey and white matter were compared across groups. Alcohol-exposed individuals had significantly smaller raw cingulate grey matter, white matter, and tissue volumes compared with controls. After adjustment for respective cranial tissue constituents, only white matter volumes remained significantly reduced, and this held regardless of whether or not the child qualified for a diagnosis of FAS. A correlation between posterior cingulate grey matter volume and the WISC-III Freedom from Distractibility Index was also observed in alcohol-exposed children. These data suggest that cingulate white matter is compromised beyond global white matter hypoplasia in alcohol-exposed individuals, regardless of FAS diagnosis. The observed volumetric reductions in the cingulate gyrus may contribute to the disruptive and emotionally dysregulated behavioral profile commonly observed in this population.",M2
20014122,"Morphometric analysis and classification of the facial phenotype associated with fetal alcohol syndrome in 5- and 12-year-old children.Landmark-based morphometric analysis holds promise for quantitative assessment of craniofacial dysmorphology. We describe an application of facial shape analysis to characterize the facial anomalies associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) in a mixed ancestry population. Generalized Procrustes analysis, regression and discriminant function analysis were applied to stereo-photogrammetrically derived 3D coordinates of landmarks taken from 34 subjects (n = 17 FAS and n = 17 normal controls). Four shape analyses were carried out, namely a comparison of the FAS and control facial shapes at age 5, and one at age 12; a comparison of the FAS facial shapes at ages 5 and 12; and a comparison of control facial shapes at ages 5 and 12. The first two analyses showed that the FAS face is characterized by small palpebral fissures, a thin upper lip, and midfacial hypoplasia. Classification of subjects as having FAS using leave-one-out cross-validation showed that the 5-year-old group could be classified with 95.46% accuracy and the 12-year-olds with 80.13% accuracy. The third and fourth analyses revealed that the differences in facial shape between FAS individuals in different age groups were more pronounced than for control individuals, supporting the notion that FAS facial anomalies diminish with age. Geometric morphometric analysis of stereo-photogrammetrically derived 3D facial landmarks allows visualization of the facial anomalies associated with FAS, as well as classification of facial shapes.",M2

19926894,"Physical and neurodevelopmental evaluation of children adopted from Eastern Europe.BACKGROUND: Children adopted from Eastern Europe are at risk of prenatal alcohol exposure, consequently at risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). To our knowledge, a systematic complete assessment of these disabilities among adoptees from Eastern Europe has not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To assess physical and neurodevelopmental status to identify FASD in children adopted from Eastern Europe. METHOD: Cross sectional study at International Adoption Clinic of a paediatric academic hospital. This evaluation was realized according to the 4-Digit Diagnostic Code (4-DDC). RESULTS: Twenty-nine children were evaluated. Five years after adoption, 7% (N=2) still presented growth delay and 24% (N=7) microcephaly. Facial evaluation demonstrated moderate Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) features in 7% (N=2) of children. Amiel-Tison Neurological Assessment was non optimal in 46% (N=13/28) of children. Visual-motor perception skills were mainly normal, but 14% (N=4) showed distal somatopraxic problems. Cognition, executive functioning, abstract reasoning and memory were normal. Full scale IQ was 105.5 +/- 13.3; verbal IQ &lt; performance IQ (p&lt;0.005), work memory &lt; short memory (p&lt;0.0001), receptive &lt;expressive language (p&lt;0.0001).

Concerning adaptive behaviour, social skills and social communication, 29% (N=8) performed &lt;-2 SD and 33% (N=5/15) needed school assistance. According to 4-DDC, 7% (N=2) of children were normal, 21% (N=6) of children were known exposed to alcohol, one of these was classified as Partial FAS and five others presented neurological damage, or neurobehavioral disorders with or without sentinel physical findings. Three percent (N=1) were classified FAS although alcohol exposure was unknown. Sixty-nine percent (N=20) of children presented physical findings alone or neurological anomalies with or without physical findings. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the 4-DDC was useful. Systematic and multidisciplinary neurodevelopmental assessment is needed in these adopted children, for an early intervention to prevent secondary disabilities and therefore optimize children's outcome.",M2

This study included a sample of urban schoolchildren attending 1st to 4th grade elementary school and their mothers. Out of 912 mothers, 575 (63.04%) participated in the interview. Prenatal alcohol consumption was admitted by 15.47% and binge drinking by 3.13% of interviewed mothers. We evaluated 466 (51.09%) schoolchildren for signs of FAS or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) using revised Institute of Medicine (IOM) diagnostic criteria. Nineteen students had features consistent with FAS or PFAS. The observed prevalence of FAS is 3 children and of PFAS is 16 children among 466 students, based on 51% participation rate. The estimated prevalence of FAS is 6.44/1000, of PFAS 34.33/1000 and overall prevalence of FAS/PFAS 40.77/1000. This is the first study of FAS prevalence in Croatia and as far as we are aware the second study in Europe.",M2
19768741,"Atypical functional lateralization in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.In order to explore effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on functional lateralization, item tasks measuring preferences of hand, foot, eye, and ear were administered to a sample of 23 children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) compared with typically developing (TD) children. In addition, a dichotic listening task was administered to a subsample of 11 children with FAS and a TD group of comparable age, sex and handedness. The children with FAS were characterized by increased nonright-handedness compared with TD children. No differences were evident for preferential use of foot, eye, or ear. Moreover, children with FAS displayed more right ear extinctions during dichotic listening relative to TD children, indicating a lack of right ear advantage. The results add to findings of decreased manual asymmetry and less left-lateralized speech perception in children with developmental disorders, and are further discussed in relation to the high incidence of callosal abnormalities in alcohol-exposed children.",M2
19764076,"Polymicrogyria in fetal alcohol syndrome.BACKGROUND: Intrauterine exposure to alcohol may result in a distinct pattern of craniofacial abnormalities and central nervous system dysfunction, designated fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). The spectrum of malformations of the brain associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy is much broader than the relatively uniform clinical phenotype of FAS. Among these malformations the most striking abnormalities involve the impairment of neuronal cell migration. However, polymicrogyria (PMG) has so far been reported only once in a human autopsy study of a child with FAS. CASE: A 16-year-old girl with confirmed maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and full phenotype of FAS presented after two generalized epileptic seizures for neurologic assessment. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral PMG in the superior frontal gyrus with asymmetric distribution. History, clinical features, and genetic investigations provided no evidence for any of the known genetic or acquired causes of PMG. Therefore, we propose that prenatal alcohol exposure is the cause of PMG in this patient rather than a mere coincidence. CONCLUSION: Our observation represents only the second patient of PMG in FAS and confirms the phenotypic variability of cerebral malformations associated with maternal alcohol abuse during pregnancy. In patients with clinical features of FAS and neurologic deficits or seizures neuroimaging is recommended. Furthermore, FAS should be considered as a differential diagnosis for PMG.",M2
19731386,"Psychiatric conditions associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) over 35 years ago, mounting evidence about the impact of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has prompted increased attention to the link between prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and a constellation of developmental disabilities that are characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. These disabilities include a continuum of developmental disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Longitudinal studies suggest that individuals with FASDs are at a greatly increased risk for adverse long-term outcomes, including mental health problems and poor social adjustment. This review summarizes the existing literature on mental health outcomes for individuals with PAE across the lifespan, including findings in infancy and early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence and early adulthood. Research on the psychiatric disabilities suffered by individuals with FASDs throughout development highlights the need for training of mental health professionals in the identification and the provision of specific treatments to address the unique features of this developmental disability since early identification and treatment have been demonstrated to be protective against more serious secondary disabilities. It is hoped that with greater awareness of the mental health problems experienced by individuals with FASDs, these individuals can receive appropriate and early treatment resulting in more adaptive and rewarding lives.",M2
19731384,"Prevalence and epidemiologic characteristics of FASD from various research methods with an emphasis on recent in-school studies.Researching the epidemiology and estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and other fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) for mainstream populations anywhere in the world has presented a challenge to researchers. Three major approaches have been used in the past: surveillance and record review systems, clinic-based studies, and active case ascertainment methods. The literature on each of these methods is reviewed citing the strengths, weaknesses, prevalence results, and other practical considerations for each method. Previous conclusions about the prevalence of FAS and total FASD in the United States (US) population are summarized. Active approaches which provide clinical outreach, recruitment, and diagnostic services in specific populations have been demonstrated to produce the highest prevalence estimates. We then describe and review studies utilizing in-school screening and diagnosis, a special type of active case ascertainment. Selected results from a number of in-school studies in South Africa, Italy, and the US are highlighted. The particular focus of the review is on the nature of the data produced from in-school methods and the specific prevalence rates of FAS and total FASD which have emanated from them. We conclude that FAS and other FASD are more prevalent in school populations, and therefore the general population, than previously estimated. We believe that the prevalence of FAS in typical, mixed-racial, and mixed-socioeconomic populations of the US is at least 2 to 7 per 1,000. Regarding all levels of FASD, we estimate that the current prevalence of FASD in populations of younger school children may be as high as 2-5% in the US and some Western European countries.",M2
19731383,"Intervention for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: treatment approaches and case management.Exposure to alcohol in utero is considered to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities of known etiology. The most severe consequence of such exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), is characterized by a distinct constellation of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Some individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) do not meet the full criteria for FAS, but instead are diagnosed with partial FAS, alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), or alcohol related birth defects (ARBD). The entire continuum of effects from PAE is increasingly being referred to under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). An extensive body of research has documented major cognitive, behavioral, adaptive, social, and emotional impairments among individuals with FASDs. Although FAS was identified in the U.S. over 35 years ago, the development, evaluation, and dissemination of evidence-based interventions for individuals with FASDs have lagged behind significantly. Encouragingly, however, in recent years there has been a marked increase in efforts to design and test interventions to remediate the impairments associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. This article will review treatment needs and considerations for individuals with FASDs and their families, current empirically tested treatment approaches, case management issues, and suggestions for future directions in research on the treatment of FASDs.",M2
19719791,"The effects of fetal alcohol syndrome on response execution and inhibition: an event-related potential study.BACKGROUND: Both executive function deficits and slower processing speed are characteristic of children with fetal alcohol exposure, but the temporal dynamics of neural activity underlying cognitive processing deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder have rarely been studied. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the nature of alcohol-related effects on response inhibition by identifying differences in neural activation during task performance. METHODS: We recorded ERPs during a Go/No-go response inhibition task in 2 groups of children in Cape Town, South Africa (M age = 11.7 years; range = 10 to 13)-one diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) or partial FAS (FAS/PFAS; n = 7); the other, a control group whose mothers abstained or drank only minimally during pregnancy (n = 6). Children were instructed to press a  Go  response button to all letter stimuli presented except for the letter  X,  the  No-go  stimulus, which occurred relatively infrequently. RESULTS: Task performance accuracy and reaction time did not differ between groups, but differences emerged for 3 ERP components-P2, N2, and P3. The FAS/PFAS group showed a slower latency to peak P2, suggesting less efficient processing of visual information at a relatively early stage ( approximately 200 ms after stimulus onset). Moreover, controls showed a larger P2 amplitude to Go versus No-go, indicating an early discrimination between conditions that was not seen in the FAS/PFAS group. Consistent with previous literature on tasks related to cognitive control, the control group showed a well-defined, larger N2 to No-go versus Go, which was not evident in the FAS/PFAS group. Both groups showed the expected larger P3 amplitude to No-go versus Go, but this condition difference persisted in a late slow wave for the FAS/PFAS group, suggesting increased cognitive effort. CONCLUSIONS: The timing and amplitude differences in the ERP measures suggest that slower, less efficient processing characterizes the FAS/PFAS group during initial stimulus identification. Moreover, the exposed children showed less sharply defined components throughout the stimulus and response evaluation processes involved in successful response inhibition. Although both groups were able to inhibit their responses equally well, the level of neural activation in the children with FAS/PFAS was greater, suggesting more cognitive effort. The specific deficits in response inhibition processing at discrete stages of neural activation may have implications for understanding the nature of alcohol-related deficits in other cognitive domains as well.",M2
19683904,"[Alcohol and pregnancy]Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a major cause of mental retardation in Western countries. Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is mainly characterized by pre- and postnatal stunted growth, neurocognitive disorders, and facial dysmorphism.

Prevention tools exist, through better information of health professionals, for optimal care of high-risk women before, during, and after pregnancy, which would decrease the incidence of SAF in the future.",M2
19645729,"Microstructural corpus callosum anomalies in children with prenatal alcohol exposure: an extension of previous diffusion tensor imaging findings.BACKGROUND: Several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in comparison with nonexposed controls. The data suggest that posterior regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. The current study builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline corpus callosum to probe major inter-hemispheric white matter pathways with an improved DTI tractographic method. This study also expands on our prior work by evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of clinical effects including full-criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). METHODS: Participants included 33 children with FASD (8 FAS, 23 partial FAS, 2 static encephalopathy) and 19 nonexposed controls between the ages of 10 and 17 years. Participants underwent DTI scans and intelligence testing. Groups (FASD vs. controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in 6 white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. Exploratory analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between DTI measures in the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial dysmorphology. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the FASD group had significantly lower FA in 3 posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the posterior mid-body, the isthmus, and the splenium. A trend-level finding also suggested lower FA in the genu. Measures of white matter integrity and cognition were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual-perceptual skills. Correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous DTI studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and cognitive impairment. These abnormalities are clinically relevant because they are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic features. As such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information not provided by the traditional facial characteristics.",M2
19572986,"Magnetic resonance imaging outcomes from a comprehensive magnetic resonance study of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. METHODS: A comprehensive neuropsychological/psychiatric battery, coupled with MR imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) assessments, were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The 4 study groups included: (i) fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>)/partial FAS (PFAS); (ii) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (iii) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (iv) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Presented here are the MRI assessments that were used to compare the sizes of brain regions between the 4 groups. The neuropsychological/behavioral, MRS, and fMRI outcomes are reported separately. RESULTS: Progressing across the 4 study groups from Controls to ND/AE to SE/AE to FAS/PFAS, the mean absolute size of the total brain, frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum length decreased incrementally and significantly. The FAS/PFAS group (the only group with the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype) had disproportionately smaller frontal lobes relative to all other groups. The FAS/PFAS and SE/AE groups [the 2 groups with the most severe central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction] had disproportionately smaller caudate regions relative to the ND/AE and Control groups. The prevalence of subjects in the FAS/PFAS, SE/AE, and ND/AE groups that had 1 or more brain regions, 2 or more SDs below the mean size observed in the Control group was 78, 58, and 43%, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between size of brain regions and level of prenatal alcohol exposure, magnitude of FAS facial phenotype, and level of CNS dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging provided further validation that ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS as defined by the FASD 4-Digit Code are 3 clinically distinct and increasingly more affected diagnostic subclassifications under the umbrella of FASD. Neurostructural abnormalities are present across the spectrum. MRI could importantly augment diagnosis of conditions under the umbrella of FASD, once population-based norms for structural development of the human brain are established.",M2
19571480,"Intrauterine environment-genome interaction and children's development (1): Ethanol: a teratogen in developing brain.Exposure to ethanol during prenatal development can have devastating consequences on developing fetuses, the so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disordres (FASD). Among FASD, cases that exhibit all of three criterion; 1) central nervous system dysfunction, 2) prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, and 3) characteristic cranial/facial abnormalities, referred as fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). Children born to drinking mothers may suffer from severe brain damage that is expressed by a variety of behavioral alterations. We examined the effects of ethanol exposure during brain development on brain morphogenesis and circadian rhythm using a rat model. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a liquid diet containing 2.5-5.0% (w/v) ethanol during gestational days 10 to 21. Mean daily ethanol consumption by these dams was 11.53 +/- 2.54 g/kg/day. In rats prenatally exposed to ethanol, ectopias on the cerebral cortex, aberrant distribution of hippocampal mossy fibers, and fusion of cerebellar folia were found. Rats exposed to ethanol during the prenatal or postnatal period suffered from a fragile synchronizing system of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Although the prevalence of FAS in Japan is lower than in the United States, the increasing number of Japanese women with the drinking habit are cause for great concern. However, the preventive action of FAS/FASD has been advanced recently, and now alcoholic beverages carry labels warning of the risk of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding of babies. Although little is still known about how ethanol affects brain development, the only and most certain way to prevent FAS/FASD is total abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",M2
19480273,"Hospitalizations of children who have fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome.INTRODUCTION: The study describes the hospitalization rates and medical diagnoses of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and incomplete FAS. METHODS: Two retrospective case-control studies were conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with FAS or incomplete FAS identified from 1981-93 by using the ICD-9-CM code 760.71. Children who had FAS or incomplete FAS were compared to each other and to children who did not have FAS. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, the 43 children with FAS (Study 1) and 35 children with incomplete FAS (Study 2) were hospitalized more often with otitis media (51.2 percent OR=4.32 and 31.4 percent OR=3.02 respectively), pneumonia (46.5 percent OR=4.21 and 34.3 percent OR=2.54), fetal alcohol syndrome (32.6 percent p=.001 and 14.3 percent p=.007), dehydration (23.3 percent OR=9.29 and 17.1 percent OR=4), and anemia (11.6 percent OR=10 and 17.1 percent p=.002) respectively. Children with FAS were hospitalized more often with failure to thrive (32.6 percent p=.001) and neglect (23.3 percent OR=10.0) than children with incomplete FAS and controls. Children with FAS were hospitalized with child sexual abuse (11.6 percent OR=10.0) and feeding problems (11.6 percent p=.007), and children with incomplete FAS were hospitalized with gastroenteritis (22.9 percent OR=14.55) and bronchitis (22.9 percent OR=3.0) more than control children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with FAS or incomplete FAS had more hospitalizations and longer average length of stays than control children.",M2
19372601,"Concordance of three methods for palpebral fissure length measurement in the assessment of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.BACKGROUND: The assessment of individuals at risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) includes the assessment of the craniofacial features that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure. The characteristic facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) consist of short palpebral fissures, smooth or flattened philtrum, and thin vermilion border of the upper lip. There are various methods for measuring palpebral fissure lengths (PFLs) and it can be challenging for clinicians to obtain reproducibly accurate measurements. The development of the FAS Facial Photographic Analysis Software by the University of Washington FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network (DPN) is one such means of improving the accuracy and reproducibility in these measurements. OBJECTIVES: To assess concordance across three methods of PFL measurement: 1) a clear plastic handheld ruler, 2) blunt precision slide calipers, and 3) digital photometric photography (FAS Facial Photographic Analysis Software). METHODS: The PFLs of 50 children (referred to the Clinic for Alcohol and Drug Exposed Children, CADEC) at Children's Hospital in Winnipeg and 50 adults from the University of Manitoba Medical Class of 2008 were measured once by a single clinician, using each of the three methods. The frequency and magnitude of discordance was tabulated. No method served as a gold-standard. RESULTS: The PFLs ranged from 20 to 32 mm. The ruler and photometric measures were concordant in 42% of the subjects. When measures were discordant, half the ruler measures were larger and half were smaller. The caliper measure was concordant with the photometric and ruler measures on 18% and 24% of the subjects, respectively. When measures were discordant, the caliper measures were almost always larger than the photometric and ruler method (0.5 to 2.5 mm larger, 83% and 95% of the time, respectively). The presence of epicanthal folds did not appear to be a factor that contributed to discordance. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the challenge in measuring the PFL, even when a single trained clinician is involved. Factors that can contribute to error include the subject's willingness to cooperate, ability to tolerate placement of the tool close enough to the eye to obtain an accurate measure, and precision of the tool. When controlling for the clinician performing the measurements and the quality of the photographs, the ruler and photometric measures were most concordant. The caliper measures tended to measure larger than the ruler and photometric measures.",M2
19367219,"Neurologic and ophthalmic manifestations of fetal alcohol syndrome.Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is a leading cause of preventable birth defects and developmental disability with numerous neurologic and ophthalmic manifestations. FAS is identified by the presence of a characteristic facies, growth deficiency, and central nervous system abnormalities. A wide variety of ocular and neuro-ophthalmic conditions occur in FAS and result in lifelong visual impairment. Neurologists are frequently called upon to evaluate and recommend treatment for children with developmental delay or neurologic manifestations of FAS. We review the neuro-ophthalmic literature on FAS to alert neurologists to the ocular disease seen in patients with this condition. Timely ophthalmic referral and early intervention for treatable ophthalmic conditions, such as refractive errors, strabismus, and amblyopia, can prevent irreparable harm to the developing visual system and improve the overall neurologic development, long-term functioning, and quality of life for these patients.",M2
19350654,"Developmental pathogenesis of short palpebral fissure length in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.BACKGROUND: From the standpoint of normal embryologic development, the palpebral fissures are generally considered to be determined by and dependent on the underlying optic vesicles, outpouchings of the frontal area of the developing fetal brain. It has been suggested that short palpebral fissures are a reflection of an underlying defect in specific areas of forebrain development. Alternatively, short palpebral fissures, seen in a number of multiple malformation syndromes associated with small occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), such as the fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), might be proportionally small as a reflection of the microcephaly. The purpose of this study was to examine whether short palpebral fissures are independent of or determined by the OFC. METHODS: Age-specific palpebral fissure length (PFL) and OFC centiles were correlated in 273 children with FAS, 272 children with some features of FAS, and 385 children with no structural features characteristic of FAS. RESULTS: The OFC and PFL centiles demonstrated a statistically significant but weak correlation in all three study groups. Among children with FAS, only 10.2% of the total variation in PFL could be accounted for by OFC (p = 0.0001). A similar pattern was observed for children with some features of FAS (r(2) = 0.142; p = 0.0001) and children with no structural features of FAS (r(2) = 0.110; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Palpebral fissure length is predominately independent of occipitofrontal circumference in children with and without features of FAS. Short palpebral fissures may well reflect a defect in forebrain development rather than being proportionally reduced in size as a reflection of microcephaly. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 2009.

19342189,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy outcomes from a comprehensive magnetic resonance study of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.Magnetic resonance (MR) technology offers noninvasive methods for in vivo assessment of neuroabnormalities. A comprehensive neuropsychological/behavioral, MR imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) assessment was administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine whether global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified and to distinguish diagnostic subclassifications across the spectrum. The four study groups included (1) <e>FAS</e>/partial FAS; (2) static encephalopathy/alcohol exposed (SE/AE); (3) neurobehavioral disorder/alcohol exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed with the FASD 4-Digit Code; and (4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol exposure. Results are presented in four separate reports: MRS (reported here) and neuropsychological/behavioral, MRI and fMRI outcomes (reported separately). MRS was used to compare neurometabolite concentrations [choline (Cho), n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatine (Cre)] in a white matter region and a hippocampal region between the four study groups. Choline concentration in the frontal/parietal white matter region, lateral to the midsection of the corpus callosum, was significantly lower in FAS/PFAS relative to all other study groups. Choline decreased significantly with decreasing frontal white matter volume and corpus callosum length. These outcomes suggest low choline concentrations may reflect white matter deficits among FAS/PFAS. Choline also decreased significantly with increasing severity of the 4-Digit FAS facial phenotype, increasing impairment in psychological performance and increasing alcohol exposure. NAA and Cre concentrations did not vary significantly. This study provides further evidence of the vulnerability of the cholinergic system in FASD.",M2

We describe such a system for use in obtaining 3-D facial information in infants. The infant is photographed using three high resolution digital cameras simultaneously while seated in a car seat. The subject's head is enclosed in a control frame during imaging. Technical system tests, namely control frame interpolation, camera calibration reliability, and camera synchronization delay assessments were performed. Direct and stereo-photogrammetric measurements of a doll were compared. Of 275 inter-landmark distances, 100% were within a 1.5 mm error range and 92.36% within a 1 mm error range when the two modalities were compared. Stereo-photogrammetry proved to be highly precise with submillimeter error in landmark placement for all landmarks on the doll. An intra-modality comparison of inter-landmark distances using two sets of images of five subjects showed the stereo-photogrammetric system to be highly reliable, with an average 72.25% of distances within a 1 mm error range. The system has potential for large scale screening and surveillance studies for FAS.",M2
19329824,"Neuropyschological and behavioral outcomes from a comprehensive magnetic resonance study of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.BACKGROUND: Clinical and research advancements in the field of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) require accurate and valid identification of FASD clinical subgroups. OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery, coupled with magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI) were administered to children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to determine if global and/or focal abnormalities could be identified across the spectrum, and distinguish diagnostic subclassifications within the spectrum. The neuropsychological outcomes of the comprehensive neuroimaging study are presented here. METHODS: The study groups included: 1) <e>FAS</e>/Partial FAS; 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol Exposed (SE/AE); 3) Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol Exposed (ND/AE) as diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team using the FASD 4-Digit Code; and 4) healthy peers with no prenatal alcohol. A standardized neuropsychological battery was administered to each child and their primary caregiver by a psychologist. RESULTS: Use of the 4-Digit Code produced three clinically and statistically distinct FASD clinical subgroups. The three subgroups (ND/AE, SE/AE and FAS/PFAS) reflected a linear continuum of increasing neuropsychological impairment and physical abnormality, representing the full continuum of FASD. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were comparably prevalent across the three FASD groups, and significantly more prevalent than among the Controls. All three FASD subgroups had comparably high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although ND/AE, SE/AE, and FAS/PFAS are distinct FASD subgroups, these groups are not distinguishable solely by their neuropsychological profiles. While all children within a group shared the same magnitude of neuropsychological impairment, the patterns of impairment showed considerable individual variability. MRI, MRS and fMRI further distinguished these FASD subgroups.",M2
19302166,"Oculomotor control in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders assessed using a mobile eye-tracking laboratory.Prenatal exposure to alcohol can result in a spectrum of adverse developmental outcomes, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). This study evaluated deficits in sensory, motor and cognitive processing in children with FASD that can be identified using eye movement testing. Our study group was composed of 89 children aged 8-15 years with a diagnosis within the FASD spectrum [i.e. fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND)], and 92 controls. Subjects looked either towards (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a peripheral target that appeared on a computer monitor, and eye movements were recorded with a mobile, video-based eye tracker. We hypothesized that: (i) differences in the magnitude of deficits in eye movement control exist across the three diagnostic subgroups; and (ii) children with FASD display a developmental delay in oculomotor control. Children with FASD had increased saccadic reaction times (SRTs), increased intra-subject variability in SRTs, and increased direction errors in both the prosaccade and antisaccade tasks. Although development was associated with improvements across tasks, children with FASD failed to achieve age-matched control levels of performance at any of the ages tested. Moreover, children with ARND had faster SRTs and made fewer direction errors in the antisaccade task than children with pFAS or FAS, although all subgroups were different from controls. Our results demonstrate that eye tracking can be used as an objective measure of brain injury in FASD, revealing behavioral deficits in all three diagnostic subgroups independent of facial dysmorphology.",M2
19278010,"Voxelwise and skeleton-based region of interest analysis of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in young adults.Though fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are among the most common developmental disorders, their understanding is incomplete. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which is sensitive to microstructural organization in white matter, may provide a relevant measure in this population demonstrating incompletely characterized white matter pathology. In this study, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) routine and a skeleton-based region of interest analyses were employed to detect differences in DTI-derived metrics between young adults who were alcohol exposed and an unexposed control group. Participants include 28 with dysmorphic features associated with FAS, 29 who were prenatally exposed but do not show physical effects, and 25 with the same low socioeconomic status but unexposed. The TBSS analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in fractional anisotropy at the isthmus of the corpus callosum and its connected callosal fibers in dysmorphic individuals relative to controls (clusterwise P(FWE) &lt; 0.05). This finding was consistent with that of the follow-up skeleton-based region of interest analysis (F((2,79)) = 3.256, p = 0.044). In addition, the patterns in axial and radial diffusivity changes suggest that demyelination may be associated with the degraded white matter integrity observed in the dysmorphic group.",M2
19251116,"Effect of gestational ethanol exposure on parvalbumin and calretinin expressing hippocampal neurons in a chick model of fetal alcohol syndrome.Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), a condition occurring in some children of mothers who have consumed alcohol during pregnancy, is characterized by physical deformities and learning and memory deficits. The chick hippocampus, whose functions are controlled by interneurons expressing calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR), is involved in learning and memory mechanisms. Effects on growth and development and hippocampal morphology were studied in chick embryos exposed to 5% and 10% ethanol volume/volume (vol/vol) for 2 or 8 days of gestation. There was a significant dose-dependent reduction (P&lt;.05) in body weight and mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons in ethanol-exposed chicks, without alterations in neuronal nuclear size or hippocampal volume, compared appropriate controls. Moreover, when chicks exposed to 5% ethanol for 2 and 8 days of gestation were compared, no significant differences were found in body parameters or neuronal counts. Similarly, exposure to 10% ethanol did not induce any significant changes in chicks exposed for 2 or 8 gestational days. Thus, these results suggest that gestational ethanol exposure induces a reduction in the mean number per section of PV and CR expressing hippocampal neurons, and could be a possible mechanism responsible for learning and memory disorders in FAS.",M2

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a two-tiered method for ascertainment of FAS/partial FAS cases, comprising: screening of growth parameters, diagnostic assessment for screen-positive children using clinical and neurocognitive assessments, and maternal history of drinking during pregnancy. Mothers or caregivers of FAS children and matched controls were interviewed. SETTING: Primary schools in De Aar (8) and Upington (15). Subjects. Grade 1 pupils in 2001 (De Aar, N=536) and 2002 (Upington, N=1299). OUTCOME MEASURES: FAS or partial FAS.

Growth retardation was also common in this population: 66.6% (1181/1774) were underweight, 48.3% (858/1776) stunted, and 15.1% had a head circumference &lt;2 SD for age. Mothers of children with FAS were less likely to have full-time employment or have attended secondary school and had lower body mass index, and about 80% currently smoked. Over two-thirds of all pregnancies had been unplanned. CONCLUSIONS: A very high proportion of pupils (nearly 1 in 10) had FAS/partial FAS, the rate in De Aar being the highest yet described in South Africa. FAS/partial FAS may contribute to the extremely high rate of growth retardation in South Africa as a whole and is a major cause of learning disability. These epidemiological features are important in designing preventive interventions.",M2
19175817,"Executive function deficits in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB).BACKGROUND: Chronic prenatal alcohol exposure causes a spectrum of deleterious effects in offspring, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and deficits in executive function are prevalent in FASD. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that children with FASD exhibit performance deficits in tasks that assess attention, planning and spatial working memory. METHODS: Subjects (8-15 years male and female children) with a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), partial FAS (pFAS), or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and age- and sex-matched controls, completed four tasks selected from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB). RESULTS: Compared with age-matched control children (n = 92), subjects with FASD (n = 89) exhibited longer reaction and decision times (effect size range; Cohen's d = .51 to .73), suggesting deficits in attention. Children with FASD demonstrated deficits in planning and spatial working memory that became more pronounced when task difficulty increased. The largest effect size in this study population (Cohen's d = 1.1) occurred in the spatial working memory task. Only one outcome measure revealed differences across the diagnostic subgroups, although all groups were different from control. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that deficits in multiple executive function domains, including set shifting, planning and strategy use, attention and spatial working memory, can be assessed in children with FASD using an easy to administer, brief battery of computer-based neuropsychological tasks. The tasks appear to be equally sensitive for brain injury resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol, regardless of the presence of facial dysmorphology.",M2
19129565,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.BACKGROUND: Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy leads to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in their children. FASD is characterized by typical facial features, growth retardation, intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. JUSTIFICATION: Alcohol is neurotoxic to the brain during the developmental stage. Behavioral problems in children with FASD start at an early age and progress to adulthood. It is an important preventable cause of intellectual dysfunction and behavioral problems. This article reviews current prevalence, clinical features, pathogenesis and differential diagnosis of FASD. It also highlights the need for physicians to be aware of this condition. SEARCH STRATEGY: Articles were searched on the internet using fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, women and alcohol. Following links were used to locate journals; EBSCO, OVID, Science Direct, PubMed and NIAAA. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a spectrum of deficits. Though physical features are essential to make the diagnosis of <e>FAS</e>, it is important to note that neurocognitive and behavioural deficits can be present in the absence of physical features (alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder or ARND). Because there is no known safe amount of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, abstinence from alcohol for women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy must be strongly advised.",M2
19110231,"Alterations in phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element of binding protein activity: a pathway for fetal alcohol syndrome-related neurotoxicity.OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is the leading cause of a spectrum of preventable nongenetic learning and behavioral disorders. In adult (FAS) mice, we measured phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element of binding protein (pCREB) staining in hippocampal subregions to evaluate a possible mechanism underlying FAS learning deficits. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol or control (saline). After learning assessment, the offspring were perfused for immunohistochemistry and brain sections probed using SER 133 pCREB antibody. Relative staining density was assessed using National Institutes of Health Image software. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance with P &lt; .05 considered significant. RESULTS: In all hippocampal subregions, pCREB staining was greater in the control animals than in the alcohol-treated group (P &lt; or = .0001). CONCLUSION: In utero alcohol exposure decreased pCREB activity in hippocampal subregions of adult mice. The dentate gyrus had the most robust cumulative decrease in pCREB staining, suggesting FAS adult learning deficits may correlate to enhanced dentate gyrus neurodegeneration.",M2
18957339,"[Alcohol and pregnancy: diagnostic aspects and abnormalities in the placental vitamin A pathway]Maternal alcohol drinking during pregnancy is a reality in France leading to new-born specific clinical signs called  Fetal alcoholic syndrome/<e>FAS</e>  in 1.5 per 1000 births and to common clinical signs grouped into  Fetal Linked to Alcohol Spectrum Disorders  in 5 per 1000 births. Our works presented for the attribution of the SFBC 2007 price talked about two aspects of this public health problem. The first presented the recent evaluation of the alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Auvergne by the realization of the DATAMATER clinical and biological study on more than 800  mother/baby  couples. We confirmed the reality of such maternal drinking (1.8 FAS per 1000 births) and also the useless of biological tools to help the diagnosis of the clinician where the clinical signs did not clearly belonged to FAS and when the maternal consumption was asked. The second aspect reviewed the placental abnormalities occurring during the FAS, which could explain the intra-uterine growth retardation. To better understand the genesis of such alterations, we proposed a new physio-pathological mechanism. The alcohol could alter the retinol (vitamin A) activation into retinoic acid, a fundamental morphogenic molecule for the optimal development and functions of the placenta.",M2
18852517,"Age- and area-dependent distinct effects of ethanol on Bax and Bcl-2 expression in prenatal rat brain.Cell proliferation and differentiation are critical processes in a developing fetal rat brain, during which programmed cell death (PCD) also plays an important role. One of the decisive factors for PCD is Bcl-2 family proteins, where Bax induces cell death, whereas Bcl-2 acts as an inhibitor of PCD. As maternal drinking is known to cause fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) or malformation of the fetal brain during pregnancy, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether maternal ethanol exposure alters the PCD-related Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression during fetal brain development. Pregnant female rats were orally treated with 10% ethanol and the subsequent expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2 proteins examined in the fetal brain, including the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, from gestational day (GD) 15.5 to GD 19.5, using Western blots, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. With regard to the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax proteins (Bcl-2/Bax), the Bax protein was dominant in the forebrain and midbrain of the control GD 15.5 fetuses, except for the hindbrain, when compared with the respective ethanol-treated groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 became dominant in the midbrain of the control GD 17.5 fetuses when compared with the ethanoltreated group, representing an alternation of the natural PCD process by ethanol. Furthermore, a differential expression of the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins was found in the differentiating and migrating zones of the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Thus, when taken together, the present results suggest that ethanol affects PCD in the cell differentiation and migration zones of the prenatal rat brain by modulating Bax and Bcl-2 expression in an age- and area-dependent manner. Therefore, this is the first evidence that ethanol may alter FAS-associated embryonic brain development through the alteration of Bax and Bcl-2 expression.",M2
18828799,"Neuropsychological study of FASD in a sample of American Indian children: processing simple versus complex information.BACKGROUND: Although a large body of literature exists on cognitive functioning in alcohol-exposed children, it is unclear if there is a signature neuropsychological profile in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This study assesses cognitive functioning in children with FASD from several American Indian reservations in the Northern Plains States, and it applies a hierarchical model of simple versus complex information processing to further examine cognitive function. We hypothesized that complex tests would discriminate between children with FASD and culturally similar controls, while children with FASD would perform similar to controls on relatively simple tests. METHODS: Our sample includes 32 control children and 24 children with a form of FASD [fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) = 10, partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) = 14]. The test battery measures general cognitive ability, verbal fluency, executive functioning, memory, and fine-motor skills. RESULTS: Many of the neuropsychological tests produced results consistent with a hierarchical model of simple versus complex processing. The complexity of the tests was determined  a priori  based on the number of cognitive processes involved in them. Multidimensional scaling was used to statistically analyze the accuracy of classifying the neurocognitive tests into a simple versus complex dichotomy. Hierarchical logistic regression models were then used to define the contribution made by complex versus simple tests in predicting the significant differences between children with FASD and controls. Complex test items discriminated better than simple test items. The tests that conformed well to the model were the Verbal Fluency, Progressive Planning Test (PPT), the Lhermitte memory tasks, and the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The FASD-grouped children, when compared with controls, demonstrated impaired performance on letter fluency, while their performance was similar on category fluency. On the more complex PPT trials (problems 5 to 8), as well as the Lhermitte logical tasks, the FASD group performed the worst. CONCLUSIONS: The differential performance between children with FASD and controls was evident across various neuropsychological measures. The children with FASD performed significantly more poorly on the complex tasks than did the controls. The identification of a neurobehavioral profile in children with prenatal alcohol exposure will help clinicians identify and diagnose children with FASD.",M2
18780169,"Racial disparities in pregnancy-related drinking reduction.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the likelihood that women of different racial and ethnic groups would reduce their alcohol consumption during pregnancy. METHODS: Data came from 22 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from 2001 to 2005. After stratifying the sample by preconception drinking level, logistic regressions were used to predict drinking reduction and cessation by the third trimester by race, controlling for age, education, marital status, Medicaid status, pregnancy intention, smoking status, and state. RESULTS: Overall, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic women were all significantly less likely than White women to reduce their heavy drinking after becoming pregnant. American Indian/Alaskan Native women who were moderate drinkers before conception were over 2 times more likely than White women to reduce drinking after becoming pregnant (OR 2.19, CI 0.71, 6.76), although this difference was non-significant (P = .17). Among those who binge drank in the months before pregnancy, compared to White women, Black (OR 0.26, CI 0.17-0.39), Hispanic (OR 0.19, CI 0.12-0.29), American Indian/Alaskan Native (OR 0.44 CI 0.20, 0.96), and Asian/Pacific Islander women (OR 0.11, CI 0.06-0.22) were all less likely to quit binge drinking while pregnant. CONCLUSION: Significant racial differences in pregnancy-related drinking reduction are evident, and may help explain racial disparities in <e>FAS</e>. Results suggest that more targeted efforts are needed to meet the national goals of preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies.",M2
18778455,"Ethanol neurotoxicity and dentate gyrus development.Maternal alcohol ingestion during pregnancy adversely affects the developing fetus, often leading to fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). One of the most severe consequences of FAS is brain damage that is manifested as cognitive, learning, and behavioral deficits. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in such abilities; it is also known as one of the brain regions most vulnerable to ethanol-induced neurotoxicity. Our recent studies using morphometric techniques have further shown that ethanol neurotoxicity appears to affect the development of the dentate gyrus in a region-specific manner; it was found that early postnatal ethanol exposure causes a transitory deficit in the hilus volume of the dentate gyrus. It is strongly speculated that such structural modifications, even transitory ones, appear to result in developmental abnormalities in the brain circuitry and lead to the learning disabilities observed in FAS children. Based on reports on possible factors deciding ethanol neurotoxicity to the brain, we review developmental neurotoxicity to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation.",M2
18713153,"Automated diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome using 3D facial image analysis.OBJECTIVES: Use three-dimensional (3D) facial laser scanned images from children with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and controls to develop an automated diagnosis technique that can reliably and accurately identify individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. METHODS: A detailed dysmorphology evaluation, history of prenatal alcohol exposure, and 3D facial laser scans were obtained from 149 individuals (86 FAS; 63 Control) recruited from two study sites (Cape Town, South Africa and Helsinki, Finland). Computer graphics, machine learning, and pattern recognition techniques were used to automatically identify a set of facial features that best discriminated individuals with FAS from controls in each sample. RESULTS: An automated feature detection and analysis technique was developed and applied to the two study populations. A unique set of facial regions and features were identified for each population that accurately discriminated FAS and control faces without any human intervention. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that computer algorithms can be used to automatically detect facial features that can discriminate FAS and control faces.",M2
18656528,"Effects of ethanol on the development of genetically determined epilepsies in rats.In the present study, we provide evidences for a differential effect of perinatal alcohol exposure with a direct correlation to the genetic background on the development of seizures. Ethanol (EtOH) is a widely used psychoactive substance that exerts its action by affecting multiple targets in the central nervous system. EtOH is known to interact with almost all identified neurotransmitters although its effects on excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmissions are considered to be particularly important in the mediation of its behavioural effects. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a wide variety of offspring's abnormalities which lead to the so called foetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), which is also related to a higher susceptibility to convulsions. In our study, a rat strain of convulsive epilepsy, the GEPRs rats, displayed an increase of seizure susceptibility after foetal exposure to this teratogenic drug, while a non-convulsive rat strain of absence epilepsy, the WAG/Rij rat, did not fully develop its characteristic features. However, when all groups of rat where tested for pentyletetrazole-induced convulsion, animals perinatally treated with ethanol were less responsive in comparison to their respective controls. These results are in agreement with previous reports showing how the genetic background can directly influence the teratogenic effects of alcohol, and this can be strictly related to the variability in the observation of offspring anomalies in humans which has lead to a 5-category classification system for individuals exposed to alcohol in uterus.",M2
18571671,"Eye malformations in children with heavy alcohol exposure in utero.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether children who do not develop fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) despite heavy alcohol exposure are at risk for eye abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We screened 9628 pregnant women and identified 101 women who were drinking &gt;/= 2 oz of absolute alcohol per day and 101 nondrinking control women. We followed 43 exposed and 55 control offspring between age 4 and 9 years, performing masked standardized ophthalomologic examinations. RESULTS: The groups did not differ in their rates of impaired visual acuity, refractory errors, ptosis, epicanthal folds, or short palpebral fissures. Biomicroscopy examination was normal in all exposed subjects; cataracts were detected in 2 control subjects (4%) but in no exposed subjects. Arterial tortuosity was seen in 7 exposed subjects (16%) and in 8 control subjects (15%). Optic nerve hypoplasia was not detected in any subject. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has found that children with FAS have a high incidence of serious ophthalmologic defects; our data indicate that the risk is limited to children with FAS and does not extend to children exposed to high levels of alcohol prenatally who do not develop FAS. Eye examinations are unlikely to clarify the diagnosis in children suspected of having alcohol-related damage.",M2
18557830,"Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure demonstrate deficits on multiple measures of concept formation.BACKGROUND: Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have documented impairments in executive functioning (EF). One component of EF, concept formation, has not been well studied in this group. METHODS: Children (8 to 18 years) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, with and without fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), were compared to typically developing controls on 2 measures of concept formation and conceptual set shifting: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Card Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System. In addition to between-group comparisons, performance relative to overall intellectual functioning was examined. RESULTS: Children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure showed impairment on both tests of concept formation compared to non-exposed controls. These deficits included difficulty generating and verbalizing concepts, increased error rates and perseverative responses, and poorer response to feedback. However, in comparison to controls, alcohol-exposed children performed better on measures of concept formation than predicted by their overall IQ scores. Exploratory analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in how the measures relate at different IQ levels and may not be specific to prenatal alcohol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in concept formation and conceptual set shifting were observed in alcohol-exposed children with or without the diagnosis of FAS and in the absence of mental retardation. These deficits likely impact problem solving skills and adaptive functioning and have implications for therapeutic interventions in this population.",M2
18544794,"Building clinical capacity for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder diagnoses in western and northern Canada.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder are common problems. In response to this problem the Canada Northwest FASD Research Network was established in 2005 by the Canada Northwest FASD Ministerial Partnership. This study was conducted to determine the FASD clinical activity in Canada Northwest. METHODS: The Network identified all clinical programs via Internet sites, provincial postings and professional word of mouth references that purported to do FASD assessments regularly using a multidisciplinary assessment team. Each of these programs was sent a questionnaire asking about clinical capacity, aggregate diagnostic results, team composition, time of clinical assessment and cost of assessment. RESULTS: Of the 27 programs identified to receive the questionnaire 15 programs responded. These programs were determined to have evaluated about 85% of the patients evaluated by all the programs. The total 7 jurisdictional capacity for FASD diagnosis was 816 evaluations in 2005 and projected to be 975 in 2006. Selection methods for appointing patients for assessment seemed excellent as 23% of those assessed were found to have <e>FAS</e> or pFAS and another 44% had other forms of FASD. The most common professionals to participate in the team evaluations were Paediatricians, Clinical Psychologists, Speech and Language Pathologists and Occupational Therapists. INTERPRETATION: Clinics are developing in western and northern Canada to diagnose patients with FASD. Comparing the experiences of these clinics can help to determine the continued need to increase diagnostic capacity, standardize diagnostic approaches to assure consistency of approach and diagnosis across the sites and appropriately staff and fund the programs. Key words: FASD; diagnosis; Canada; clinics.",M2
18532953,"Pregnancy characteristics of women giving birth to children with fetal alcohol syndrome in Far North Queensland.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) has been identified as a major cause of impairment to normal physical and intellectual development among Indigenous children in Far North Queensland; however, little is known of the pregnancy characteristics of mothers of those children diagnosed with FAS or of interventions that might assist in lowering the prevalence of the syndrome. AIM: To review the pregnancy records of women whose infants were subsequently diagnosed with FAS by the Paediatric Outreach Service (POS) of the Cairns Base Hospital, and to determine how such women might be identified prospectively in pregnancy and offered intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study involving all children diagnosed with FAS by the POS between 1994 and 2006; maternal pregnancy records were accessed and details obtained. RESULTS: Mothers of cases were older, of higher parity, smoked more cigarettes, attended fewer antenatal visits and experienced more antenatal and delivery complications than mothers of controls. The average gestational age at booking was not statistically significant between the two groups. There was a significant difference between the two groups in self-reported alcohol consumption both before and during pregnancy and in numbers of women who decreased alcohol consumption once the diagnosis of pregnancy was known to them. CONCLUSIONS: There is the potential to identify prospectively women presenting for antenatal care who are heavy drinkers and risk FAS in their infants, using the self-reported information about alcohol intake already being collected by our service; such women may then be offered specific interventions to try to reduce alcohol consumption in pregnancy.",M2
18512209,"Postnatal binge-like alcohol exposure reduces spine density without affecting dendritic morphology in rat mPFC.Among the deficits associated with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), cognitive impairments are the most debilitating and permanent. These impairments, including deficits in goal-directed behavior, attention, temporal planning, and other executive functions, could result from damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area that has not been studied sufficiently in the context of FAS. Neuronal connectivity in this area, as measured by distribution of dendritic spines and the complexity of dendritic tree structure, can be influenced by exogenous variables other than alcohol, and the neuronal connectivity in other brain regions can be affected by alcohol exposure. The goal of this study was to determine whether binge-like alcohol exposure on postnatal days (PD) 4-9 affects dendritic spine density and other dendritic tree parameters in mPFC that could possibly underlie functional damage. Rats were intubated with alcohol [5.25 g/kg/day; alcohol exposed (AE)], sham intubated (SI), or remained with the mother (SC, suckle control) on PD 4-9. Animals were sacrificed between PD 26 and PD 30 and brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining. Apical dendrite complexity and spine density were evaluated for layer III neurons in the mPFC using NeuroLucida software (MicroBrightField, Inc.). Spine density was significantly decreased in AE animals relative to SI and SC controls, but no differences in dendritic complexity were found across experimental groups. Our findings demonstrate that neonatal alcohol exposure has a persistent effect on the spine density in mPFC that can explain functional deficits in this cortical area.",M2
18498046,"Alcohol use, injuries, and prenatal visits during three successive pregnancies among American Indian women on the Northern Plains who have children with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to compare three sequential pregnancies of American Indian women who have children with <e>FAS</e> or children with incomplete FAS with women who did not have children with FAS. METHODS: Two retrospective case-control studies were conducted of Northern Plains American Indian children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) (Study 1) or incomplete FAS (Study 2) in 1981-1993. Three successive pregnancies ending in live births of 43 case mothers who had children with FAS, and 35 case mothers who had children with incomplete FAS were compared to the pregnancies of 86 and 70 control mothers who did not have children with FAS, respectively, in the two studies. Prenatal records were abstracted for the index child (child with FAS or incomplete FAS) and siblings born just before and just after the index child, and comparable prenatal records for the controls. RESULTS: Compared to the controls, significantly more case mothers used alcohol before and after all three pregnancies and during pregnancy with the before sibling and the index child. Mothers who had children with FAS reduced their alcohol use during the pregnancy following the birth of the index child. All Study 1 case mothers (100%) and 60% of Study 2 case mothers used alcohol during the pregnancy with the index child compared to 20 and 9% of respective control mothers. More study 1 case mothers experienced unintentional injuries (OR 9.50) and intentional injuries during the index pregnancy (OR 9.33) than the control mothers. Most case mothers began prenatal care in the second trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol use was documented before, during and after each of the three pregnancies. Women of child-bearing age should be screened for alcohol use whenever they present for medical services. Mothers who had a child with FAS decreased their alcohol consumption with the next pregnancy, a finding that supports the importance of prenatal screening throughout pregnancy. Women who receive medical care for injuries should be screened for alcohol use and referred for appropriate treatment. Protective custody, case management and treatment services need to be readily available for women who use alcohol.",M2

18373726,"Is pregnancy the time to change alcohol consumption habits in France?BACKGROUND: Although it is well known that France has a cultural history of alcohol use, no recent French data on alcohol consumption during pregnancy in a large sample are available. METHODS: To determine the alcohol consumption patterns among pregnant women in France, we analyzed data from a 1-year multicenter self-survey. Sociodemographic profile, obstetrical history, neonatal data, and a self-report for assessing drinking patterns during pregnancy including AUDIT were recorded from women who delivered recently. Cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 837 pregnant women have described all parameters. The mean age at delivery of our sample was 29.7 years (SD = 4.8 years). A total of 52.2% of women indicated that they had consumed alcohol at least once during their pregnancy, and among abstainers 54.5% had a positive AUDIT score. Of the pregnant women who consumed alcohol, 13.7% reported at least one binge drinking episode (5 or more drinks on 1 occasion) during pregnancy. Binge drinking is significantly more frequent than regular alcohol consumption (at least 1 drink more than 1 time per week) during pregnancy. A prevalence rate of FAS of 1.8 per 1,000 live births was observed. CONCLUSIONS: There is a large population of women who still drink alcohol during pregnancy, particularly in binge drinking episodes. This underlines the need to clearly inform women of childbearing age about the dangers of alcohol during pregnancy as related to all types of consumption. Moreover, acting to prevent alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy may also greatly influence prenatal drinking.",M2
18336634,"Maternal risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome and partial fetal alcohol syndrome in South Africa: a third study.OBJECTIVES: This is a third exploration of risk factors for the two most severe forms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and Partial FAS (PFAS), in a South African community with the highest reported prevalence of FAS in the world. METHODS: In a case control design, interview and collateral data concerning mothers of 72 first grade children with FAS or PFAS are compared with 134 randomly selected maternal controls of children from the same schools. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the mothers of FASD children and controls in socio-economic status, educational attainment, and a higher prevalence of FASD among rural residents. The birth order of the index children, gravidity, and still birth were significantly higher among mothers of FASD children. Mothers of children with a FASD are less likely to be married and more likely to have a male partner who drank during the index pregnancy. Current and gestational alcohol use by mothers of FASD children is bingeing on weekends, with no reduction in drinking reported in any trimester in 75 to 90% of the pregnancies that resulted in an FAS child or during 50 to 87% of PFAS-producing pregnancies. There was significantly less drinking among the controls in the second and third trimesters (11 to 14%). Estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)s of the mothers of PFAS children range from 0.155 in the first trimester to 0.102 in the third, and for mothers of FAS children the range is from 0.197 to 0.200 to 0.191 in the first, second, and third. Smoking percentage during pregnancy was significantly higher for mothers of FASD children (82 to 84%) than controls (35%); but average quantity smoked is low in the 3 groups at 30 to 41 cigarettes per week. A relatively young average age of the mother at the time of FAS and PFAS births (28.8 and 24.8 years respectively) is not explained by early onset of regular drinking (mean = 20.3 to 20.5 years of age). But the mean years of alcohol consumption is different between groups, 16.3, 10.7, and 12.1 years respectively for mothers of FAS, FASD, and drinking controls. Mothers of FAS and PFAS children were significantly smaller in height and weight than controls at time of interview. The child's total dysmorphology score correlates significantly with mother's weight (-0.46) and BMI (-0.39). Bivariate correlations are significant between the child's dysmorphology and known independent demographic and behavioral maternal risk factors for FASD: higher gravidity and parity; lower education and income; rural residence; drinks consumed daily, weekly, and bingeing during pregnancy; drinking in all trimesters; partner's alcohol consumption during pregnancy; and use of tobacco during pregnancy. Similar significant correlations were also found for most of the above independent maternal risk variables and the child's verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ and behavioral problems. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal data in this population are generally consistent with a spectrum of effects exhibited in the children. Variation within the spectrum links greater alcohol doses with a greater severity of effects among children of older and smaller mothers of lower socio economic status in their later pregnancies. Prevention is needed to address known maternal risk factors for FASD in this population.",M2
18299640,"Fetal alcohol syndrome disorder pilot media intervention in New Jersey.BACKGROUND: The New Jersey Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Task Force launched the âBe in the kNOwâ multimedia public education campaign in July 2006. The campaign continued until December 2006. OBJECTIVE: To report on the pilot media intervention campaign in Essex and Atlantic Counties, New Jersey, with the goal of identifying strategies to help prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD). METHODS: The campaign used various media outlets from July 2006 to December 2006, including billboard posters along New Jersey transit routes serving Atlantic City and Newark, local newspapers and radio public service announcements. Messages were distributed in English and Spanish and were primarily aimed at Essex and Atlantic counties. Printed material was distributed throughout the community. All media materials included an 800 number for the New Jersey Family Health Line. Data was collected from individual callers. RESULTS: A total of 49 Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) related telephone calls were received through the Family Health Line over the six-month period. An increase from the 5-6 FAS calls typically received in a six-month period. Callers were located throughout New Jersey with 24.5% from Essex County, 12.2% from Mercer County, and 12.2% from Bergen County. 69% of callers identified themselves as white, 25% black, and 6% other. 76% of callers were female. Ages ranged from 8 to 50. CONCLUSION: The media intervention reached a wide geographic audience, provoking interest beyond the initial target area and expected age ranges. The results, however, point to the difficulty of raising awareness of FASD.",M2
18299639,"What human service professionals know and want to know about fetal alcohol syndrome.BACKGROUND: Although human service professionals are critical to prevention of primary and secondary disabilities among those who are or could be affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol surprisingly little information is available on their knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs about this problem. This article presents the results from a statewide survey (2005) undertaken in the United States to gain such information. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to : a) measure the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) of professionals working in the fields of child welfare/child protective services, foster care, and Medicaid enrollment, and b) use that knowledge to inform educational and training resources to help them with their work. METHODS: A purposive sample of human service professionals in 42 counties completed a self-administered survey patterned after similar FAS surveys for other professionals. RESULTS: The results were based on answers from 1,168 human service professional respondents that showed that they were knowledgeable about primary prevention. However, it also revealed that they had lesser knowledge of epidemiology, how to recognize children with FAS, and methods to work with them. The fact that 90% of the respondents reported they did not care for children with FAS - is an important finding. Conclusions: Although these findings suggest that human service professionals are knowledgeable about primary prevention, they lack additional education and assertive assessment protocols. These resources are needed to help them work with families and children who are already affected by exposure to alcohol in utero.",M2
18249266,"Acute ethanol administration causes malformations but does not affect cranial morphometry in neonatal mice.Ethanol is a known teratogen and has been implicated in the etiology of human fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), which is characterized by distinct craniofacial abnormalities such as microcephaly, agnathia, and ocular aberrations. Attempts at quantifying the craniofacial anomalies arising from ethanol exposure have largely been limited to radiographic evaluation in postnatal rats. Such studies discount the role of the cranial soft tissue in the morphology of FAS. We present a study whose aim was to conduct measurements of the entire head including soft and hard tissue in full-term fetuses of mice by means of a digital analyzer, while at the same time comparing stained skeletal tissues in treated and untreated animals. Thirteen pregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed with 25% ethanol (vol/vol) on gestation days (E) 6, 7, and 8, whereas 10 pregnant mice received water only. Fetuses were retrieved from the animals just before delivery on E18, digitally photographed, measured, and assessed for abnormalities. Ethanol-exposed mice showed a number of abnormalities such as anophthalmia and agnathia, but these were not significantly increased over those from nontreated fetuses (P=.5). Birth weight (P=.5), crown-rump length (P=.8), and mandibular length (P=.9) were also not significantly reduced compared to control fetuses. However, defects in some cranial bones and degrees of ossification that trailed same-stage controls were observed in treated animals, at a nonstatistically significant level (P=.14). Acute maternal ingestion of alcohol in mice during pregnancy may not cause a significant increase in craniofacial or skeletal defects when evaluated at term. However, these effects may be latent, manifesting postnatally. The postnatal ability of mice for recovery from alcohol-induced birth defects deserves further investigation.",M2
18240165,"Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) in C57BL/6 mice detected through proteomics screening of the amniotic fluid.BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), a severe consequence of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, is associated with craniofacial defects, mental retardation, and stunted growth. Previous studies in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice provide evidence that alcohol-induced pathogenesis follows early changes in gene expression within specific molecular pathways in the embryonic headfold. Whereas the former (B6J) pregnancies carry a high-risk for dysmorphogenesis following maternal exposure to 2.9 g/kg alcohol (two injections spaced 4.0 h apart on gestation day 8), the latter (B6N) pregnancies carry a low-risk for malformations. The present study used this murine model to screen amniotic fluid for biomarkers that could potentially discriminate between FAS-positive and FAS-negative pregnancies. METHODS: B6J and B6N litters were treated with alcohol (exposed) or saline (control) on day 8 of gestation. Amniotic fluid aspirated on day 17 (n = 6 replicate litters per group) was subjected to trypsin digestion for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry with the aid of denoising algorithms, statistical testing, and classification methods. RESULTS: We identified several peaks in the proteomics screen that were reduced consistently and specifically in exposed B6J litters. Preliminary characterization by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional protein identification mapped the reduced peaks to alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The predictive strength of AFP deficiency as a biomarker for FAS-positive litters was confirmed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS:: These findings in genetically susceptible mice support clinical observations in maternal serum that implicate a decrease in AFP levels following prenatal alcohol damage.",M2
18221215,"Novel molecular targets for the prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome.Alcohol abuse produces damaging effects on the CNS that leads to several types of disorders. When consumed during pregnancy, alcohol may cause craniofacial malformations, growth retardation and brain damage in offspring. These symptoms are grouped by the term fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). FAS is the most common cause of non-genetic mental retardation in the western world. Substantial efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of these impairments are currently in progress. Whereas FAS is totally preventable by avoiding alcohol intake during pregnancy, efficient therapies to prevent or mitigate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure are still not available but many pharmacological treatments have been developed to avoid alcohol intake and dependence in adults. The present article reviews the most relevant mechanisms of alcohol injury in developing brain and the strategies and patents that are currently available and in progress to prevent therapy for FAS.",M2
18196450,"Characteristics of grandmothers who have grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome or incomplete fetal alcohol syndrome.INTRODUCTION: Characteristics of Northern Plains American Indian maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) or incomplete FAS are described to more effectively prevent fetal FAS and alcohol use during pregnancy. METHODS: Study 1 had 27 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS and Study 2 had 18 grandmothers with grandchildren who had incomplete FAS (cases) which were compared with 119 maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren without FAS (controls). The grandchildren were born between 1981 and 1993 on the Northern Plains. Medical records were manually reviewed for each case and control grandmother. Data were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi square. RESULTS: Study 1 case grandmothers were more likely to experience medical problems (70.4%) including trauma (48.1%) and injuries (51.9%) than the controls. Most of the Study 1 and 2 case grandmothers (92.6% and 77.8%, respectively) had alcohol use documented in their medical records compared to less than half of the control grandmothers. Seven (15.6%) of the case grandmothers had more than one grandchild in either Study 1 or Study 2. CONCLUSION: Maternal grandmothers who had grandchildren with FAS had significantly higher rates of alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems than control grandmothers. Antenatal care providers should screen pregnant women for alcohol use at their first visit. The provider needs to ask the women who are using alcohol about their mothers' use of alcohol to provide appropriate care and counseling for the women and prevent FAS.",M2
18166669,"Fetal alcohol syndrome prevention using community-based narrowcasting campaigns.Preventing fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) by encouraging pregnant women to abstain from drinking alcohol competes with commercial alcohol marketing. Two FAS-prevention campaigns using a narrowcast approach among young women of childbearing age in two disadvantaged Southern California communities are compared. The design, implementation process, and degree to which campaigns reached the priority populations are the focus of this article. Formative research shows that young women in disadvantaged communities receive mixed messages about dangers of drinking during pregnancy. A social norms approach using positive role models was the most acceptable message strategy based on materials pretesting. Differences in campaign implementation and distribution strategies between communities were documented through program monitoring. Survey research indicated the more viable messaging and implementation strategies. Findings show that low-cost community campaigns are feasible; however, variations in messaging, distribution strategies, and saturation levels determine whether such campaigns succeed or fail to reach priority populations.",M2
18162064,"Impaired eyeblink conditioning in children with fetal alcohol syndrome.BACKGROUND: Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is a Pavlovian paradigm that involves contingent temporal pairing of a conditioned stimulus (e.g., tone) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., air puff). Animal studies have shown that binge consumption of alcohol during pregnancy impairs EBC and that this impairment is likely mediated by a loss of neurons in the inferior olive and the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei, as well as by a reduction in neural plasticity in the cerebellar deep nuclei. METHODS: Short delay EBC was examined in 98 5-year-old children born to women from the Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, who were recruited prenatally and are participating in the first prospective longitudinal study of children with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). FAS status was assessed at 5 years by expert dysmorphologists. Two sessions of 50 trials each were administered to the children; a third session was administered the following day to those children who did not meet criterion of 40% conditioned responses in session 2. RESULTS: Not a single child with FAS met criterion for conditioning as contrasted with 75.0% of the controls. Whereas 86.7% of the controls who were conditioned met criterion by the end of Session 2, a large proportion of the relatively few alcohol-exposed nonsyndromal children who conditioned did not do so until Session 3. These alcohol effects on EBC persisted after controlling for IQ. Three of 4 microcephalic children who were not exposed to alcohol were successfully conditioned. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to demonstrate impaired EBC in children diagnosed with FAS. Successful EBC in a microcephalic group supports the inference that the EBC deficit is specific to prenatal alcohol exposure and a potential biomarker for diagnosis of exposed children lacking the distinctive FAS dysmorphology. Delay EBC has a high sensitivity for identifying individuals with a diagnosis of probable FAS.",M2
18054075,"Impaired placentation in fetal alcohol syndrome.Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the key features of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), and IUGR can be mediated by impaired placentation. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) regulate placentation due to stimulatory effects on extravillous trophoblasts, which are highly motile and invasive. Previous studies demonstrated that extravillous trophoblasts express high levels of aspartyl-(asparaginyl) beta-hydroxylase (AAH), a gene that is regulated by IGF and has a critical role in cell motility and invasion. The present study examines the hypothesis that ethanol impaired placentation is associated with inhibition of AAH expression in trophoblasts. Pregnant Long Evans rats were fed isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 37% ethanol by caloric content. Placentas harvested on gestation day 16 were used for histopathological, mRNA, and protein studies to examine AAH expression in relation to the integrity of placentation and ethanol exposure. Chronic ethanol feeding prevented or impaired the physiological conversion of uterine vessels required for expansion of maternal circulation into placenta, a crucial process for adequate placentation. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated significant reductions in IRS-1, IRS-2, and significant increases in IGF-II and IGF-II receptor mRNA levels in ethanol-exposed placentas. These abnormalities were associated with significantly reduced levels of AAH expression in trophoblastic cells, particularly within the mesometrial triangle (deep placental bed) as demonstrated by real time quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, ELISA, and immunohistochemical staining. Ethanol-impaired placentation is associated with inhibition of AAH expression in trophoblasts. This effect of chronic gestational exposure to ethanol may contribute to IUGR in FAS.",M2
18043782,"Impacts of alcohol use in pregnancy--the role of the GP.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is a preventable cause of developmental delay and growth failure. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and the role of the general practitioner in prevention and management. DISCUSSION: Early diagnosis of and intervention for problems associated with FAS reduce adverse long term outcomes. Most health professionals have limited knowledge of FASD and lack confidence in the diagnosis and management of children with FASD. General practitioners have an important role in identifying women and children at risk of harm from alcohol and arranging referral for assessment and management when necessary. Educational materials for health professionals are currently under development.",M2
18026824,"Enhanced case management to prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in Northern Plains communities.Women proven to be extremely high risk for drinking during pregnancy were provided case management (CM) enhanced with strategies derived from motivational interviewing (MI) as a part of a comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) epidemiology and prevention program in four American Indian communities in Northern Plains states. Data on the first women enrolled (n=131) revealed that they have extreme issues with alcohol abuse to overcome. Sixty-five percent of these women have experienced extensive alcohol use within their immediate family. At intake, 24% of CM clients reported binge drinking one or more days in the preceding week. Heavy drinking resulted in estimated blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) as high as .576 using the BACCUS methodology. Project staff has attempted to actively engage each of these women in CM. Clients have been in CM an average of 17.2 months (SD=16.6). The mean number of significant contacts (face-to-face or telephone MI sessions) was 19. Thirty-one percent of the women entered some type of formal alcohol or drug treatment while in CM. Data were collected at 6 month intervals from 6 to 72 months after enrollment. Consumption of alcohol, as measured by both quantity and frequency measures, was reduced at 6 months. Thirty-eight percent of enrolled women reported complete abstinence from alcohol use at 6 months, and the number of binges while drinking in CM declined significantly from 15 at baseline to 4.3 at 6 months. However, mean peak BACs for the heavy drinking sessions were still problematic for those who continued to drink. They ranged from .234 to .275 from baseline to 12 month follow-up, but the total number of binges was reduced substantially at 12 months as well. Furthermore, the most important outcomes are the status of the children born while in CM. One hundred and forty nine pregnancies have occurred among these women, and 76% of those pregnancies have resulted in normal deliveries, and only two children born in CM are suspected of having some form of severe FASD. At 6, 12, 18, and 24 month follow-up milestones, 70% of the women who were not currently pregnant were protected from having a child with FAS by not drinking, using birth control, or both. Other measures of CM success include enrolling in school, regaining custody of children, completing substance abuse treatment, probation from the criminal justice system, substantial periods of abstinence, enrolling in programs to improve life skills, and employment.",M2
17971190,"Complexity of foetal alcohol or drug neuroimpairments.AIMS: To describe children exposed to street drug during pregnancy (SDE) and compare these with children suffering from Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) regarding growth, somatic health and neuroimpairments. METHODS: In the region, Hordaland county an information program was carried out to educate health-care and social workers on symptoms and signs of SDE and FAS/FASD and referral was encouraged for suspected cases. Referred children received a neuropaediatric evaluation, and were categorized as FAS/FASD and SDE children. RESULTS: Among the referred children 50 were diagnosed with SDE and 47 children were diagnosed with FAS/FASD. SDE children had increased risk of neonatal abstinence symptoms but were somatic healthy and had no growth restriction and were performing well academically. Almost all children in both groups met the criteria of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). CONCLUSION: Children exposed to drugs are somatic healthy but have increased risk of neuroimpairments such as ADHD.",M2
17961254,"Computational selection and prioritization of candidate genes for fetal alcohol syndrome.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is a serious global health problem and is observed at high frequencies in certain South African communities. Although in utero alcohol exposure is the primary trigger, there is evidence for genetic- and other susceptibility factors in FAS development. No genome-wide association or linkage studies have been performed for FAS, making computational selection and -prioritization of candidate disease genes an attractive approach. RESULTS: 10174 Candidate genes were initially selected from the whole genome using a previously described method, which selects candidate genes according to their expression in disease-affected tissues. Hereafter candidates were prioritized for experimental investigation by investigating criteria pertinent to FAS and binary filtering. 29 Criteria were assessed by mining various database sources to populate criteria-specific gene lists. Candidate genes were then prioritized for experimental investigation using a binary system that assessed the criteria gene lists against the candidate list, and candidate genes were scored accordingly. A group of 87 genes was prioritized as candidates and for future experimental validation. The validity of the binary prioritization method was assessed by investigating the protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment and common promoter element binding sites of the top-ranked genes. CONCLUSION: This analysis highlighted a list of strong candidate genes from the TGF-beta, MAPK and Hedgehog signalling pathways, which are all integral to fetal development and potential targets for alcohol's teratogenic effect. We conclude that this novel bioinformatics approach effectively prioritizes credible candidate genes for further experimental analysis.",M2
19759993,"Knowledge and attitudes about fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and alcohol use during pregnancy by occupational therapists in the Midwest.Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) occurs in approximately 3 of 1,000 live births in the general population of the U.S. and is the leading known cause of mental retardation. The Midwest Regional Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Training Center (MRFASTC) surveyed 1,000 licensed occupational therapists (OT) of the American Occupational Therapists Association in a six-state Midwest region, including Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding FAS. Nearly 20% of the OTs responded. Of the respondents, nearly 94% regarded at least 1 drink per day as being 'heavy' in a pregnant woman. There was an increase in the number of respondents who thought it was acceptable to consume 1 drink or more with each advancing trimester of pregnancy. 92% of the OTs indicated a willingness to counsel a mother of a child having FAS, but 96% indicated a poor to fair ability to select valid and reliable assessment instruments for screening a child for FAS. Only 6% of the OT respondents indicated a good-excellent ability to conduct brief interventions on alcohol cessation for women. The data collectively indicate OTs possess similarities to other health care providers, including physicians and psychologists, in the misunderstanding or deficits of knowledge and skills associated with FAS and that they are largely unprepared to provide intervention for women 'at risk' for FAS, or to recognize correctly FAS in children. There is a demonstrated need, and desire, by the practicing OTs for continued education related to alcohol abuse associated with FAS.",M2
17850644,"Unique facial features distinguish fetal alcohol syndrome patients and controls in diverse ethnic populations.BACKGROUND: Effective management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is dependent on the timely and reliable diagnosis of affected individuals. There are significant diagnostic difficulties because of the reduced prominence of facial features as children age to adulthood as well as potential population or ethnic differences in the most characteristic alcohol-related facial features. METHODS: A total of 276 subjects were recruited from 4 sites (Cape Town, South Africa; Helsinki, Finland; Buffalo, New York; and San Diego, California) and completed a detailed dysmorphology evaluation to classify subjects as either fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>; 43%) or control (57%). Computerized anthropometry was employed to identify facial features that could distinguish FAS patients from controls across a wide age range and across ethnically disparate study populations. RESULTS: Subjects were placed into 1 of 4 populations based on their ancestry (Cape Coloured, Finnish Caucasian, African American, or North American Caucasian). Analyses performed in each of the 4 study populations were able to identify a unique set of variables which provided excellent discrimination between the 2 groups (FAS, control). In each study group, at least one ocular-related measurement, shortened palpebral fissure, reduced outer canthal width, or reduced inner canthal width, was included in the final classification model. CONCLUSIONS: We found measurements that reflected reduced size of the eye orbit to be a consistent feature discriminating FAS and controls across each study population. However, each population had a unique, though often overlapping, set of variables which discriminated the 2 groups, suggesting important ethnic differences in the presentation of FAS. It is possible that these differences were accentuated by the wide age distribution of the study subjects.",M2
17704098,"Fetal alcohol syndrome: a prospective national surveillance study.OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) seen by Australian paediatricians. METHODS: Active, national case-finding using the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU). Monthly reporting of incident cases aged &lt;15 years by paediatricians between January 2001 and December 2004. RESULTS: Over 1150 paediatricians submitted reports each month to the APSU. Of 169 reported cases, 92 fulfilled the study criteria for FAS. There was a significant increase in the number of children reported each year from 2001 to 2004. Of 92 children, 53.3% were male, 35.7% were preterm (&lt;37 weeks' gestation) and 64.6% were of low birth weight (&lt;2.5 kg). Most (94.4%) had high risk exposure to alcohol in utero and 78.3% were exposed to one or more additional drugs. The median age at diagnosis was 3.3 years (range: newborn to 11.9 years): 6.5% were diagnosed at birth and 63% by 5 years of age. Of the 92 cases, 56% had growth deficiency, 53.2% had microcephaly, 85.9% had evidence of central nervous system dysfunction, 24% had additional birth defects, 5.4% had sensorineural deafness and 4.3% had visual impairment. Of children with FAS, 65% were Indigenous, 51% had a sibling with FAS, and only 40.2% lived with a biological parent. CONCLUSION: Our data are the only prospective national data available on FAS throughout the world. These findings highlight the severity, complexity and impact of FAS, the need for effective strategies for prevention, and the necessity for education to facilitate earlier diagnosis, referral and reporting of cases.",M2
17701351,"Maternal alcohol consumption increases sphingosine levels in the brains of progeny mice.The effect of 'binge' alcohol upon sphingolipid metabolism in the fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) was examined in pregnant mice (C57BL/6J) by administering a single dose of alcohol during the third trimester (gestational day 15-16). The control mice were administered a sucrose solution of equal caloric value. Brains from progeny at postnatal days 5, 15, 21 and 30 were dissected into three regions, and sphingolipid concentrations of the brain regions were determined including assay of monoglycosylceramide, ceramide, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. We found that a single dose of ethanol induces an elevation of sphingosine (2-3.5-fold) in the brain of progeny. The level of brain ceramide at a dose of 1.5 g/kg was significantly higher than control. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy induces neuronal loss in progeny brains. Our result suggests that the elevation of sphingosine in progeny brain induced by maternal alcohol consumption may be responsible for observed neuronal loss in FAS.",M2
17700195,"Is meconium screening appropriate for universal use? Science and ethics say no.Researchers have been actively looking to biomarker development as a way to improve diagnosis in conditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) that have typically been difficult to identify at an early stage. Meconium testing is considered a potentially useful newborn screening method. Screening for alcohol (and other drug) use is unique from all other types of newborn screening in that there is a greater element of social risk for parents, particularly mothers (public exposure of substance use with potential for child welfare involvement). There are many factors related to the science and ethics of the meconium screening process to consider before implementing universal or targeted screening. As care providers who participate in the screening and counseling process and as advocates for infants and their families, neonatal nurses should be active participants in discussions surrounding the ethical and clinical appropriateness of meconium screening program development and expansion. The science behind meconium screening at present is not strong enough to warrant widespread implementation of screening; neonatal nurses are cautioned to approach screening carefully because of the critical social implications for mother and baby.",M2
17669569,"Fetal alcohol syndrome and the developing socio-emotional brain.Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is currently recognized as the most common known cause of mental retardation, affecting from 1 to 7 per 1000 live-born infants. Individuals with FAS suffer from changes in brain structure, cognitive impairments, and behavior problems. Researchers investigating neuropsychological functioning have identified deficits in learning, memory, executive functioning, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and poor communication and social skills in individuals with FAS and fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Investigators using autopsy and brain imaging methods have identified microcephaly and structural abnormalities in various regions of the brain (including the basal ganglia, corpus callosum, cerebellum, and hippocampus) that may account for the neuropsychological deficits. Results of studies using newer brain imaging and analytic techniques have indicated specific alterations (i.e., displacements in the corpus callosum, increased gray matter density in the perisylvian regions, altered gray matter asymmetry, and disproportionate reductions in the frontal lobes) in the brains of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol, and their relations with brain function. Future research, including using animal models, could help inform our knowledge of brain-behavior relations in the context of prenatal alcohol exposure, and assist with early identification and intervention.",M2
17640043,"Challenges of diagnosis in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in the adult.Adults with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and the subsets of individuals with attenuated phenotype subsumed under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) provide clinicians with a challenge. Compounding this, FASD is different from most genetic syndromes since a specific diagnostic biological test is not available. The diagnosis first needs to be suspected and confirmation requires a diagnostic assessment that is best carried out in the context of a multi-disciplinary team approach. There is surprisingly little research published on the prevalence, natural history, medical, and social complications relevant to adults with FASD. The evidence that is emerging suggests that this disorder is common, and that services to diagnose and treat these individuals are limited. Adults with FASD have a higher incidence of impairments in social adaptive and executive function, and a higher degree of psychopathology when compared to the general population. The impact of FASD has significant and serious effects on those affected with FASD, their families, and our communities. There is a need for improved access to diagnosis, and more research and evaluation of interventions currently in use. In this paper, we describe the current diagnostic criteria, the differential diagnosis, the prevalence, natural history, the behavioral and mental health consequences, medical and social management issues, and interventions for adults affected with this disorder.",M2
17618743,"Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B genotype and fetal alcohol syndrome: a HuGE minireview.Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), 1 of the most common developmental disabilities in the United States, occurs at a rate of 0.5-2.0:1000 live births. Animal model, family, and twin studies suggest a genetic component to FAS susceptibility. Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the rate-limiting step in alcohol metabolism. Studies of genetic associations with FAS have focused on the alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) gene, comparing mothers and children with the alleles ADH1B*2 or ADH1B*3, associated with faster ethanol metabolism, with those homozygous for ADH1B*1. While most studies have found a protective effect for genotypes containing ADH1B*2 or ADH1B*3, results have been conflicting, and further investigation into the association between the ADH1B genotype and FAS is needed. Whether increased alcohol intake accounts for the elevated risk reported for the ADH1B*1/ADH1B*1 genotype should be addressed, and future studies would benefit from consistent case definitions, enhanced exposure measurements, larger sample sizes, and careful study design.",M2

17550365,"Socio-cognitive habilitation using the math interactive learning experience program for alcohol-affected children.BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) has been recognized as a disabling condition with a significant impact on the neurobehavioral functioning of affected individuals, including cognition, behavior, and academic functioning, but little research has been performed on targeted interventions for these children. METHODS: A socio-cognitive habilitative program focused on improving behavior and math functioning in children 3 to 10 years of age (n=61) was developed and evaluated. The intervention provided parental instruction on FAS, advocacy, and behavioral regulation via workshops and interactive math tutoring with children. All families received parental instruction and were then randomly assigned to either the math instruction or standard psychoeducational care groups. RESULTS: Satisfaction with workshops was very high, with over 90% agreeing that trainers were knowledgeable and materials easy to understand and helpful. Significant gains in knowledge were found for information provided in the instructional groups. At posttesting, caregivers reported fewer problem behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Internalizing Problem Behavior, Externalizing Problem Behavior, and Total Problem Behavior summary scales. After 5 months, both groups of children demonstrated gains in math knowledge but significantly higher gains were found in the group receiving direct math instruction. The math treatment group was also more likely to demonstrate a gain of over 1 standard deviation on any of the 4 math outcome measures used. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that parents of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FAS(D)) benefit from instruction in understanding their child's alcohol-related neurological damage and strategies to provide positive behavioral supports and that targeted psychoeducational programs may be able to remediate some of the math deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",M2
17508618,"[Effects of ethanol on the development of circadian time keeping system]Ethanol exposure during gestation can have devastating consequences on the developing organism. Children who have a history of prenatally exposure to ethanol may show morphological and functional alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), which is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, specific cranial/facial features, and dysfunction of central nervous system, is the most severe end of FASD. FAS or FASD children are known to suffer from disturbance of sleep and/or food intake behaviors. These neuropsychiatric symptoms may be due to impairment of the system regulating circadian rhythms. Recently, animal studies revealed that ethanol exposure during brain development can cause alterations in the circadian rhythm and its regulating system. We examined the effects of pre- or postnatal exposure to ethanol on the circadian rhythm in adulthood by measuring deep body temperature and wheel running activity in rats. After a phase delay in the light/dark cycle, ethanol-exposed rats took longer than control rats to resynchronize to the new light/dark cycle. These results suggest that both pre- and postnatal ethanol exposure impair the development of the circadian clock response to light cue. Because abnormal development of the circadian clock system might contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in FASD, it is believed that normalizing the disturbed rhythm improves the symptoms. However, the mechanisms of dysfunction and potential interventions for disturbance of circadian clock system still remain to be elucidated. Further investigations are required to fully understand long-term effects of ethanol on the development of circadian rhythms.",M2

METHODS: A questionnaire regarding prevalence of FAS/FASD was sent to all Norwegian paediatric and child psychiatry departments. In the region Hordaland county, an information program was carried out to educate health-care and social workers on symptoms and signs of FAS/FASD, and referral was encouraged for suspected cases. Referred children received a neuropaediatric evaluation, and the effect of the information program on recorded FAS/FASD was recorded. RESULTS: Based on the national survey, a prevalence of 0.3 per 1000 was calculated. After the information program, the estimated prevalence in Hordaland County increased to 1.5 per 1000. In 5 years, 25 children were diagnosed with FAS and 22 with FASD. One-third of all children were mentally retarded. Microcephaly and neuroimpairments were more common among FAS children. Almost all children met the criteria of ADHD. CONCLUSION: The rate of FAS/FASD may be greatly underestimated because of lack of knowledge. An information program aimed at health-care and social workers is effective.",M2
17333611,"Estimating the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Victoria using routinely collected administrative data.OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) in Victoria through the Victorian Birth Defects Register (VBDR). METHODS: A sample of live births from 1995-2002 was selected from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection and VBDR based on reported microcephaly, FAS or maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy. Following ethics approval, medical records of mother and child were requested for 117 births. One hundred and nine of these were accessed and examined for factors related to FAS. Records were categorised as FAS, possible FAS, unable to categorise, or not FAS. RESULTS: From the VBDR the prevalence was calculated at 0.006 per 1,000 live births. Four additional possible cases of FAS increased this to 0.014 per 1,000 live births. Six cases were defined as 'unable to categorise' as alcohol use was unknown but other features of FAS were evident. Including these cases, plus five where some low-level alcohol use was reported, increased the prevalence to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. Twenty-eight per cent of the audit population and 39% of the microcephalic cases had no information about maternal alcohol use recorded in the antenatal or babies' records. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The audit of medical records provided additional information regarding FAS prevalence in Victoria. This prevalence ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 per 1,000 live births. To accurately assess the extent of the problem, there needs to be improved reporting of alcohol use in pregnancy and a system in place to report cases diagnosed during and beyond the perinatal period to the VBDR.",M2

Two studies were performed; both compared facial landmark data of FAS and normal subjects, but they differed in the number of landmarks chosen. The first study compared landmarks representing palpebral fissure length, upper lip thinness and philtrum smoothness and revealed no significant difference in shape. The second study added to the landmarks used in the first those affected by mid-face hypoplasia, and revealed significant differences in shape between the two groups, broadly confirming the FAS gestalt reported in the literature. Some disagreement in the characteristic FAS facial shape between our results and those reported in the literature may be due to ethnic variation.",M2
17302851,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and supporting students.BACKGROUND: Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affect a significant number of children in this country. This article addresses diagnostic issues related to fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and other alcohol-related disabilities, discusses associated features and behaviors of FASD, and introduces interventions to support children with FASD in school settings. METHODS: A comprehensive review of FAS and FASD literature as it relates to school functioning was conducted. RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broad range of negative developmental consequences, including deficits in cognitive and academic functioning, psychological disorders, behavioral problems, and difficulties with independent living. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure are at risk for a spectrum of difficulties at school. CONCLUSIONS: This topic is of considerable relevance to all professionals in a school setting, including teachers, administrators, school psychologists, special education providers, special service providers, and school nurses who interact with children who may be prenatally exposed to alcohol. Successful interventions will need to balance the use of environmental modifications, immediate and meaningful positive and negative consequences for behaviors, and opportunities to teach children skills to monitor and modify their behavior.",M2
17294389,"Ocular manifestations in fetal alcohol syndrome.PURPOSE: To report the prevalence of ocular abnormalities in a group of Portuguese children with a complete fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). METHODS: Complete ophthalmologic examination in a sample of consecutive children with FAS. Ocular fundus photography was carried out on the cooperative FAS children and on 25 reference children. Ocular fundus anomalies were recorded by the observation of ocular fundus photography. The ratio between the distance of the center of the disc to the fovea and optic disc diameter (DM/DD) was determined. Small optic disc was defined as a DM/DD ratio above mean control group +1 SD. RESULTS: The authors studied 32 children with FAS (mean age: 9 +/- 5 years; 72% boys). The mean corrected visual acuity (VA) was 0.8 +/- 0.2. Refraction ranged from -23.00 to +6.50 spherical equivalent. Ocular findings included short horizontal palpebral fissure (81% of children), strabismus (28% of children), epicanthus (27% of eyes), blepharoptosis (16% of eyes), telecanthus (13% of children), nystagmus (1 child), and cataract (1 eye). Ocular fundus photography analysis showed retinal vessel tortuosity in 30% of the eyes and optic disc hypoplasia in 25%. The mean DM/DD for the control and FAS groups was 2.72 +/- 0.20 and 2.89 +/- 0.25 (p=0.001). Forty percent of the eyes of FAS children had small optic discs. CONCLUSIONS: The most common ocular findings were anomalies of retinal fundus and minor changes in the outer region of the eyes. The authors noted better VA and less severity of disease than others, which might be due to a different selection of patients, different pattern of alcohol consumption, or genetic differences.",M2
17236896,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in young adulthood.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), with the full phenotype, and fetal alcohol effect (FAE), with some but not all of the features, can be combined under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the long-term sequelae of intrauterine alcohol exposure using physical examination, psychosocial interviews, and a behavioral checklist in a 20-year follow-up study of 37 patients with FASD originally diagnosed as having FAS or FAE in infancy and childhood. RESULTS: Although the characteristic craniofacial malformations of FAS/FAE diminish over time, microcephaly, a poorly developed philtrum and a thin upper lip, and, to a lesser degree, short stature and underweight (in boys) persist. In females, adult body weight increases. Persistent mental handicaps, including intellectual disability, limited occupational options, and dependent living, are the major sequelae, and the scores for various behavioral problems are significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: The devastating effects of intrauterine exposure to alcohol persist into early adulthood and severely limit careers and independent living.",M2

17139684,"How does alcohol impair neuronal migration?Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is the most devastating. Recognized by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition produces severe alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. FAS children experience ataxia; deficits in intellectual functioning; and difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving, and attention. Multiple aspects of central nervous system development can be affected by alcohol exposure, but the most striking abnormalities are neuronal and glial migration. Little is known about cellular mechanisms by which alcohol affects the migration of immature neurons. Recently, it has been found that Ca(2+) signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of the action of alcohol in neuronal cell migration. Most importantly, the aberrant migration of immature neurons caused by alcohol exposure is significantly ameliorated by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways. In this Mini-Review, we first describe how alcohol exposure impairs the migration of cerebellar granule cells and then discuss the signaling mechanisms involved.",M2
17127017,"The epidemiology of fetal alcohol syndrome and partial <e>FAS</e> in a South African community.OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) were determined in a third primary school cohort in a community in South Africa (SA). METHODS: An active case ascertainment, two-tier screening methodology, and the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria were employed among 818 first grade pupils. Characteristics of children with FAS and PFAS are contrasted with a randomly selected control group. Data were collected and analyzed for children in the study regarding: (1) physical growth and development, including dysmorphology, (2) intelligence and behavioral characteristics, and (3) their mother's social, behavioral, and physical characteristics. RESULTS: The rate of FAS and PFAS in this area continues as the highest reported in any overall community and is much higher than rates elsewhere. In this cohort it is 68.0-89.2 per 1000. Severe episodic drinking on weekends among mothers of children with FAS and PFAS accounts for 96% of all alcohol consumed. Various measures of maternal drinking are significantly correlated with negative outcomes of children in the areas of non-verbal intelligence (-0.26), verbal intelligence (-0.28), problem behavior (0.31), and overall dysmorphology score (0.59). Significantly more FAS and PFAS exists among children of rural residents (OR=3.79). CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of FAS and PFAS was again documented in this community, and it has increased. Given population similarities, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa also have high rates. Programs for prevention are needed.",M2
17125425,"Changes in the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy among recent and at-risk drinkers in the NLSY cohort.PURPOSE: To support efforts to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), population-based data are needed on the prevalence of alcohol use at any time during gestation, particularly among women who were recent and at-risk drinkers. METHODS: We used National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences in Youth (NLSY) files to estimate the prevalence of any drinking during pregnancy and to evaluate alcohol history risk factors among 6676 births reported by women with prepregnancy drinking data. Prevalence estimates were obtained for 2-year intervals for all 1982-1995 births and for subsets with prepregnancy recent and at-risk drinking. RESULTS: Among all births, drinking during pregnancy declined from 38.3% in 1982-1983 to 23.0% in 1994-1995 (p &lt; 0.0001). Drinking during pregnancy also declined over time among recent and at-risk drinkers (p &lt; 0.0001), but the 1994-1995 prevalences were still high (39.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Adjusted logistic models confirmed both the decrease in risk for the later birth years and the persistent heightened risk for births among recent and at-risk drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to ongoing universal prevention strategies that have helped reduce the prevalence of drinking during pregnancy, selective and indicated prevention approaches are needed to encourage abstinence during pregnancy among recent and at-risk drinkers.",M2
17117975,"Brain metabolic alterations in adolescents and young adults with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects brain structure and function. This study examined brain metabolism using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and searched for regions of specific vulnerability in adolescents and young adults prenatally exposed to alcohol. METHODS: Ten adolescents and young adults with confirmed heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and a diagnosis within the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) were included. Three of them had fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>), 3 had partial FAS (PFAS), and 4 had alcohol-related neurobehavioral disorder (ARND). The control group consisted of 10 adolescents matched for age, sex, head circumference, handedness, and body mass. Exclusionary criteria were learning disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure. Three-dimensional (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRSI) was performed in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Metabolite ratios N-acetylaspartate/choline (NAA/Cho), NAA/creatine (Cr) and Cho/Cr, and absolute metabolite intensities were calculated for several anatomic regions. RESULTS: In patients with FASD, lower NAA/Cho and/or NAA/Cr compared with controls were found in parietal and frontal cortices, frontal white matter, corpus callosum, thalamus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. There was an increase in the absolute intensity of the glial markers Cho and Cr but no change in the neuronal marker NAA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure alters brain metabolism in a long-standing or permanent manner in multiple brain areas. These changes are in accordance with previous findings from structural and functional studies. Metabolic alterations represent changes in the glial cell pool rather than in the neurons.",M2
17117969,"Comparison of motor delays in young children with fetal alcohol syndrome to those with prenatal alcohol exposure and with no prenatal alcohol exposure.BACKGROUND: Researchers are increasingly considering the importance of motor functioning of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The purpose of this study was to assess the motor development of young children with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) to determine the presence and degree of delay in their motor skills and to compare their motor development with that of matched children without FAS. METHODS: The motor development of 14 children ages 20 to 68 months identified with FAS was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). In addition, 2 comparison groups were utilized. Eleven of the children with FAS were matched for chronological age, gender, ethnicity, and communication age to: (1) 11 children with prenatal alcohol exposure who did not have FAS and (2) 11 matched children without any reported prenatal alcohol exposure. The motor scores on the VABS were compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Most of the young children with FAS in this study showed clinically important delays in their motor development as measured on the VABS Motor Domain, and their fine motor skills were significantly more delayed than their gross motor skills. In the group comparisons, the young children with FAS had significantly lower Motor Domain standard (MotorSS) scores than the children not exposed to alcohol prenatally. They also had significantly lower Fine Motor Developmental Quotients than the children in both the other groups. No significant group differences were found in gross motor scores. For MotorSS scores and Fine Motor Developmental Quotients, the means and standard errors indicated a continuum in the scores from FAS to prenatal alcohol exposure to nonexposure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly suggest that all young children with FAS should receive complete developmental evaluations that include assessment of their motor functioning, to identify problem areas and provide access to developmental intervention programs that target deficit areas such as fine motor skills. Fine motor delays in children with FAS may be related to specific neurobehavioral deficits that affect fine motor skills. The findings support the concept of an FASD continuum in some areas of motor development.",M2
17101024,"Fetal alcohol syndrome and developing craniofacial and dental structures--a review.OBJECTIVES: Fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) is a collection of signs and symptoms seen in children exposed to alcohol in the prenatal period. It is characterized mainly by a distinct pattern of craniofacial malformations, physical and mental retardation. However, with the increased incidence of FAS, there is a great variation in the clinical features of FAS. DESIGN: Narrative review. RESULTS: This review describes data from clinical and experimental studies, and in vitro models. Experimental studies have shown that alcohol has a direct toxic effect on the ectodermal and mesodermal cells of the developing embryo, particularly in the cells destined to give rise to dentofacial structures (i.e. cranial neural crest cells). Other effects, such as, abnormal pattern of cranial and mandibular growth and altered odontogenesis are described in detail. The exact mechanism by which alcohol induces its teratogenic effects remains still unknown. The possible mechanisms are outlined here, with an emphasis on the developing face and tooth. Possible future research directions and treatment strategies are also discussed. CONCLUSION: Early identification of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure leads to interventions, services, and improved outcomes. FAS can be prevented with the elimination of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We need to provide education, target high-risk groups, and make this issue a high priority in terms of public health.",M2
17089955,"[Alcohol consumption, pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome: implications in public health and preventive strategies]Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and is an established cause of serious birth defects and developmental delay collectively described as fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). FAS is caused by congenital alcohol-induced damages and is a cause of mental retardation. It is characterised by facial abnormalities and growth deficiency. Infants affected by the syndrome show intellectual impairment, and difficulties in learning, memory, problem-solving, and attention as well as experiencing additional problems with mental health and social interactions. However, an absence of the characteristic facial defects and growth deficiency may result in a failure to identify children with prenatal alcohol exposure, which can further present as alcohol-related neurodevelopment disorder (ARND) or alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Estimates of prevalence of FAS in U.S.A. range between 0.3 to 2.2 per 1,000 live births, but much higher rates occurring in some communities. Harmonisation of the methodology used for epidemiological studies, with research activities that establishes real baseline prevalence of FAS and identification of women who are at highest risk of bearing a FAS-affected child, are an essential prerequisite to prevention. In addition, it is essential to assess different FAS preventive approaches through carefully controlled studies. Universal, selected, and indicated preventive strategies have been identified, targeting different kind of populations. Since FAS and other adverse effects of drinking during pregnancy are theoretically completely preventable, it is vital to make more efforts to improve the application of the most appropriate interventions. Although in Italy alcohol consumption has constantly increased, mainly amongst the young (including women of childbearing age), knowledge on FAS and alcohol-related effects is completely lacking. Because of the high cost for care of individuals with this syndrome, it is essential to apply appropriate interventions to prevent this problem.",M2
17044897,"Diagnosis of foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol use in pregnancy: a survey of paediatricians' knowledge, attitudes and practice.AIM: To measure paediatricians' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding foetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and alcohol use during pregnancy. METHODS: Postal survey of paediatricians in Western Australia in 2004. Of 179 eligible paediatricians, 132 (73.7%) responded (90 consultant paediatricians and 42 paediatric trainees). RESULTS: Of the 132 respondents, 18.9% identified all four essential diagnostic features for FAS. Only 49.2% had previously diagnosed FAS (range 1-30 cases) but 91.7% had seen children diagnosed by others; 76.5% had suspected but not diagnosed FAS; 12.1% had been convinced of but not recorded the diagnosis; and 31.8% had referred children for diagnostic confirmation. Although 79.6% agreed early diagnosis might be advantageous, 69.6% said diagnosis might be stigmatising and 36.4% thought parents might resist referral for assessment and treatment. Although 78.2% agreed avoiding binge drinking may reduce FAS, only 43.9% believed women should abstain from using alcohol in pregnancy. Only 4.5% felt very prepared to deal with a patient with FAS: most wanted educational materials for themselves (69.7%) and child carers (71.2%). Only 23.3% routinely ask about alcohol use when taking a pregnancy history and 4.2% routinely provide information on the consequences of alcohol use. Only 11.4% had read the current Australian national health guideline regarding alcohol consumption in pregnancy and 9.1% provided advice consistent with the guideline. CONCLUSION: Paediatricians identified the need for educational materials about FAS and alcohol use in pregnancy for themselves and their clients. Lack of knowledge about FAS diagnosis and management will limit opportunities for diagnosis, prevention and early intervention.",M2

17010147,"Diffusion tensor imaging in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is associated with macrostructural brain abnormalities, neurocognitive deficits, and behavioral disturbances, is characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) in severe cases. The only published study thus far using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed microstructural abnormalities in patients with FAS. The current study investigated whether similar abnormalities are present in less severely affected, prenatally exposed patients who did not display all of the typical FAS physical stigmata. METHODS: Subjects included 14 children, ages 10 to 13, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and 13 matched controls. Cases with full-criteria FAS, mental retardation, or microcephaly were excluded. Subjects underwent MRI scans including DTI. RESULTS: Although cases with microcephaly were excluded, there was a trend toward smaller total cerebral volume in the FASD group (p=0.057, Cohen's d effect size =0.73). Subjects with FASD had greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the isthmus of the corpus callosum than controls (p=0.013, effect size =1.05), suggesting microstructural abnormalities in this region. There were no group differences in 5 other regions of the corpus callosum. Correlations between MD in the isthmus and facial dysmorphology were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that even relatively mild forms of fetal alcohol exposure may be associated with microstructural abnormalities in the posterior corpus callosum that are detectable with DTI.",M2

Executive functions explained a significant percentage of variance in parent and teacher rated social skills. No differences were found among children with diagnoses of <e>FAS</e>, partial FAS, or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. It may be helpful to consider executive functioning in designing social skills interventions for alcohol-exposed children whether or not they have full FAS.",M2

METHODS: Fathers who had American Indian children with FAS (Study 1) or incomplete FAS (Study 2) were compared with fathers whose children did not have FAS. RESULTS: About half of case and control fathers had alcohol use and alcohol-related medical problems documented in their medical records. Case fathers were more likely to receive alcohol treatment and have injuries related to alcohol abuse. CONCLUSION: Significantly more fathers of children with FAS were referred for alcohol treatment, received alcohol treatment, experienced injuries, and had delirium tremens than control fathers.

16930219,"Epidemiology of FASD in a province in Italy: Prevalence and characteristics of children in a random sample of schools.BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of the prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a Western European population are lacking and are of particular interest in settings where the usual pattern of alcohol consumption is thought to be daily drinking with meals. To address these issues, an epidemiology study of FAS and other FASD was undertaken in Italian schools. METHODS: Primary schools (n = 25) in 2 health districts of the Lazio region were randomly selected and recruited for the study. Five hundred forty-three children, 50% of those enrolled in first-grade classes, received parental permission to participate in a 2-tiered, active case ascertainment screening process. Detailed evaluation of children selected in a preliminary screening phase was carried out on those who were small for height, weight, and head circumference and/or referred by teachers for suspected learning and behavioral problems. Detailed evaluation was carried out on each child's: (1) physical growth and dysmorphology, (2) psychological development and behavior, and (3) prenatal exposure to alcohol and other risk factors for FASD via maternal interviews. A group of 67 randomly selected children without FASD from the same classes was utilized as a comparison group. RESULTS: Using 2 denominators for prevalence estimation, a conservative one and a strict sample-based estimate, the prevalence of FAS in this province of Italy was 3.7 to 7.4 per 1,000 children. When cases of partial FAS (PFAS) and a case of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental deficits (ARND) were added to FAS cases, the rate of FASD was 20.3 to 40.5 per 1,000 and estimated at 35 per 1,000 overall or between 2.3 and 4.1% of all children. This exceeds previously published estimates of both FAS and FASD for the western world. Detailed data are presented that demonstrate the utility of the guidelines of the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria for FASD. Children with FASD are significantly more impaired/affected (p &lt; 0.05) than randomly selected comparison children on all measures of growth deficiency, key facial features of FASD, overall dysmorphology scores, language comprehension, nonverbal IQ, and behavior. Maternal reports of current drinking were significantly higher for mothers of FASD children than comparison mothers, but reported rates of overall drinking during pregnancy were not significantly different. In contrast to expectations, daily drinking among mothers of the comparison group was not common. However, dysmorphology scores of the children were significantly correlated with drinking in the second and third trimesters, drinks per current drinking day, and current drinks per month. Finally, children with the physical features of FASD had lower IQs; nonverbal IQ was significantly correlated with head circumference and negatively correlated with overall dysmorphology score, smooth philtrum, and several other facial and physical anomalies characteristic of FAS. CONCLUSIONS: Using careful measures of ascertainment in a primary school setting, these results provide relatively high estimates of the prevalence of FASD and raise the question of whether FASD is more common in the western world than previously estimated.",M2
16908065,"Metabolic and genetic factors contributing to alcohol induced effects and fetal alcohol syndrome.Alcohol-related damages on newborns and infants include a wide variety of complications from facial anomalies to neurodevelopmental delay, known as fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). However, only less than 10% of women drinking alcohol during pregnancy have children with FAS. Understanding the risk factors increasing the probability for newborn exposed in utero to alcohol to develop FAS is therefore a key issue. The involvement of genetics as a one risk factor in FAS has been suggested by animal models and by molecular epidemiological studies on different populations, bearing allelic variants for those enzymes, such as ADH e CYP2E1, involved in ethanol metabolism. Indeed, one of the major factors determining the peak blood alcohol exposure to the fetus is the metabolic activity of the mother, in addition to placental and fetal metabolism, explaining, at least partially, the risk of FAS. The different rates of ethanol metabolism may be the result of genetic polymorphisms, the most relevant of which have been described in the paper.",M2
16965894,"Games that  work : using computer games to teach alcohol-affected children about fire and street safety.Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability for children. Those with developmental disabilities, including children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, are at highest risk for injuries. Although teaching safety skills is recommended to prevent injury, cognitive limitations and behavioral problems characteristic of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder make teaching these skills challenging for parents and teachers. In the current study, 32 children, ages 4-10, diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>) and partial FAS, learned fire and street safety through computer games that employed  virtual worlds  to teach recommended safety skills. Children were pretested on verbal knowledge of four safety elements for both fire and street safety conditions and then randomly assigned to one condition. After playing the game until mastery, children were retested verbally and asked to  generalize  their newly acquired skills in a behavioral context. They were retested after 1 week follow-up. Children showed significantly better knowledge of the game to which they were exposed, immediately and at follow-up, and the majority (72%) was able to generalize all four steps within a behavioral setting. Results suggested that this is a highly effective method for teaching safety skills to high-risk children who have learning difficulties.",M2
16962173,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: a practical clinical approach to diagnosis.In utero exposure to alcohol can have numerous adverse effects on a developing fetus. These effects represent a spectrum of structural anomalies and neurocognitive and behavioral disabilities that have recently been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Children at the most severe end of this spectrum and displaying the complete phenotype of characteristic facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system are defined as having fetal alcohol syndrome (<e>FAS</e>). While FAS is the most readily clinically recognized form of FASD, other categories within the continuum of adverse effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure are becoming better defined. These include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). As more is learned regarding the exact manifestations of alcohol on brain development, these classifications may be expanded and/or refined. Because FASD represents a major public health concern, early recognition of at-risk children is important for initiating interventional strategies. Thus, the purpose of this report is to educate practicing physicians about the recognizable phenotypes of FASD in order to accurately identify these children and implement the most appropriate management plans.",M2
