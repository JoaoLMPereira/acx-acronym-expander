20447532,"Copeptin improves early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.OBJECTIVES: Early identification of myocardial infarction in chest pain patients is crucial to identify patients at risk and to maintain a fast treatment initiation. BACKGROUND: The aim of the current investigation is to test whether determination of copeptin, an indirect marker for arginin-vasopressin, adds diagnostic information to cardiac troponin in early evaluation of patients with suspected myocardial infarction. METHODS: Between January 2007 and July 2008, patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were consecutively enrolled in this multicenter study. Copeptin, troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), myoglobin, and creatine kinase-myocardial band were determined at admission and after 3 and 6 h. RESULTS: Of 1,386 (66.4% male) enrolled patients, 299 (21.6%) had the discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, 184 (13.3%) presented with unstable angina, and in 903 (65.2%) an acute coronary syndrome could be excluded. Combined measurement of copeptin and TnT on admission improved the c-statistic from 0.84 for TnT alone to 0.93 in the overall population and from 0.77 to 0.9 in patients presenting within 3 h after chest pain onset (CPO) (p &lt; 0.001). In this group the combination of copeptin with a conventional TnT provided a negative predictive value of 92.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In triage of chest pain patients, determination of copeptin in addition to troponin improves diagnostic performance, especially early after CPO. Combined determination of troponin and copeptin provides a remarkable negative predictive value virtually independent of CPO time and therefore aids in early and safe rule-out of myocardial infarction.",M1
20418479,"Coexistence of cardiac troponin T variants reduces heart efficiency.Corresponding to the synchronized contraction of the myocardium and rhythmic pumping function of the heart, a single form of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is present in the adult cardiac muscle of humans and most other vertebrate species. Alternative splicing variants of cTnT are found in failing human hearts and animal dilated cardiomyopathies. Biochemical analyses have shown that these cTnT variants are functional and produce shifted myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. We proposed a hypothesis that the coexistence of two or more functionally distinct <e>TnT</e> variants in the adult ventricular muscle that is normally activated as a syncytium may decrease heart function and cause cardiomyopathy (Huang et al., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 294: C213-C222, 2008). In the present study, we studied transgenic mouse hearts expressing one or two cTnT variants in addition to normal adult cTnT to investigate whether desynchronized myofilament activation decreases ventricular efficiency. The function of ex vivo working hearts was examined in the absence of systemic neurohumoral influence. The results showed that the transgenic mouse hearts produced lower maximum left ventricular pressure, slower contractile and relaxation velocities, and decreased stroke volume compared with wild-type controls. Ventricular pumping efficiency, calculated by the ejection integral versus total systolic integral and cardiac work versus oxygen consumption, was significantly lower in transgenic mouse hearts and corresponded to the number of cTnT variants present. The results indicated a pathogenic mechanism in which the coexistence of functionally different cTnT variants in cardiac muscle reduces myocardial efficiency due to desynchronized thin filament activation.",M1
20233242,"Prognostic efficacy of cardiac biomarkers for mortality in dialysis patients.BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of cardiovascular mortality in the end-stage renal disease population is well established. The aim of this current study was to document the relative prognostic significance of established cardiac biomarkers troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), troponin I (TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) in this population. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of dialysis patients undertaken in a single tertiary centre in Australia. Relevant clinical and biochemical information was collected at entry and all patients followed up prospectively without any loss to follow up. End-point of interest was all-cause mortality. Statistical analysis using Cox proportional hazards was used to study relationship between competing covariates and outcome. A total of 143 patients with a mean age of 59.67 +/- 15.49 years was followed up for a median duration of 30 months. Of these patients, 89.3% were white Australians of European ancestry. Twenty-seven per cent had an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The mean concentrations (+/-SD) of TnT, TnI, BNP and N-terminal peptide pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) were 0.08 +/- 0.04 microg/L, 0.09 +/- 0.2 microg/L, 270 +/- 117 ng/L and 1434 +/- 591 ng/L respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight subjects died during the period of follow up. By univariate analysis, all cardiac markers (TnT, TnI, BNP, NT-pro-BNP and C-reactive protein) were significantly associated with an increase in mortality. On Cox proportionate hazards analysis, only albumin and NT-pro-BNP showed a significant association with mortality, with hazard ratios of 0.834, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.779-0.893, P &lt; 0.001, and 1.585, 95%CI 1.160-20165, P = 0.004 respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with end-stage renal failure on dialysis NT-pro-BNP provides greater prognostic information compared with TnT and TnI.",M1
20201171,"Admission creatine kinase as a prognostic marker in acute myocardial infarction.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic significance of creatine kinase (CK) in Pakistani patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to find out if CK combined with troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) could be a better predictor for long-term adverse cardiac event. METHODS: One hundred and eighty six consecutive patients with AMI who were eligible for streptokinase (SK) treatment were included in this prospective cohort study. The relationship between their serum/plasma CK and TnT levels at the time of admission and clinical outcome was investigated over a mean follow up of 24.12 +/- 3.75 months. RESULTS: Admission CK was found to be associated with subsequent cardiac event and mortality (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.04 respectively). Admission CK was also mildly associated with time interval between onset of symptoms to SK treatment (correlation coefficient 'r' = 0.23). Odds of encountering a cardiac event in AMI patients with above-normal CK levels (adjusted for gender) were 3.46 times higher than the odds in patients with normal CK levels. Similarly, odds of mortality in patients with positive TnT were 4.6 times the odds in patients with negative TnT. The two biochemical markers, CK and TnT, together did not provide any further information about prognosis of the disease. CONCLUSION: Admission CK is a better prognostic marker for a subsequent cardiac event, while TnT is a better predictor of mortality over a mean follow up of nearly 2 years. Together, they do not improve predictability of an adverse cardiac event.",M1
20129526,"The association between plaque characterization by CT angiography and post-procedural myocardial infarction in patients with elective stent implantation.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the association between volumetric characterization of target lesions by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography and the risk of post-procedural myocardial injury after elective stent implantation. BACKGROUND: Previous reports have shown that plaque characterization of the target lesion may provide useful information for stratifying the risk of coronary stenting. METHODS: A total of 189 consecutive patients were enrolled; they underwent elective stent implantation after volumetric plaque analysis with 64-slice MDCT. Each plaque component and lumen (filled with dye) was defined as follows: 1) low-attenuation plaque (LAP) (&lt;50 HU); 2) moderate-attenuation plaque (MAP) (50 to 150 HU); 3) lumen (151 to 500 HU); and 4) high-attenuation plaque (HAP) (&gt;500 HU). The volume of each plaque component in the target lesion was calculated using Color Code Plaque. Post-procedural creatine kinase-MB isoform and troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>) at 18 h after percutaneous coronary intervention were also evaluated. RESULTS: The volumes of LAP (87.9+/-94.8 mm3 vs. 47.4+/-43.7 mm3, p&lt;0.01) and MAP (111.6+/-77.5 mm3 vs. 89.8+/-67.1 mm3, p&lt;0.05) were larger in patients with post-procedural myocardial injury (defined as positive TnT) than in those with negative TnT. The volumes of LAP and MAP and fraction of LAP in total plaque (LAP volume/total plaque volume) correlated with biomarkers; the MAP fraction was inversely correlated with biomarkers. The volume of LAP was an independent predictor of positive TnT after adjusting for patient background, conventional IVUS parameters, and procedural factors. CONCLUSIONS: Post-procedural myocardial injury was associated with the volume and fraction of LAP as detected by MDCT. The volume of LAP was an independent predictor of positive TnT. Plaque analysis by MDCT would be a useful method for predicting post-procedural myocardial injury after percutaneous coronary intervention.",M1
20093942,"Prognostic value of stable troponin T elevation in patients discharged from emergency department.OBJECTIVE: Troponin elevation in the absence of myocardial infarction is a challenging diagnostic problem in the emergency department (ED). Elevated troponin levels have a short-term negative prognostic value in critically ill patients hospitalized for all causes. No data are available about the short-term prognostic value of elevated troponin in ED patients discharged from hospital without clinical evidence of acute diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the short-term prognostic value of elevated stable troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) in ED patients discharged from hospital. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-two consecutive adult individuals admitted to ED evaluation for all causes, with TnT test and without evidence of acute diseases requiring hospitalization, were evaluated. The patients with TnT positive tests, without dynamic changes during in-hospital observation and discharged from hospital, were considered as case patients. For each case patient enrolled, the consecutive patient of the same sex and similar age, admitted to the ED on the same day and discharged with normal plasma TnT values, was enrolled as her/his control. The incidence of adverse clinical events in both cases and controls assessed by a phone call at 24 h, 7 days and 30 days after the ED discharge was recorded. RESULTS: Ninety-four cases and 94 controls were finally considered. The 30-day adverse events (death, hospitalization and ED access) were 35 of the 94 (37.2%) in cases and 18 of the 94 (19.1%) in controls (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The patients discharged from ED with stable elevated TnT levels, but without acute diseases, had a short-term prognosis worse than that of patients with similar clinical presentation but with normal TnT values.",M1
19959623,"Analytical validation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay.BACKGROUND: We report the development of a novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay, a modification of the Roche fourth-generation cTnT assay, and validation of the analytical performance of this assay. METHODS: Validation included testing of analytical sensitivity, specificity, interferences, and precision. We established the 99th percentile cutoff from healthy reference populations (n = 616). In addition, we studied differences in time to a positive result when using serial measurements of hs-cTnT vs cTnT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI). RESULTS: The hs-cTnT assay had an analytical range from 3 to 10 000 ng/L. At the 99th percentile value of 13.5 ng/L, the CV was 9% using the Elecsys 2010 analyzer. The assay was specific for cTnT without interferences from human cTnI or cTnC, skeletal muscle <e>TnT</e>, or hemoglobin concentrations up to 1000 mg/L, above which falsely lower values would be expected. When the assay was evaluated clinically, a hs-cTnT higher than the 99th percentile concentration identified a significantly higher number of patients with non-STEMI on presentation (45 vs 20 patients, P = 0.0004) compared with cTnT, and a final diagnosis of non-STEMI was made in 9 additional patients (55 vs 46 patients, P = 0.23) after serial sampling. Time to diagnosis was significantly shorter using hs-cTnT compared with cTnT [mean 71.5 (SD 108.7) min vs 246.9 (82.0) min, respectively; P &lt; 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: The analytical performance of hs-cTnT complies with the ESC-ACCF-AHA-WHF Global Task Force recommendations for use in the diagnosis of MI.",M1
19952495,"Characteristics of troponins as myocardial damage biomarkers in cynomolgus monkeys.Recently, troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and troponin I (TnI) have been reported as suitable biomarkers of myocardial injury for pre-clinical toxicity studies. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of troponins as myocardial damage biomarkers in cynomolgus monkeys. Initially, tissue distribution of biomarkers was investigated in nine organs (including the heart, liver, and kidneys) collected from naive cynomolgus monkeys. The results showed that TnT and TnI were distributed specifically in the heart, and were not detected in other tissues. Secondly, changes in blood biomarker levels and histopathological changes in cardiac tissue were investigated following myocardial injury induced by concomitant administration of isoproterenol (ISO) and vasopressin (VASO). Compared with pre-dosing, TnT and TnI were markedly increased in the ISO + VASO groups, in which severe histopathological changes including necrosis and vacuolation of muscle fibers were observed. In order to investigate the relationship of biomarker levels with the severity of myocardial injury, Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between C(max) and AUC and necrosis and vacuolation scores in the heart. A high correlation between necrosis and vacuolation in the heart and TnT and TnI levels was noted. These results suggest that TnT and TnI possess high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury in cynomolgus monkeys, and are useful biomarkers for detection of drug-induced myocardial injury in cynomolgus monkeys.",M1
19944557,"ADAMTS4 level in patients with stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes.OBJECTIVE: A recent study indicates that ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 4) was expressed in macrophage rich areas of human atherosclerotic carotid plaques and coronary unstable plaques suggesting a pathogenic role in the development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The aim of the study was to compare ADAMTS4 across the entire spectrum of coronary artery disease (CAD) and to investigate the temporal profiles of ADAMTS4. METHODS: Plasma levels of ADAMTS4 were measured in patients with stable effort angina pectoris (SAP), ACS and in controls. Venous blood was sampled upon admission before angiography and drug administration. In patients with ACS who underwent medical treatment, serial blood samples were also collected on days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 after admission. ADAMTS4 was measured using an enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Plasma ADAMTS4 level in cases was significantly greater than in controls (P&lt;0.001). Higher levels of ADAMTS4 were found with progression of CAD from SAP to unstable angina pectoris (UAP) to non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and to ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) (P&lt;0.001). Elevated ADAMTS4 level was associated with ACS with an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.753 (95% CI 0.654-0.851; P&lt;0.001). The pattern of ADAMTS4 release observed was clearly different in various forms of ACS. ADAMTS4 showed a weak correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); however, no significant correlation was found between ADAMTS4 and troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) in ACS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serial changes in plasma ADAMTS4 were documented in patients with ACS and may serve as a marker of plaque destabilization.",M1
19932239,"12-month outcome after cardiac surgery: prediction by troponin T in combination with the European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation.BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of troponin T for midterm outcome in cardiac surgery is insufficiently known. We aimed to assess the value of troponin T to predict 12-month outcome after cardiac surgery, as a single predictor and in combination with the European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation (EuroSCORE). METHODS: This cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery between January 2005 and December 2006. We evaluated postoperative troponin T (<e>TNT</e>) on days 1 and 2 and the EuroSCORE as predictor variables. The primary composite endpoint was all-cause mortality or any major adverse cardiac event (MACE) at 12 months. Logistic regression was used to study the prognostic effect of TNT in a univariate analysis and after adjustment for EuroSCORE. The area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) was calculated to report the discriminatory performance of the models. RESULTS: Seven hundred forty-one patients were available for analysis. Within 12 months after surgery, 92 (12.4%) patients had a MACE, 48 (6.5%) of whom died. A multivariate model of continuous TNT and the continuous logistic EuroSCORE showed a significant independent association between TNT and the composite endpoint (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.04 per 0.1 microg/L increase in TNT). The AUC for the prediction of the composite endpoint of the model combining TNT and the EuroSCORE was 0.72; when based on EuroSCORE alone it was 0.64 (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative TNT increase (per 0.1 microg/L) is a strong independent predictor of 12-month outcome after on-pump cardiac surgery. Updating the preoperative EuroSCORE risk with postoperative TNT allows for better prediction of 12-month MACE and all-cause mortality.",M1
19920153,"Troponin regulatory function and dynamics revealed by H/D exchange-mass spectrometry.Muscle contraction is tightly regulated by Ca(2+) binding to the thin filament protein troponin. The mechanism of this regulation was investigated by detailed mapping of the dynamic properties of cardiac troponin using amide hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry. Results were obtained in the presence of either saturation or non-saturation of the regulatory Ca(2+) binding site in the NH(2) domain of subunit TnC. Troponin was found to be highly dynamic, with 60% of amides exchanging H for D within seconds of exposure to D(2)O. In contrast, portions of the <e>TnT</e>-TnI coiled-coil exhibited high protection from exchange, despite 6 h in D(2)O. The data indicate that the most stable portion of the trimeric troponin complex is the coiled-coil. Regulatory site Ca(2+) binding altered dynamic properties (i.e. H/D exchange protection) locally, near the binding site and in the TnI switch helix that attaches to the Ca(2+)-saturated TnC NH(2) domain. More notably, Ca(2+) also altered the dynamic properties of other parts of troponin: the TnI inhibitory peptide region that binds to actin, the TnT-TnI coiled-coil, and the TnC COOH domain that contains the regulatory Ca(2+) sites in many invertebrate as opposed to vertebrate troponins. Mapping of these affected regions onto the troponin highly extended structure suggests that cardiac troponin switches between alternative sets of intramolecular interactions, similar to previous intermediate resolution x-ray data of skeletal muscle troponin.",M1
19900412,"Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of native thin filaments reveal species-specific differences in regulatory strand densities.Throughout the animal kingdom striated muscle contraction is regulated by the thin filament troponin-tropomyosin complex. Homologous regulatory components are shared among vertebrate and arthropod muscles; however, unique protein extensions and/or components characterize the latter. The Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) isoforms of Drosophila indirect flight and tarantula femur muscle for example contain distinct C-terminal extensions and are approximately 20% larger overall than their vertebrate counterpart. Using electron microscopy and three-dimensional helical reconstruction of native Drosophila, tarantula and frog muscle thin filaments we have identified species-specific differences in tropomyosin regulatory strand densities. The strands on the arthropod thin filaments were significantly larger in diameter than those from vertebrates, although not significantly different from each other. These findings reflect differences in the regulatory troponin-tropomyosin complex, which are likely due to the larger TnT molecules aligning and extending along much of the tropomyosin strands' length. Such an arrangement potentially alters the physical properties of the regulatory strands and may help establish contractile characteristics unique to certain arthropod muscles.",M1
19836941,"Potential of a simplified measurement scheme and device structure for a low cost label-free point-of-care capacitive biosensor.A simplified measurement scheme and device structure aiming at developing a low cost, label-free, point-of-care capacitive biosensor were investigated. The detection principle is the increase of low frequency capacitance between two planar Al electrodes observed after antibody-antigen interaction. The electrodes, deposited on oxidized Si wafers, were covered with an antibody layer, with and without using self-assembled thiol monolayer. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) were used as analytes to asses this proposal. The device was able to detect successfully TnT levels in the range 0.07 to 6.83ng/mL in human serum from patients with cardiac diseases and in the range 0.01ng/mL to 5ng/mL for TnT in phosphate buffer saline. An equivalent circuit model able to reproduce the general behavior of experimental capacitance versus frequency curves was presented. The investigated features that have potential to reduce costs and simplify measurements were: use of single, low frequency (1kHz) measurement signal, within the range of low cost portable capacitance meters; employment of a lower cost electrode material, aluminum, instead of gold electrodes; and use of simple and miniaturized planar two-electrodes arrangement, thus making a portable system for point-of-care applications.",M1
19812120,"Cardiac biomarkers in a model of acute catecholamine cardiotoxicity.Coronary heart disease and in particular its most serious form - acute myocardial infarction (AMI) - represents the most common cause of mortality in developed countries. Better prognosis may be achieved by understanding the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of AMI. Therefore, a catecholamine model of myocardial injury, which has appeared to be very similar to AMI in human in some aspect, was used. Male Wistar:Han rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (saline) and isoprenaline group (ISO; synthetic catecholamine, 100 mg.kg(- 1) subcutaneously [s.c.]). After 24 hours, functional parameters were measured, biochemical markers in the blood and metals content in the heart tissue were analysed and histological examination was performed. ISO caused marked myocardial injury that was associated with myocardial calcium overload. Close correlation between myocardial impairment (i.e. serum <e>TnT</e>, stroke volume index and wet ventricles weight) and the levels of myocardial calcium was observed. Direct reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was documented only by non-significant increase in malonyldialdehyde 24 hours after ISO injury. Moreover, myocardial element analysis revealed no significant changes as for the content of zinc and iron while selenium and copper increased in the ISO group although it reached statistical significance only for the latter.",M1
19797054,"Deletion of a genomic segment containing the cardiac troponin I gene knocks down expression of the slow troponin T gene and impairs fatigue tolerance of diaphragm muscle.The loss of slow skeletal muscle troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) results in a recessive nemaline myopathy in the Amish featured with lethal respiratory failure. The genes encoding slow TnT and cardiac troponin I (TnI) are closely linked. Ex vivo promoter analysis suggested that the 5'-enhancer region of the slow TnT gene overlaps with the structure of the upstream cardiac TnI gene. Using transgenic expression of exogenous cardiac TnI to rescue the postnatal lethality of a mouse line in which the entire cardiac TnI gene was deleted, we investigated the effect of enhancer deletion on slow TnT gene expression in vivo and functional consequences. The levels of slow TnT mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in the diaphragm muscle of adult double transgenic mice. The slow TnT-deficient (ssTnT-KD) diaphragm muscle exhibited atrophy and decreased ratios of slow versus fast isoforms of TnT, TnI, and myosin. Consistent with the changes toward more fast myofilament contents, ssTnT-KD diaphragm muscle required stimulation at higher frequency for optimal tetanic force production. The ssTnT-KD diaphragm muscle also exhibited significantly reduced fatigue tolerance, showing faster and more declines of force with slower and less recovery from fatigue as compared with the wild type controls. The natural switch to more slow fiber contents during aging was partially blunted in the ssTnT-KD skeletal muscle. The data demonstrated a critical role of slow TnT in diaphragm function and in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Amish nemaline myopathy.",M1
19690080,"Troponin T and pro-B-type natriuretic Peptide in fetuses of type 1 diabetic mothers.OBJECTIVE: Cardiomyopathy is noted in up to 40% of infants of diabetic mothers, and the exact mechanisms are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether fetal serum markers of cardiac function differ between normal and type 1 diabetic pregnancies and to examine the relationship between these markers and fetal cardiac structure and function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of 45 type 1 diabetic pregnancies and 39 normal pregnancies. All participants had concentrations of fetal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) and troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>) measured at the time of delivery. All patients with type 1 diabetes had Doppler evaluation of the umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus in the third trimester, and a subset (n = 21) had detailed fetal echocardiograms performed in each trimester. RESULTS: Fetal proBNP and TnT concentrations were higher in the diabetic cohort than in the normal cohort (P &lt; 0.05). ProBNP correlated positively with interventricular septum thickness (P &lt; 0.05) but not with cardiac function indexes in the third trimester. In patients with poor glycemic control, there was a significant positive correlation (P &lt; 0.05) between fetal TnT and the third trimester umbilical artery pulsatility index. There were also increased levels of fetal TnT in infants with poor perinatal outcome (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical markers of cardiac dysfunction are elevated in infants of diabetic mothers, especially those with cardiomyopathy or poor perinatal outcome. Hyperglycemia in early pregnancy may affect myocardial and placental development, thus contributing to the susceptibility to hypoxia seen in these infants.",M1
19638365,"Aggressive statin therapy in multicenter and effectiveness for the reduction of intra-myocardial damage caused by non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: AMERICA study.BACKGROUND: While preprocedural statin treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is widely regarded as beneficial, there has been no prospective randomized multicenter trial of patients with non-ST elevation ACS in the Japanese population to examine the efficacy of preprocedural aggressive statin use. The aim of this study was to confirm this effect by prospective randomized multicenter design. METHODS: Fifty patients who presented with non-ST elevation ACS were enrolled, and randomly assigned to aggressive statin administration before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>), creatine phosphokinase (CK), CK-myocardial band (CK-MB), high-sense C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured at baseline and/ or after procedure. RESULTS: Three days after PCI, the statin group had significantly less CK elevation compared with the nonstatin group (84+/-17 IU/l versus 180+/-68 IU/l, respectively, p = 0.02). CK-MB elevation also tended to be lower in the statin group than in the nonstatin group (3.2+/-1.9 versus. 7.0+/-3.0, respectively, p = 0.07), as was BNP level (3.2+/-1.9 versus 7.0+/-3.0 pg/ml, respectively, p = 0.07). The change of serum LDL cholesterol was significantly correlated with CK (p = 0.01) and TnT (p = 0.02) at 1 day after PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive statin usage before PCI to Japanese patients with non-ST elevation ACS appears to reduce myocardial damage after procedure. The degree of serum lipid level reduction may reflect the vulnerability of atheromatous plaques that could cause cardiac damage after PCI.",M1
19541721,"Troponin T predicts in-hospital and 1-year mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism.We aimed to determine the prognostic value of troponin T (<e>TNT</e>) for in-hospital and 1-yr mortality in a large sample of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients presenting at the emergency department of a tertiary care centre from January 1998 to December 2006 with PE were included. A blood sample was taken at the time of presentation. To determine in-hospital and 1-yr mortality, data from the hospital records and the national death register were used. TNT was determined in 563 out of 737 patients with proven PE. TNT was elevated (&gt;0.03 ng x mL(-1)) in 27%. In-hospital survival was 79% in TNT-positive patients compared with 94% in TNT-negative patients (p&lt;0.001). 1-yr survival was 71% in TNT-positive patients compared with 90% in TNT-negative patients (p&lt;0.001). Elevated TNT levels meant a four-times higher risk of in-hospital death and a three-times higher risk of 1-yr mortality, even after adjustment for the other most important risk factors of death in this population. Elevated TNT independently predicts in-hospital and 1-yr mortality in patients with acute PE.",M1
19505796,"Myocardial function in older male amateur marathon runners: assessment by tissue Doppler echocardiography, speckle tracking, and cardiac biomarkers.BACKGROUND: Participation of older men in endurance races continues to increase. Recent studies on marathon runners raised concerns about a transient myocardial dysfunction and damage. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of marathon-induced myocardial dysfunction in young and older runners and to identify its potential correlation to elevated cardiac biomarkers. METHODS: Twenty-eight older (aged 60-72 years) and 50 younger (22-59 years) male amateur athletes who participated in the 2006 Berlin Marathon were included in the study and examined by echocardiography (including tissue Doppler and speckle tracking echocardiography) and blood tests (including troponin T [<e>TnT</e>], N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) before, immediately after, and 2 weeks after the race. RESULTS: Immediately after the marathon, there was no sign of systolic myocardial dysfunction (increase in fractional shortening, baseline 39.9% +/- 7.6% vs post 46.8% +/- 9.2%, P &lt; .001, unchanged septal basal longitudinal 2-dimensional strain: 17.1% +/- 2.9%, 17.7% +/- 3.2%, P = .11). As a marker of diastolic function, E/E' was not altered significantly (7.6 +/- 2.1, 8.7 +/- 3.5, P = .15). The deceleration time of E and E' decreased in both groups immediately after the race, indicating a transient adaptation of diastolic myocardial function. Strain of the right ventricular free wall was decreased in the mid and apical segments after the race in both groups with normalization during follow-up. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was not altered. Some 53.8% of all runners had increases in TnT or NT-proBNP after the race. Some 32% of controls and 29% of older runners had elevated levels of NT-proBNP (P = .75, TnT: 44% vs 29% P = .18). There was no correlation between NT-proBNP and TnT increase. The increases in biomarkers were not correlated to echocardiography parameters of systolic, diastolic, or right-sided heart dysfunction or to age, training level, running time, or renal function. All parameters returned to normal ranges after 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Left ventricular systolic function is preserved after a marathon in older runners. There are right ventricular functional changes as a sign of prolonged myocardial work load. There is no significant difference between older and young runners regarding transient diastolic dysfunction or biomarker release. The latter is not associated with echocardiography parameters of myocardial dysfunction.",M1
19462275,"Contribution of renal function impairment to unexplained troponin T elevations in congestive heart failure.BACKGROUND: Patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) often have unexplained elevations in serum concentrations of troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), and it is proposed that this is due to cardiac TnT release because of underlying cardiac disease. We investigated whether impaired renal function is an additional underlying phenomenon contributing to increased TnT levels in patients with CHF. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with nonischemic CHF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, with normal coronary angiogram and normal serum creatinine were included in the study. Baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the Cockcroft Gault equation. RESULTS: Although mean creatinine level was normal (0.92 +/- 0.17 mg/dL), mean GFR was low (56 +/- 16 mL/min) in the cohort. Elevated (&gt;or=0.02 microg/L) TnT was measured in 33 patients (53%). Compared with patients with normal (&lt;0.02 microg/L) TnT levels, patients with elevated TnT had significantly higher NYHA class (p = 0.02), longer duration of disease (p = 0.02), lower GFR (p = 0.0001), and lower LVEF (p = 0.0001). There were significant associations between TnT levels and duration of disease (r = 0.29, p = 0.01), creatinine (r = 0.30, p = 0.01), GFR (r = -0.55, p &lt; 0.0001), and LVEF (r = -0.39, p = 0.001). Independence of these associations was evaluated in multiple linear regression analysis, and serum TnT was independently and negatively associated only with GFR (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Renal function (GFR) correlated significantly and more strongly than cardiac function (LVEF) with the serum TnT levels in patients with CHF. This supports our hypothesis that impaired renal function causes the accumulation of troponin and is very likely the cause of unexplained elevations of serum TnT in patients severe CHF.",M1
19395545,"Nonmyofilament-associated troponin T fragments induce apoptosis.Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) is a striated muscle-specific protein and an abundant component of the myofilaments. Nonmyofilament-associated TnT is rapidly degraded in myocytes, implying an importance in the maintenance of the cellular environment. However, if the level of nonmyofilament-associated TnT or TnT fragments exceeds the degradation capacity, it may cause cytotoxicity. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed bicistronic vectors to express different portions of TnT polypeptide chain, together with nonfusion green fluorescent protein as a tracer for the transfection. Cytotoxicity of the TnT fragments was studied through forced expression in C(2)C(12) myoblasts and human embryonic kidney-293 nonmuscle cells and examination of the viability of the transfected cells. The results demonstrated that, in the absence of myofilaments, the conserved COOH-terminal and middle fragments of TnT were highly effective on inducing cell death via apoptosis, whereas the NH(2)-terminal variable region was not. As combined effects, nonmyofilament-associated intact cardiac TnT and a COOH-terminal truncated slow TnT fragment found in Amish nemaline myopathy exhibited intermediate cytotoxicity. A particular significance of this finding is that peak releases of TnT or TnT fragments from decomposition of a large number of myofibrils in acute myocardial infarction may breach the cellular protection of proteolytic degradation and result in apoptosis as a potential cause for the loss of cardiomyocytes.",M1
19362143,"Neutrophil activation precedes myocardial injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein abundantly expressed and secreted by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), has emerged as a critical mediator in coronary atherosclerosis. Retrospective analyses have suggested that free plasma levels of MPO predict adverse outcome in patients with low troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) levels who subsequently experience myocardial injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time course of MPO plasma levels in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Of 155 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes, 38 presenting within 2 h of the onset of symptoms and subsequently diagnosed for AMI were included in the study. Serial blood samples taken between 1 and 24 h after the onset of chest pain were analyzed for MPO, TnT, creatine kinase MB, myoglobin, and high sensitive C-reactive protein. Fifty patients with angiographically proven but stable coronary artery disease (CAD) served as controls. In contrast to all other investigated markers, MPO was markedly elevated within 2 h of symptom onset in patients with AMI. Heparin, which is known to increase MPO plasma levels in patients with stable CAD, had no effect on MPO plasma levels in AMI patients. High levels of MPO plasma levels at the time of admission and the rapid peak of free plasma MPO levels after the onset of symptoms suggests that PMN activation is an early event in AMI and potentially precedes myocardial injury.",M1
19362083,"Intra-individual variability in troponin T concentration in dialysis patients.PURPOSE: Haemodialysis patients often have increased <e>TnT</e> concentrations in the absence of symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. To evaluate the potential usefulness of establishing patient specific baselines, we investigated intra-individual variability of TnT concentration in stable haemodialysis patients. METHODS: We measured pre-dialysis troponin T concentrations weekly for 15 weeks in 61 stable haemodialysis patients. RESULTS: Thirty two of 61 patients had at least one result greater than the diagnostic cut-off for significant myocardial damage of 0.04 microg/L. The intra-individual variability was small; 99% of all the variance from each patient's median was &lt; or = 0.063 microg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-individual variability in TnT concentration is small enough to merit establishment a of baseline concentration for each haemodialysis patient. This baseline is stable over at least 15 weeks; samples need be collected no more frequently than this. A change in concentration of more than 0.06 microg/L from the individual's baseline is significant.",M1
19357804,"Decision for aggressive therapy in acute pulmonary embolism: implication of elevated troponin T.BACKGROUND: Elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) has been described in the setting of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) earlier, though currently it has no implication on the therapy in this setting. The protocol established in our institution recommends the use of fibrinolytic therapy as first-line therapy in these patients only when cTnT is elevated. This analysis was performed to evaluate the safety of this regimen in regard to 30-day mortality, morbidity and complications. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 192 consecutive patients with confirmed PE, presenting at our institution during 2000-2005, were recruited. Right ventricular function was determined echocardiographically. CTnT was determined in all patients on admission. Patients without elevated cTnT were treated with anticoagulation alone, while patients with a <e>TnT</e> level above 0.1 ng/mL PE could be treated with thrombolysis on the discretion of the physician in charge. On day 30, cTnT elevation was associated with a higher mortality (P = 0.009). Moreover, in patients with intermediate-risk PE that were cTnT negative anticoagulation alone was safe showing a 30-day mortality of 1.8%, similar to low-risk PE (2.0%). In contrast to this patients with intermediate-risk PE with cTnT elevation showed a mortality rate of 20.8%, which was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with intermediate-risk PE without elevated cTnT, anticoagulation alone seems to be a safe regimen. The midterm prognosis of these patients is as good as the prognosis of patients with low-risk PE. In this cohort of patients with PE, beginning with a more conservative treatment strategy per se did not lead to an unfavourable outcome.",M1
19341744,"Structural basis for the activation of muscle contraction by troponin and tropomyosin.The molecular regulation of striated muscle contraction couples the binding and dissociation of Ca(2+) on troponin (Tn) to the movement of tropomyosin on actin filaments. In turn, this process exposes or blocks myosin binding sites on actin, thereby controlling myosin crossbridge dynamics and consequently muscle contraction. Using 3D electron microscopy, we recently provided structural evidence that a C-terminal extension of TnI is anchored on actin at low Ca(2+) and competes with tropomyosin for a common site to drive tropomyosin to the B-state location, a constrained, relaxing position on actin that inhibits myosin-crossbridge association. Here, we show that release of this constraint at high Ca(2+) allows a second segment of troponin, probably representing parts of <e>TnT</e> or the troponin core domain, to promote tropomyosin movement on actin to the Ca(2+)-induced C-state location. With tropomyosin stabilized in this position, myosin binding interactions can begin. Tropomyosin appears to oscillate to a higher degree between respective B- and C-state positions on troponin-free filaments than on fully regulated filaments, suggesting that tropomyosin positioning in both states is troponin-dependent. By biasing tropomyosin to either of these two positions, troponin appears to have two distinct structural functions; in relaxed muscles at low Ca(2+), troponin operates as an inhibitor, while in activated muscles at high Ca(2+), it acts as a promoter to initiate contraction.",M1
19326042,"Comparative transcriptional and biochemical studies in muscle of myotonic dystrophies (DM1 and DM2).Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (proximal muscular myopaty/DM2) are caused by similar dynamic mutations at two distinct genetic loci. The two diseases also lead to similar phenotypes but different clinical severity. Dysregulation of alternative splicing has been suggested as the common pathogenic mechanism. Here, we investigate the molecular differences between DM1 and DM2 using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and the insulin receptor (IR), as well as immunoblotting of TnT in muscle biopsies from DM1 and DM2 patients. We found that: (a) slow TnT was encoded by two different transcripts in significantly different ratios in DM1 and DM2 muscles; (b) DM2 muscles exhibited a higher degree of alternative splicing dysregulation for fast TnT transcripts when compared to DM1 muscles; (c) the distribution of TnT proteins was significantly skewed towards higher molecular weight species in both diseases; (d) the RNA for the insulin-independent IR-A isoform was significantly increased and appeared related to the fibre-type composition in the majority of the cases examined. On the whole, these data should give a better insight on pathogenesis of DM1 and DM2.",M1
19324313,"Cardiac fatigue in long-distance runners is associated with ventricular repolarization abnormalities.BACKGROUND: Prolonged exercise can induce cardiac fatigue, which is characterized by biomarker release and impaired myocardial function. The impact on ventricular electrophysiology is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine changes in ventricular repolarization after a 30-km cross-country race in runners aged &gt;or=55 years. METHODS: Fifteen healthy participants (62 +/- 5 years) were assessed using biomarkers (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], troponin T [<e>TnT</e>]), tissue Doppler echocardiography, and vectorcardiography at baseline, within 1 hour postrace and on days 1 and 6 postrace. RESULTS: During the race, NT-proBNP increased from 42 ng/L (interquartile range 25-117) to 187 ng/L (113-464), and TnT increased from undetectable levels to 0.03 microg/L (0.015-0.05). Global strain (19.1% +/- 2.2%) decreased on day 1 (17.2% +/- 1.8%) and day 6 (17.9% +/- 1.5%; P &lt;.01). QT(c) increased from 431 +/- 15 ms prerace to 445 +/- 22 ms postrace and 445 +/- 15 ms on day 1 (P &lt;.05), mainly because of an increased T(peak-end) interval (prerace 108 +/- 13 ms, postrace 127 +/- 43 ms, day 1 127 +/- 43 ms; P &lt;.05). Postrace, T(area) (baseline 75 +/- 26 microVs) peaked on day 1 (105 +/- 42 microVs) and remained high on day 6 (89 +/- 37 microVs; P &lt;.05). Runners with higher baseline NT-proBNP developed greater impairment of myocardial velocities (rho = -0.68 to -0.54; P &lt;.05) and a larger increase in T(area) (rho = 0.73; P &lt;.01). CONCLUSION: Cardiac fatigue induced by prolonged exertion is associated with sustained abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. Runners with higher baseline NT-proBNP are especially liable to such alterations of cardiac function.",M1
19275886,"Functional aberration of myofibrils by cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the coiled-coil region of the troponin-core domain.Two cardiomyopathy-causing mutations, E244D and K247R, in human cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) are located in the coiled-coil region of the Tn-core domain. To elucidate effects of mutations in this region on the regulatory function of Tn, we measured Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of myofibrils containing various mutants of TnT at these residues. The results confirmed that the mutant E244D increases the maximum ATPase activity without changing the Ca(2+)-sensitivity. The mutant K247R was shown for the first time to have the effect similar to the mutant E244D. Furthermore, various TnT mutants (E244D, E244M, E244A, E244K, K247R, K247E, and K247A) showed various effects on the maximum ATPase activity while the Ca(2+)-sensitivity was unchanged. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Tn-core containing these TnT mutants suggested that the hydrogen-bond network formed by the side chains of neighboring residues around residues 244 and 247 is important for Tn to function properly.",M1
19253165,"Newborn piglets exposed to hypoxia after nicotine or saline pretreatment: long-term effects on brain and heart.OBJECTIVE: We wished to assess the effect of global hypoxia and the effect of nicotine pretreatment on the brain and heart of newborn pigs. Hypothesising that nicotine might give a better outcome because of its anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: Twenty-two anaesthetised piglets were randomised to pretreatment with saline or nicotine (130 microg/kg/h) before 45 min global hypoxia. They were observed for 27 h. The brain and heart were assessed with histopathological methods. Serum for Troponin t (<e>TnT</e>) analyses was collected at baseline and at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups. At the end of hypoxia, BE was -14.8 +/- 4.9 mmol/l and MABP was 25 +/- 9 mmHg. Seven animals had autolysis of the cerebrum/cerebellum, their BE after hypoxia was -19 +/- 1.8 mmol/l and MABP 23 +/- 3 mmHg. The remaining 15 animals had a BE of -13 +/- 4.7mmol/l (p = 0.0004) and a MABP of 26 +/- 11 mmHg (ns). Eleven animals presented myocardial damage. A significant increase in TnT occurred in both groups. TnT increase and myocardial damage correlated (p = 0.001; r = 0.67). Animals with severe increase in TnT presented severe brain damage. CONCLUSIONS: Severe increase in serum TnT levels was linked to severe cerebral damage. Nicotine pretreatment had no impact on cerebral or cardiac histopathology.",M1
19233194,"The role of Akt/GSK-3beta signaling in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Mutations in cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) are a cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Transgenic mice expressing a missense mutation (R92Q) or a splice site donor mutation (Trunc) in the cardiac TnT gene have mutation-specific phenotypes but mice of both models have smaller hearts compared to wild type and exhibit hemodynamic dysfunction. Because growth-related signaling pathways in the hearts of mice expressing TnT mutations are not known, we evaluated the impact of increased Akt or glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activity in both mutant TnT mice; molecules that increase heart size via physiologic pathways and block pathologic growth, respectively. Expression of activated Akt dramatically augments heart size in both R92Q and Trunc mice; however, this increase in heart size is not beneficial, since Akt also increases fibrosis in both TnT mutants and causes some pathologic gene expression shifts in the R92Q mice. Activated GSK-3beta results in further decreases in left ventricular size in both R92Q and Trunc hearts, but this decrease is associated with significant mutation-specific phenotypes. Among many pathologic consequences, activating GSK-3beta in R92Q hearts decreases phosphorylation of troponin I and results in early mortality. In contrast, increased GSK-3beta activity in Trunc hearts does not significantly impact cardiac phenotypes. These findings demonstrate that increased Akt and its downstream target, GSK-3beta can impact both cardiac size and phenotype in a mutation-specific manner. Moreover, increased activity of these molecules implicated in beneficial cardiac phenotypes exacerbates the progression of disease in the R92Q TnT mutant.",M1
19218519,"Skeletal muscle fiber types in the ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata: implications for running performance.Ghost crabs possess rapid running capabilities, which make them good candidates for comparing invertebrate exercise physiology with that of more extensively studied vertebrates. While a number of studies have examined various aspects of running physiology and biomechanics in terrestrial crabs, none to date have defined the basic skeletal muscle fiber types that power locomotion. In the current study, we investigated skeletal muscle fiber types comprising the extensor and flexor carpopodite muscles in relation to running performance in the ghost crab. We used kinematic analyses to determine stride frequency and muscle shortening velocity and found that both parameters are similar to those of comparably sized mammals but slower than those observed in running lizards. Using several complementary methods, we found that the muscles are divided into two primary fiber types: those of the proximal and distal regions possess long sarcomeres (6.2+/-2.3 microm) observed in crustacean slow fibers and have characteristics of aerobic fibers whereas those of the muscle mid-region have short sarcomeres (3.5+/-0.4 microm) characteristic of fast fibers and appear to be glycolytic. Each fiber type is characterized by several different myofibrillar protein isoforms including multiple isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MHC), troponin I (TnI), troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and a crustacean fast muscle protein, P75. Three different isoforms of MHC are differentially expressed in the muscles, with fibers of the mid-region always co-expressing two isoforms at a 1:1 ratio within single fibers. Based on our analyses, we propose that these muscles are functionally divided into a two-geared system, with the aerobic fibers used for slow sustained activities and the glycolytic mid-region fibers being reserved for explosive sprints. Finally, we identified subtle differences in myofibrillar isoform expression correlated with crab body size, which changes by several orders of magnitude during an animal's lifetime.",M1
19214300,"Prognostic implications of C-reactive protein and troponin following percutaneous coronary intervention.BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, plays a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic events. The relationship between CRP levels and myocardial necrosis assessed by troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been established. In addition, the long-term significance of TnT rise following PCI is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between CRP and the rise in TnT levels, and evaluate the long-term prognostic implications of TnT rise following PCI. METHODS: A total of 1208 patients underwent successful nonemergent PCI. Baseline demographic characteristics, CRP and TnT levels were prospectively collected before and 12 h to 18 h following PCI. Long-term follow-up data over two years were available. RESULTS: Among the patients studied (mean age 62 years), 64% presented with acute coronary syndrome. A PCI procedure was associated with a significant increase in TnT levels (higher than 0.1 microg/L) in 238 patients (20%). Multivariate logistic regression identified presentation with acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction, no statin use at the time of the procedure, increased CRP and increasing length of stent as independent predictors of TnT rise following PCI. Periprocedural TnT rise was not associated with adverse events in follow-up examinations (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial necrosis commonly occurred in otherwise successful PCI and was particularly prevalent in the proinflammatory milieu of a recent myocardial infarction. This response was blunted with statin therapy. However, there was no long-term adverse sequelae of these troponin rises following otherwise uncomplicated PCI.",M1
19189074,"Decreased contractility due to energy deprivation in a transgenic rat model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and sudden death. Recently, it has been suggested that inefficient energy utilization could be a common molecular pathway of HCM-related mutations. We have previously generated transgenic Sprague-Dawley rats overexpressing a truncated cardiac troponin T (DEL-<e>TNT</e>) molecule, displaying typical features of HCM such as diastolic dysfunction and an increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. We now studied these rats using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). MRS demonstrated that cardiac energy metabolism was markedly impaired, as indicated by a decreased phosphocreatine to ATP ratio (-31%, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, we assessed contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes. While DEL-TNT and control cardiomyocytes showed no difference under baseline conditions, DEL-TNT cardiomyocytes selectively exhibited a decrease in fractional shortening by 28% after 1 h in glucose-deprived medium (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, significant decreases in contraction velocity and relaxation velocity were observed. To identify the underlying molecular pathways, we performed transcriptional profiling using real-time PCR. DEL-TNT hearts exhibited induction of several genes critical for cardiac energy supply, including CD36, CPT-1/-2, and PGC-1alpha. Finally, DEL-TNT rats and controls were studied by radiotelemetry after being stressed by isoproterenol, revealing a significantly increased frequency of arrhythmias in transgenic animals. In summary, we demonstrate profound energetic alterations in DEL-TNT hearts, supporting the notion that inefficient cellular ATP utilization contributes to the pathogenesis of HCM.",M1
19131135,"Incidence and determinants of myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary interventions according to the revised Joint Task Force definition of troponin T elevation.BACKGROUND: Elevations in troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) occur frequently following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and are associated with an adverse prognosis. The Joint ESC/ACC/AHA/WHF Task Force have released a proposal for a universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), including diagnostic criteria for PCI associated MI. This is based on a TnT cut-point of more than three times the 99th percentile (0.03 ng/ml), which better reflects the precision of the assay. Our study investigated the incidence and predictive factors of a PCI associated MI, using the revised definition. METHODS: 325 patients were studied following PCI with stenting. TnT was collected at both 8 and 18 h following PCI in patients with either stable or unstable angina and normal baseline TnT levels. Comparison was made of both clinical and procedural characteristics of patients with and without a rise in TnT following intervention, using cut points of 0.01 and 0.03 ng/ml. RESULTS: TnT was elevated &gt; or = 0.03 ng/ml in 27% and &gt; or = 0.01 ng/ml in 39% of patients following PCI. Troponin elevation was significantly more likely in those patients who experienced peri-procedural ischemic symptoms or EKG changes, or in whom abciximab was used. The variables associated with a troponin rise showed a greater difference between TnT positive and negative patients when using 0.03 ng/ml compared to 0.01 ng/ml, suggesting that this may be a better definition of PCI-related MI. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-quarter of low risk patients experience a procedural MI according to the revised definition. Rises in troponin were significantly associated with peri-procedural ischemic symptoms and EKG changes, and abciximab use, consistent with this level of TnT reflecting true myocardial necrosis.",M1
19108919,"Variations in population-based levels of C-reactive protein, cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality: an analysis of the relationship between C-reactive protein, Troponin-T, cardiovascular morbidity and death rates in an unselected population in Southwest Norway.BACKGROUND: Large population-based studies link inflammation to the prospective development of cardiovascular events. We investigated the time-dependent associations between variations in infectious disease as reflected by alterations of C-reactive protein (CRP)-levels in the general population and the number of cardiovascular events and death rates. METHODS: Retrospectively, we studied CRP- and Troponin T (<e>TNT</e>) values drawn for any clinical reason, the number of cardiovascular events and the death rates in the population of Southern Rogaland, Norway over a 2 year period. RESULTS: The mean and the sum of CRP values per week were significantly correlated with the number of patients with a TNT&gt; or =0.03 microg/l in the same week (R=0.42, R=0.43, respectively, p&lt;0.001 for both analysis). Further, we found a significant correlation between the mean and the sum of CRP values per week and the number of patients admitted with a cardiovascular event 2 weeks later (R=0.20, R=0.26; p=0.047, p=0.009, respectively). The sum of CRP values per week was significantly correlated to the death rates in the following week (R=0.30, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support the hypothesis that inflammation assessed by CRP levels is linked to the prospective development of cardiovascular events and all cause mortality.",M1
19033655,"Cardiac troponin T mutations promote life-threatening arrhythmias.Mutations in contractile proteins in heart muscle can cause anatomical changes that result in cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, a conundrum has existed because mutations in one such contractile protein, a so-called Ca2+ sensor troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), can promote ventricular rhythm disturbances even in the absence of hypertrophy or fibrosis. Thus, these mutations must enhance abnormal electrophysiological events via alternative means. In this issue of the JCI, Baudenbacher et al. report a novel mechanism to explain this puzzle (see the related article beginning on page 3893). They show that a selected TnT mutation in the adult mouse heart can markedly increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle myofilaments to Ca2+ and enhance the susceptibility to arrhythmia, even in the absence of anatomical deformities. As these same mutations can cause some forms of arrhythmias in humans, these findings are of both basic and translational significance.",M1
19032759,"B-type natriuretic peptide is a long-term predictor of all-cause mortality, whereas high-sensitive C-reactive protein predicts recurrent short-term troponin T positive cardiac events in chest pain patients: a prognostic study.BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed whether the combined use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) improves risk stratification for mortality and cardiovascular events in a population with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Therefore, we wanted to assess the incremental prognostic value of these biomarkers with respect to long-term all-cause mortality and recurrent troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) positive cardiac events in 871 patients admitted to the emergency department. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained immediately following admission. RESULTS: After a follow-up period of 24 months, 129 patients had died. The BNP levels were significantly higher among patients dying than in long-term survivors (401 (145-736) versus 75 (29-235) pq/mL [median, 25 and 75% percentiles], p = 0.000). In a multivariable Cox regression model for death within 2 years, the hazard ratio (HR) for BNP in the highest quartile (Q4) was 5.13 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.97-13.38) compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) and was associated with all-cause mortality above and beyond age, congestive heart failure and the index diagnosis ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. HsCRP rendered no prognostic information for all-cause mortality. However, within 30 days, the adjusted HR for patients with recurrent TnT cardiac positive events hsCRP in Q4 was 14.79 (95% CI, 1.89-115.63) compared with Q1 and was associated with recurrent ischemic events above and beyond age, hypercholesterolemia and TnT values at admission. CONCLUSION: BNP may act as a clinically useful biomarker when obtained at admission in an unselected patient population following hospitalization with chest pain and potential ACS, and may provide complementary prognostic information to established risk determinants at long-term follow-up. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the additional assessment of hsCRP will lead to better risk stratification for survival than BNP alone.",M1
19011203,"Weight and nutrition affect pre-mRNA splicing of a muscle gene associated with performance, energetics and life history.A fundamental feature of gene expression in multicellular organisms is the production of distinct transcripts from single genes by alternative splicing (AS), which amplifies protein and functional diversity. In spite of the likely consequences for organismal biology, little is known about how AS varies among individuals or responds to body condition, environmental variation or extracellular signals in general. Here we show that evolutionarily conserved AS of troponin-t in flight muscle of adult moths responds in a quantitative fashion to experimental manipulation of larval nutrition and adult body weight. Troponin-t (<e>Tnt</e>) isoform composition is known to affect muscle force and power output in other animals, and is shown here to be associated with the thorax mass-specific rate of energy consumption during flight. Loading of adults with external weights for 5 days caused an AS response nearly identical to equal increases in actual body weight. In addition, there were effects of larval feeding history on adult Tnt isoform composition that were independent of body weight, with moths from poorer larval feeding regimes producing isoform profiles associated with reduced muscle performance and energy consumption rate. Thus, Tnt isoform composition in striated muscle is responsive to both weight-sensing and nutrition-sensing mechanisms, with consequent effects on function. In free-living butterflies, Tnt isoform composition was also associated with activity level and very strongly with the rate of egg production. Overall, these results show that AS of a muscle gene responds in a quantitative fashion to whole-organism variables, which apparently serves to coordinate muscle strength and energy expenditure with body condition and life history.",M1
18986304,"Phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I by mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1.Mst1 (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase and its activation in the heart causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Its myocardial substrates, however, remain unknown. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library with a dominant-negative Mst1 (K59R) mutant used as bait, cTn [cardiac Tn (troponin)] I was identified as an Mst1-interacting protein. The interaction of cTnI with Mst1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in both co-transfected HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) and native cardiomyocytes, in which cTnI interacted with full-length Mst1, but not with its N-terminal kinase fragment. in vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that cTnI is a sensitive substrate for Mst1. In contrast, cTnT was phosphorylated by Mst1 only when it was incorporated into the Tn complex. MS analysis indicated that Mst1 phosphorylates cTnI at Thr(31), Thr(51), Thr(129) and Thr(143). Substitution of Thr(31) with an alanine residue reduced Mst1-mediated cTnI phosphorylation by 90%, whereas replacement of Thr(51), Thr(129) or Thr(143) with alanine residues reduced Mst1-catalysed cTnI phosphorylation by approx. 60%, suggesting that Thr(31) is a preferential phosphorylation site for Mst1. Furthermore, treatment of cardiomyocytes with hydrogen peroxide rapidly induced Mst1-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI at Thr(31). Protein epitope analysis and binding assays showed that Mst1-mediated phosphorylation modulates the molecular conformation of cTnI and its binding affinity to <e>TnT</e> and TnC, thus indicating functional significances. The results of the present study suggest that Mst1 is a novel mediator of cTnI phosphorylation in the heart and may contribute to the modulation of myofilament function under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",M1
18951215,"Prenatal buprenorphine exposure: effects on biochemical markers of hypoxia and early neonatal outcome.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible association between prenatal buprenorphine exposure and compromised early neonatal outcome in view of markers of perinatal hypoxia. DESIGN, SETTING AND SAMPLE: The study group consisted of 27 full-term neonates exposed to buprenorphine prenatally and prospectively followed up at a special tertiary outpatient clinic for pregnant drug abusers. Serving as controls were 27 full-term neonates exposed prenatally to illicit substances other than opioids and 38 full-term neonates from uncomplicated pregnancies of healthy parturients. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Apgar scores, cord pH and base excess were recorded. Cord serum samples were collected at birth for analysis of biochemical markers of fetal hypoxic stress: erythropoietin (EPO; chronic hypoxia), cardiac troponin T (cardiac involvement) and S100 (neural damage). RESULTS: All infants were born in good condition according to Apgar scores and pH of cord blood. No statistically significant differences were found between the three groups in cord serum concentrations of EPO (33.0 median, range: 9.0-476.0 U/L in the buprenorphine-exposed group vs 27.0, range: 8.0-114.0 U/L in substance-abusing controls vs 28.1, range: 11.6-260.0 U/L in healthy controls) or S100 (0.47, range: 0.25-0.91 microg/L vs 0.40, range: 0.12-1.22 microg/L vs 0.47, range: 0.20-2.15 microg/L). No significant differences existed in cardiac <e>TnT</e> levels (0.017, range: 0.010-0.072 U/L vs 0.010, range: 0.010-0.075 U/L vs 0.024, range: 0.010-0.075 U/L). CONCLUSIONS: While no significant differences in asphyxia markers were observed between the three groups, a tendency towards higher levels of EPO emerged in the buprenorphine-exposed group.",M1
18948673,"Suppression of cardiac troponin T induces reduction of contractility and structural disorganization in chicken cardiomyocytes.We herein examine the effect of cardiac troponin T (CTnT) suppression in cultured chicken cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic cardiac ventricular muscle. <e>TnT</e> is an important protein participating in regulation of striated muscle contraction, but it is not clear whether TnT contributes to the formation of sarcomere structure in myofibrils. Double-stranded RNA homologous to the nucleotide sequence of CTnT (CTnT-siRNA) was introduced into cultured muscle cells two days after plating. Transfection efficiency was above 80%. Immunoblot analyses suggested that the expression of CTnT progressively falls for the three consecutive days after transfection, but partly reappears on the fourth day. Maximum suppression occurs three days after transfection, with almost invisible CTnT protein on immunoblots in all the examined conditions: 0.5-2 nmol CTnT-siRNA towards 1-3 x 10(6) cells. The suppression was specific to CTnT, and the other myofibrillar proteins such as myosin, connectin/titin, tropomyosin, alpha-actinin, and troponin I were all present in transfected cells. The following functional and morphological changes were detected in CTnT-suppressed cells. The population of beating cells decreased significantly after transfection, when compared to control cells. A part of CTnT-suppressed cells showed two non-overlapping types of morphological changes: 1) myofibrils presenting unusually long Z-Z intervals; 2) myofibrils with irregular small striations in cells not connected at their adhesion interfaces of a jagged-appearance. Thus, our results reveal that CTnT is important for stable beating in cultured ventricular muscle cells, and also to some extent, for maintaining myofibrillar structure and cell-to-cell adhesion.",M1
18942493,"Influence of a half-marathon run on NT-proBNP and troponin T.BACKGROUND: A caveat to strenuous and medium term physical exercise is the potential cardiovascular damage it may cause. In particular, there is still controversy regarding the behaviour of biochemical markers of heart damage and dysfunction following medium term endurance training. METHODS: Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and the N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were assessed before a 21-km half-marathon, at the end, and 3, 6, 24 h thereafter on 17 trained, middle-aged males. Results were corrected for plasma volume changes. RESULTS: All athletes finished the half-marathon run successfully and without any symptoms. Most of them were able to fulfill their personal expectations. The % PVC increased significantly immediately after the run, returned to values not significantly different from the baseline at 3 and 6 h, and showed a significant decrease of 4.4% on the following day. None of the cases showed an increase in the concentration of TnT the &gt; 0.03 ng/ml threshold. Although the level of NT-proBNP increased significantly at the end of the run and remained statistically higher than the pre-half marathon value for the following 24 h, no athlete displayed values exceeding the cut-off concentration of 125 pg/mL. At any time point the delta increments of NT-proBNP from the pre-run values did not significantly correlate with the corresponding % PVC. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results in healthy, middle-aged, trained individuals are consistent with the hypothesis that medium term aerobic exercise significantly influences NT-proBNP values for up to 24 h though no biochemical signs of myocardial necrosis can be detected.",M1
18722546,"Cloning and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding troponin T from tick Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (Acari: Ixodidae).Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) is a key protein for Ca(2+)-sensitive molecular switching of muscle contraction. The entire cDNA sequence of Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis troponin T gene (HqTnT) from the hard tick was cloned here. The cDNA sequence of HqTnT possesses an ORF of 1170 bp coding for a mature protein with 389 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 46.5 kDa. Search of the cloned sequence in GenBank revealed that HqTnT gene shared some homology with TnT genes of other organisms. By sequence comparison, two conserved domains were identified in the middle (residues 54-78) and close to the carboxyl-terminal end (residues 181-229) of the amino acid sequence of HqTnT. These conserved domains might be responsible for the interaction with tick tropomyosin and troponin I subunit, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed a ubiquitous expression of HqTnT gene at different developmental stages and in different tissues of the tick. The HqTnT was expressed as glutathione S-transferase fused protein in a prokaryotic system. Though rHqTnT could induce specific antibodies in sheep, the antibodies could not protect sheep from the infestation of ticks. Therefore, recombinantly produced HqTnT could not be a candidate antigen for developing anti-tick vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tick TnT gene.",M1
18672166,"Minimally elevated cardiac troponin T and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide predict mortality in older adults: results from the Rancho Bernardo Study.OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the prognostic value of detectable cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in a population of community-dwelling older adults. BACKGROUND: Minimally elevated levels of TnT, a marker of cardiomyocyte injury, have been found in small subsets of the general population, with uncertain implications. A marker of ventricular stretch, NT-proBNP has clinical utility in many venues, but its long-term prognostic value in apparently healthy older adults and in conjunction with TnT is unknown. METHODS: Participants were 957 older adults from the Rancho Bernardo Study with plasma NT-proBNP and TnT measured at baseline (1997 to 1999) and followed up for mortality through July 2006. RESULTS: Participants with detectable TnT (&gt;/=0.01 ng/ml, n = 39) had an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] by Cox proportional hazards analysis: 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 to 3.28, p = 0.003 for all-cause mortality; HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.12, p = 0.040 for cardiovascular mortality); elevated NT-proBNP also predicted an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR per unit-log increase in NT-proBNP: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.52, p &lt; 0.001 for all-cause mortality; HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.55 to 4.08, p &lt; 0.001 for cardiovascular mortality). Those with both elevated NT-proBNP and detectable TnT had poorer survival (HR for high NT-proBNP and detectable TnT vs. low NT-proBNP and any TnT: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.91 to 5.38, p &lt; 0.001). Exclusion of the 152 participants with heart disease at baseline did not materially change the TnT mortality or NT-proBNP mortality associations. CONCLUSIONS: Apparently healthy adults with detectable TnT or elevated NT-proBNP levels are at increased risk of death. Those with both TnT and NT-proBNP elevations are at even higher risk, and the increased risk persists for years.",M1
18605943,"Diagnostic, clinical and laboratory turnaround times in troponin T testing.BACKGROUND: At present, measurements of troponins play a key role in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. There is a consensus that a turnaround time (TAT) of 1 h or less should be achieved for cardiac marker assays. However, little is known about the real delays between the patient's arrival at the emergency department (ED) and the reporting of the test. METHODS: In the present study, the TATs of a cardiac marker, troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), were analyzed at a central laboratory at Kuopio University Hospital in a population consisting of 215 patients who were admitted to the hospital ED. Four specific time points were recorded: 1) the time of the patient's arrival to the ED, 2) the time of the ordering of the test, 3) the time when blood samples arrived at the laboratory, and 4) the time of completion and reporting of the test. RESULTS: The median diagnostic TAT from patient's arrival to the reporting of the TnT result was 122 min. The clinical median TAT was 46 min and the laboratory median TAT was 69 min. Laboratory TAT consisted of the preanalytical TAT at the ED (median 14 min), pre- and postanalytical TAT in the laboratory (median 40 min), and the analytical TAT (on average 10 min). The laboratory TAT was approximately half of the complete diagnostic TAT. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this analysis, we propose new concepts for the TATs in the diagnostic process: diagnostic TAT which consists of clinical and laboratory TAT. The focus should be shifted from the analytical TAT to the diagnostic process as a whole.",M1
18603621,"Association between C-reactive protein and generalized anxiety disorder in stable coronary heart disease patients.AIMS: Comprehensive evaluation of major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, and MDD in conjunction with anxiety disorder in stable coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, including cardiac biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), and amino-terminal pro-B-type brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study of a consecutive series of 120 stable CHD outpatients (n = 30 with MDD, n = 30 with anxiety disorder, n = 30 with MDD and anxiety disorder, n = 30 with no psychiatric disorder). Psychiatric diagnoses were established by using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV). Binomial logistic regression analyses using cut-off scores of biomarkers as dependent variables showed associations between CRP and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (P = 0.04), and education (P = 0.004), whereas MDD, and MDD and anxiety disorder did not reach the significance level. TnT showed relationships with hyperlipidaemia (P = 0.009), history of obesity or overweight (P = 0.04), and education (P = 0.04). NT-proBNP was associated with type II diabetes (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for relevant demographic, medical, and psychiatric co-variables, CRP was associated with GAD.",M1
18590640,"[Troponin-T monitoring in outpatients with nonischemic heart failure]INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The usefulness of prolonged troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>) monitoring in outpatients with nonischemic heart failure (HF) is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, prognostic value and determinants of a raised TnT level. METHODS: The study involved 80 outpatients (age 56+/-14 years, 69% male) with chronic stable HF (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 24+/-9%; 51 in New York Heart Association class II and 29 in class III) of non-ischemic origin, as confirmed with coronary angiography. The TnT level was measured at study entry and at every outpatient visit (median interval, 3.1 months; interquartile range [IQR], 1.8-5.0 months) in a follow-up period of 22.2+/-10.6 months. Patients were TnT+ if the level was measurable (i.e., &gt;0.01 ng/mL). RESULTS: At study entry, 7 (9%) patients were TnT+. By 5 years, the cumulative incidence had reached 53%, and the median TnT level was 0.059 ng/mL (IQR, 0.023-0.100 ng/mL; range, 0.013-0.500 ng/mL). Beta-blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in incidence (hazard ratio [HR]=0.220; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.089-0.540; P=.001) while the incidence increased with the N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level (HR=1.005; 95% CI, 1.001-1.010; P=0.021). During follow-up, 14 (17.5%) patients had a cardiac event (i.e., 9 cardiac deaths and 5 urgent transplants); these occurred in 12 (50%) of the 24 TnT+ patients vs. 2 (3.6%) of the 56 TnT- patients (P&lt; .001). After adjustment, Cox multivariate analysis showed that being TnT+ was a predictor of an adverse event (HR per 0.01 ng/mL=1.359; 95% CI, 1.037-1.782; P=.026), independently of the NT-proBNP level (HR per 500 pg/mL=1.057; 95% CI, 1.023-1.092; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: A measurable TnT level was frequently observed during clinical monitoring of outpatients with non-ischemic HF and indicated a poor prognosis, even when the level was low.",M1
18579801,"Adaptation by alternative RNA splicing of slow troponin T isoforms in type 1 but not type 2 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.Slow troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) plays an indispensable role in skeletal muscle function. Alternative RNA splicing in the NH(2)-terminal region produces high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) isoforms of slow TnT. Normal adult slow muscle fibers express mainly HMW slow TnT. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of inherited peripheral polyneuropathies caused by various neuronal defects. We found in the present study that LMW slow TnT was significantly upregulated in demyelination form type 1 CMT (CMT1) but not axonal form type 2 CMT (CMT2) muscles. Contractility analysis showed an increased specific force in single fibers isolated from CMT1 but not CMT2 muscles compared with control muscles. However, an in vitro motility assay showed normal velocity of the myosin motor isolated from CMT1 and CMT2 muscle biopsies, consistent with their unchanged myosin isoform contents. Supporting a role of slow TnT isoform regulation in contractility change, LMW and HMW slow TnT isoforms showed differences in the molecular conformation in conserved central and COOH-terminal regions with changed binding affinity for troponin I and tropomyosin. In addition to providing a biochemical marker for the differential diagnosis of CMT, the upregulation of LMW slow TnT isoforms under the distinct pathophysiology of CMT1 demonstrates an adaptation of muscle function to neurological disorders by alternative splicing modification of myofilament proteins.",M1
18556368,"Restricted N-terminal truncation of cardiac troponin T: a novel mechanism for functional adaptation to energetic crisis.The N-terminal variable region of cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) is a regulatory structure that can be selectively removed during myocardial ischaemia reperfusion by mu-calpain proteolysis. Here we investigated the pathophysiological significance of this post-translational modification that removes amino acids 1-71 of cardiac TnT. Working heart preparations were employed to study rat acute myocardial infarction and transgenic mouse hearts over-expressing the N-terminal truncated cardiac TnT (cTnT-ND). Ex vivo myocardial infarction by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery induced heart failure and produced cTnT-ND not only in the infarct but also in remote zones, including the right ventricular free wall, indicating a whole organ response in the absence of systemic neurohumoral mechanisms. Left ventricular pressure overload in mouse working hearts produced increased cTnT-ND in both ventricles, suggesting a role of haemodynamic stress in triggering an acute whole organ proteolytic regulation. Transgenic mouse hearts in which the endogenous intact cardiac TnT was partially replaced by cTnT-ND showed lowered contractile velocity. When afterload increased from 55 mmHg to 90 mmHg, stroke volume decreased in the wild type but not in the transgenic mouse hearts. Correspondingly, the left ventricular rapid-ejection time of the transgenic mouse hearts was significantly longer than that of wild type hearts, especially at high afterload. The restricted deletion of the N-terminal variable region of cardiac troponin T demonstrates a novel mechanism by which the thin filament regulation adapts to sustain cardiac function under stress conditions.",M1
18548613,"Expression of the fast twitch troponin complex, fTnT, fTnI and fTnC, in vascular smooth muscle.It is generally believed that proteins of the troponin complex are not expressed in smooth muscle. We have directly assayed for expression of troponin transcripts in mouse vascular smooth muscle and found that troponin sequences normally associated with fast twitch skeletal muscle (fTnT, fTnI, fTnC) were present at significant levels in the thoracic aorta. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that fTnT, fTnI and fTnC transcripts were expressed in the smooth muscle layer of mouse blood vessels of all sizes. Protein blot analysis using rat tissue showed that at least two members of the troponin complex, Troponin T and Troponin I, were translated in vascular smooth muscle of the aorta. Finally, immuno-fluorescence microscopy of rat aortic smooth muscle revealed that <e>TnT</e> and TnI are localized in a unique pattern, coincident with the distribution of tropomyosin. It seems likely therefore, that a complete troponin complex is expressed in vascular smooth muscle and is associated with the contractile machinery of the cell. These observations raise the possibility that troponins play a role in regulation of smooth muscle function.",M1
18483193,"Structural basis for tropomyosin overlap in thin (actin) filaments and the generation of a molecular swivel by troponin-T.Head-to-tail polymerization of tropomyosin is crucial for its actin binding, function in actin filament assembly, and the regulation of actin-myosin contraction. Here, we describe the 2.1 A resolution structure of crystals containing overlapping tropomyosin N and C termini (TM-N and TM-C) and the 2.9 A resolution structure of crystals containing TM-N and TM-C together with a fragment of troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>). At each junction, the N-terminal helices of TM-N were splayed, with only one of them packing against TM-C. In the C-terminal region of TM-C, a crucial water in the coiled-coil core broke the local 2-fold symmetry and helps generate a kink on one helix. In the presence of a TnT fragment, the asymmetry in TM-C facilitates formation of a 4-helix bundle containing two TM-C chains and one chain each of TM-N and TnT. Mutating the residues that generate the asymmetry in TM-C caused a marked decrease in the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin filaments. The highly conserved region of TnT, in which most cardiomyopathy mutations reside, is crucial for interacting with tropomyosin. The structure of the ternary complex also explains why the skeletal- and cardiac-muscle specific C-terminal region is required to bind TnT and why tropomyosin homodimers bind only a single TnT. On actin filaments, the head-to-tail junction can function as a molecular swivel to accommodate irregularities in the coiled-coil path between successive tropomyosins enabling each to interact equivalently with the actin helix.",M1
18469358,"Ischemia modified albumin, a marker of acute ischemic events: a pilot study.Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) is a relatively new marker for evaluating patients with cardiac ischemia. Data are emerging on its potential role in non-cardiac ischemic events. In this pilot study we evaluated the utility of IMA in diagnosing acute coronary syndromes (ACS), assessed its role in the diagnosis of non-cardiac ischemia, and correlated its efficacy with troponin T (<e>TnT</e>). Serum levels of IMA were measured in 89 sequential patients who presented to the emergency room with chest pain for which serum TnT was ordered. The patients were classified into 4 groups based on their IMA and TnT results and discharge diagnoses. The data were analyzed with Fischer's exact test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis relating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to the combination of TnT and IMA was also performed. The results showed that IMA was a useful marker for the diagnosis of ACS. There was a significant relationship between TnT and IMA (p = 0.032), suggesting that both these biomarkers added significant information about the presence of ACS (p = 0.028) and may be useful for triage of patients who present to the emergency room with chest pain. Serum IMA was also increased in a small proportion of patients with symptoms of stroke, suggesting that it should be considered a marker of acute ischemic events and not specific for cardiac ischemia.",M1
18462828,"Cardiac blood biomarkers in patients receiving thoracic (chemo)radiation.Cardiotoxicity is a known consequence of thoracic irradiation and there are multiple overlapping risk factors for cardiac disease and thoracic malignancies. In this study, we quantified the impact of thoracic (chemo)radiation on cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Thirty patients receiving radiation therapy to the thorax with or without concurrent chemotherapy were evaluated. Serum was collected at baseline, 2 weeks into treatment and at the completion of radiation therapy. TnT, CK-MB and NT-proBNP were quantified using commercially available immunoassays. Cardiac dosimetric parameters and clinical risk factors were examined. In 29 of 30 patients, serum TnT remained undetectable (&lt;0.01ng/mL) throughout (chemo)radiation. In the one patient with detectable serum TnT, levels did not change significantly with treatment. Similarly, thoracic (chemo)radiation did not cause statistically significant elevations in serum CK-MB and NT-proBNP. Thus, contemporary thoracic (chemo)radiation does not commonly result in elevations of serum TnT, CK-MB or NT-proBNP. Elevations in these markers during treatment merit further evaluation.",M1
18362427,"Elevated levels of both cardiomyocyte membrane and myofibril damage markers predict adverse outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown the presence of ongoing myocardial damage in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) detected by myofibril and membrane damage markers, cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), which identifies patients at increased risk of a future cardiac event (CE: death or rehospitalization because of worsening CHF). There is a difference between TnT and H-FABP in their release kinetics following myocardial damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: TnT and H-FABP were measured in 103 patients with CHF and in 31 controls. Patients were classified into 4 groups based on detectable (&gt;or=0.01 ng/ml) or undetectable TnT (TnT+ or TnT-) and H-FABP &gt;or= or &lt;4.5 ng/ml (mean + 2 standard deviations in controls) (high-H-FABP or low-H-FABP). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the CE-free rate (n=43) was significantly lower in patients with TnT+ and high-H-FABP than in patients in the other 3 groups (patients with TnT+ and low-H-FABP, TnT- and high-H-FABP, and TnT- and low-H-FABP; p=0.02, p=0.001 and p=0.0002, respectively). In stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, TnT+ (p=0.01) and high-H-FABP (p=0.04) were independent predictors of future CE. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of both TnT and H-FABP predict adverse outcomes in CHF patients.",M1
18355657,"N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide assessment provides incremental prognostic information in patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal troponin T values upon admission.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in two independent samples of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and normal troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) values. BACKGROUND: Recently assessment of NT-proBNP has been studied in patients with ACS. However, the clinical relevance in patients who present without troponin elevation is unclear. METHODS: We included 2,614 patients from two independent registries, one serving as a derivation cohort comprising patients with evident ACS (Bad Nauheim ACS registry, n = 1,131) and the other serving as a validation cohort including chest pain patients (PACS [Prognosis in Acute Coronary Syndromes] registry, n = 1,483). NT-proBNP and TnT were measured upon admission. Clinical outcome has been assessed over a 6-month period. RESULTS: In both cohorts, the mortality rate was significantly lower among TnT negative patients: 3.8% versus 8.2% (p = 0.009) in the Bad Nauheim ACS registry, and 2.8% versus 8.6% (p = 0.009) in the PACS registry. Among TnT negative patients, receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis yielded an optimal cutoff value of 474 pg/ml for NT-proBNP that was able to discriminate patients at higher risk in the Bad Nauheim ACS and PACS registries (mortality rate 12.3% vs. 1.3%, p &lt; 0.001 and 8.5% vs. 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with NT-proBNP values over 474 pg/ml were at higher risk for death in the Bad Nauheim ACS registry (log-rank 19.01, p &lt; 0.001, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 9.56 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42 to 37.7], p = 0.001) and in the PACS registry (log-rank 23.16, p &lt; 0.001, adjusted HR 5.02 [95% CI 2.04 to 12.33], p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected ACS considered to be at low risk because of normal troponin values, NT-proBNP above 474 pg/ml is able to discriminate individuals at higher risk. Because of its incremental prognostic value, NT-proBNP assessment should be considered in clinical routine for risk stratification of patients with normal troponin.",M1
18270676,"[Continuous beta-block with esmolol in combination with enoximone: influence on cardiac function in high risk patients undergoing vascular surgery]BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess cardiac function in vascular surgery patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who received continuous perioperative beta blocker therapy with esmolol alone versus esmolol in combination with the phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitor enoximone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 24 h, 28 patients were assigned to receive heart rate (HR) control by continuous infusion of esmolol in combination with the PDE III inhibitor enoximone (Esmolol+Enoximone group) or esmolol alone (Esmolol group; n=14). Cardiac function was assessed by the use of a pulmonary artery catheter and serial measurements of plasma troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) und B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). RESULTS: The heart rate significantly decreased to the target rate of 50-60 min(-1) in both groups over the observation period. Cardiac index increased significantly only in Esmolol+Enoximone-treated patients (from 2.4+/-0.2 lxmin(-1)xm(-2) to 3.1+/-0.1 lxmin(-1)xm(-2)) and was significantly higher than in the esmolol alone group (from 2.5+/-0.2 lxmin(-1)xm(-2) to 2.4+/-0.1 lxmin(-1)xm(-2)). No patient had detectable levels of cTnT perioperatively. Peak plasma BNP concentrations were significantly increased in both groups but the highest values were measured in the esmolol alone group. CONCLUSION: Inotropic therapy with the PDE III inhibitor enoximone improves cardiac function in high risk patients with known CAD undergoing vascular surgery and also when receiving systematic heart rate control by continuous infusion of esmolol.",M1
18208663,"Calpain I inhibition prevents atrial structural remodeling in a canine model with atrial fibrillation.BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is accompanied by atrial structural remodeling. Calpain activity is induced during AF. To test a causal relationship between calpain activation and atrial structural changes, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met (ALLM), a calpain inhibitor, was utilized in a canine AF model. METHODS: Fifteen dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, control group and calpain inhibitor group; each with 5 dogs. Sustained AF was induced by rapid right atrium pacing at 600 beats per minute for 3 weeks. ALLM was administered at a dosage of 1.0 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the calpain inhibitor group. Three weeks later, the proteolysis, protein expression of <e>TnT</e> and myosin, calpain I localization and expression and structural changes were examined in left atrial free walls, right atrial free walls and the interatrial septum respectively. Atrial size and contractile function were also measured by echocardiography. RESULTS: Long-term rapid atrial pacing induced marked structural changes such as enlarged atrial volume, myolysis, degradation of TnT and myosin, accumulation of glycogen and changes in mitochondrial shape and size, which were paralleled by an increase in calpain activity. The positive correlation between calpain activity and the degree of myolysis (r(s) = 0.90 961, P &lt; 0.0001) was demonstrated. In addition to structural abnormalities, pacing-induced atrial contractile dysfunction was observed in this study. The pacing-induced atrial structural alterations and loss of contractility were partially prevented by the calpain inhibitor ALLM. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of calpain represents key features in the progression towards overt structural remodeling. Calpain inhibitor, ALLM, suppressed the increased calpain activity and reversed structural remodeling caused by sustained atrial fibrillation in the present model. Calpain inhibition may therefore provide a possibility for therapeutic intervention in AF.",M1
18181677,"Influence of sampling time and ultrafiltration coefficient of the dialysis membrane on cardiac troponin I and T.CONTEXT: The measurement of cardiac troponin I (TnI) and T (<e>TnT</e>) is essential to diagnose, guide therapy, and predict outcomes of the acute coronary syndrome. Increased levels of troponins, especially TnT, are frequently observed in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD), reflecting ongoing and subclinical myocardial damage. OBJECTIVE: Because these markers are increasingly used for stratification of cardiac risk in these patients, their behavior during HD should be acknowledged to optimize their clinical usefulness. DESIGN: TnI and TnT were measured in 34 patients pre-HD and post-HD by either high- or low-flux membranes. The post-HD concentrations were corrected for hemoconcentration. RESULTS: Pre-HD levels above the 99th percentile reference limits of the general population of TnI (&gt;0.06 ng/ mL) and TnT (&gt;0.01 ng/mL) were observed in 9% (13% high-flux, 6% low-flux membranes) and 88% (94% high-flux; 83% low-flux membranes) of the patients, respectively. No significant difference was observed in mean pre-HD values between patients dialyzed by low- and high-flux membranes. The overall decrease post-HD of both troponins (-21% and -17% for TnI and TnT, respectively) only reached statistical significance in patients dialyzed by low-flux membranes (-27% and -37% for TnI and TnT, respectively). A significant correlation was observed between absolute variations of TnI and TnT pre-HD to post-HD. CONCLUSIONS: Results of our investigation attest that high-flux membranes clear both troponins more efficiently from circulation than low-flux membranes. Therefore, sampling time and ultrafiltration coefficient of the HD membrane should be regarded as potential sources of variability in the clinical interpretation of troponin measurement in HD patients.",M1
18177543,"Phosphorylation status of regulatory proteins and functional characteristics in myocardium of dilated cardiomyopathy of Syrian hamsters.To understand the pathophysiology of hereditary cardiomyopathy, we measured the phosphorylation status of regulatory proteins, troponin I (TnI), troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), and myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), and the Ca2+-dependence of tension development and ATPase activity in skinned right ventricular trabeculae obtained from cardiomyopathic (TO-2 strain, n = 8) and control (F1B strain, n = 8) hamsters. The Ca2+ sensitivities of tension development and ATPase activity (mean +/- SD) were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) higher in the TO-2 strain (pCa50 5.64 +/- 0.04 in tension and 5.65 +/- 0.04 in ATPase activity) than in the F1B strain (pCa50 5.48 +/- 0.03 in tension and 5.51 +/- 0.03 in ATPase activity). No significant differences in their maximum values were observed between TO-2 (40.8 +/- 7.4 mN/mm2 in tension and 0.52 +/- 0.15 micromol/l/s in ATP consumption) and F1B (42.3 +/- 8.5 mN/mm2 in tension and 0.58 +/- 0.41 micromol/l/s in ATP consumption) preparations, indicating that the tension cost (ATPase activity/tension development) in TO-2 was quite similar to that in F1B. The phosphorylation levels of MLC2 and TnI were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower in TO-2 than in F1B. These results suggest that the increase in the Ca2+ sensitivities of tension development and the ATPase activity in TO-2 hearts result from the decreased basal level of TnI phosphorylation, and these features can be considered to produce the incomplete diastolic relaxation and partly improve the systolic function in TO-2 hearts.",M1
18089541,"Could BNP screening of acute chest pain cases lead to safe earlier discharge of patients with non-cardiac causes? A pilot study.BACKGROUND: The assessment of chest pain relies on clinical assessment and markers of cell necrosis such as Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also raised in myocardial ischaemia and therefore may be useful in deciding if acute chest pain is of cardiac origin or not. AIM: To investigate the role of BNP in the assessment of unselected patients presenting with acute chest pain. METHODS: A prospective observational study of 100 patients presenting with chest pain to the Acute Medical Admissions Unit was carried out. All patients had BNP and TnT levels measured. The primary outcome was categorization of chest pain as cardiac or non-cardiac. This was determined by the discharge diagnosis. BNP cutoffs were derived from a receiver operated characteristic (ROC) curve. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive accuracy (PPA) and negative predictive accuracy (NPA) were all calculated for BNP, TnT and for the composite of BNP and TnT. RESULTS: Mean BNP in patients with cardiac chest pain was significantly greater than mean BNP for patients with non-cardiac chest pain (P &lt;/= 0.0001). BNP was significantly more sensitive than TnT (P = 0.003). However TnT was more specific than BNP (98% vs. 75%, P &lt;/= 0.0001). Combining BNP and TnT increased sensitivity from 55.6% to 95.6%. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BNP is more sensitive but less specific than TnT in the diagnostic assessment of acute chest pain. However, combining BNP and TnT was a very satisfactory rule out test (negative predictive accuracy 96%) for excluding chest pain that had a cardiac origin.",M1
18055619,"Parasites, proteomics and performance: effects of gregarine gut parasites on dragonfly flight muscle composition and function.In previous work, we found that dragonflies infected with gregarine gut parasites have reduced muscle power output, loss of lipid oxidation in their flight muscles, and a suite of symptoms similar to mammalian metabolic syndrome. Here, we test the hypothesis that changes in muscle protein composition underlie the observed changes in contractile performance. We found that gregarine infection was associated with a 10-fold average reduction in abundance of a approximately 155 kDa fragment of muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC; approximately 206 kDa intact size). Insect MHC gene sequences contain evolutionarily conserved amino acid motifs predicted for calpain cleavage, and we found that calpain digestion of purified dragonfly MHC produced a peptide of approximately 155 kDa. Thus, gut parasites in dragonflies are associated with what appears to be a reduction in proteolytic degradation of MHC. MHC155 abundance showed a strong negative relationship to muscle power output in healthy dragonflies but either no relationship or a weakly positive relationship in infected dragonflies. Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) protein isoform profiles were not significantly different between healthy and infected dragonflies but whereas TnT isoform profile was correlated with power output in healthy dragonflies, there was no such correlation in infected dragonflies. Multivariate analyses of power output based on MHC155 abundance and a principal component of TnT protein isoform abundances explained 98% of the variation in muscle power output in healthy dragonflies but only 29% when data from healthy and infected dragonflies were pooled. These results indicate that important, yet largely unexplored, functional relationships exist between (pathways regulating) myofibrillar protein expression and (post-translational) protein processing. Moreover, infection by protozoan parasites of the midgut is associated with changes in muscle protein composition (i.e. across body compartments) that, either alone or in combination with other unmeasured changes, alter muscle contractile performance.",M1
18046527,"Troponin level and efficacy of abciximab in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing early intervention after clopidogrel pretreatment.OBJECTIVE: We investigated how does troponin level (<e>TnT</e>) affect the benefit achieved by abciximab in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after pretreatment with a high loading dose of clopidogrel. METHODS: The Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen: Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment (ISAR-REACT 2) trial included 2,022 patients with non-ST elevation ACS undergoing PCI who were randomized to abciximab or placebo after pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel. The patients were divided into groups with elevated TnT level (n = 1,049) and no elevated TnT level (n = 973). The primary end point of the trial was the composite of death, myocardial infarction and urgent reintervention at 30 days. RESULTS: In patients with elevated TnT level the incidence of the primary end point was 13.1% in the abciximab group Vs. 18.3% in the placebo group [relative risk (RR): 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.95, P = 0.02]. The combined incidence of death or myocardial infarction was 12.9% in the abciximab group vs. 17.9% in the placebo group (RR: 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96, P = 0.03). In contrast, the incidence of the primary end point in patients with no elevated TnT level was identical in both treatment groups (4.6%). The risk of bleeding was not related to TnT level. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline troponin level affects the benefit of abciximab in patients with ACS undergoing PCI after pretreatment with a high loading dose of clopidogrel. Abciximab reduces the risk of ischemic events only in patients with ACS and elevated troponin level.",M1
18032382,"A troponin T mutation that causes infantile restrictive cardiomyopathy increases Ca2+ sensitivity of force development and impairs the inhibitory properties of troponin.Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare disorder characterized by impaired ventricular filling with decreased diastolic volume. We are reporting the functional effects of the first cardiac troponin T (CTnT) mutation linked to infantile RCM resulting from a de novo deletion mutation of glutamic acid 96. The mutation was introduced into adult and fetal isoforms of human cardiac <e>TnT</e> (HCTnT3-DeltaE96 and HCTnT1-DeltaE106, respectively) and studied with either cardiac troponin I (CTnI) or slow skeletal troponin I (SSTnI). Skinned cardiac fiber measurements showed a large leftward shift in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development with no differences in the maximal force. HCTnT1-DeltaE106 showed a significant increase in the activation of actomyosin ATPase with either CTnI or SSTnI, whereas HCTnT3-DeltaE96 was only able to increase the ATPase activity with CTnI. Both mutants showed an impaired ability to inhibit the ATPase activity. The capacity of the CTnI.CTnC and SSTnI.CTnC complexes to fully relax the fibers after TnT displacement was also compromised. Experiments performed using fetal troponin isoforms showed a less severe impact compared with the adult isoforms, which is consistent with the cardioprotective role of SSTnI and the rapid onset of RCM after birth following the isoform switch. These data indicate that troponin mutations related to RCM may have specific functional phenotypes, including large leftward shifts in the Ca(2+) sensitivity and impaired abilities to inhibit ATPase and to relax skinned fibers. All of this would account for and contribute to the severe diastolic dysfunction seen in RCM.",M1
18018381,"[Adiponectinemia, inflammatory process activity, and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome with ST elevation in relation to the severity of lesions in the coronary arteries]INTRODUCTION: Metabolic disorders developing in diabetes are associated with impaired endothelial function and the presence of subclinical inflammation, in consequence leading to generalized atherosclerosis. Vasoprotective factors include adiponectin, a cytokine with a diverse antiatherosclerotic activity. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of adiponectin concentrations and activity of the inflammatory process and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST elevation (STEMI) in relation to the severity of lesions in the coronary arteries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 72 patients (24 women, 48 men) with type 2 diabetes, treated with sulphonylurea derivatives, diagnosed with STEMI, who underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The treated group consisted of 41 patients, mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 64 +/-9.6 years, the Gensini score (GS) &gt;32 points (more advanced lesions in the coronary vessels). The control group consisted of 31 patients, a mean age of 63 +/-10 years, GS &lt;32 points (less advanced lesions). Within 12 hours after the ACS, serum troponin T activity (<e>TnT</e>), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, two adhesion molecules - soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble intercellular adhesive molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were evaluated in serum of the patients. Leucocytosis, glucose and insulin levels, and lipid profiles were obtained after overnight fast conditions. RESULTS: Patients in group I demonstrated a significantly higher TnT and CK-MB (1.39 +/-1.3 vs 0.83 +/-0.74 ng/ml, p &lt;0.05; 139.6 +/-178.5 vs 57.48+/-52.1 IU/I p &lt;0.05, respectively), higher concentrations of CRP (12.06 +/-14.3 vs 3.59 +/-4.1mg/l, p &lt;0.05) fibrinogen (4.59 +/-1.93 vs 3.62 +/-1.36 g/l, p &lt;0.05), sVCAM-1 (1393.4 +/-865.4 vs 863.9+/-425.2 ng/ml, p &lt;0.05) and sICAM-1 (735.1+/-316.3 vs 573.3 +/-226.1 ng/ml, p &lt;0.05), higher leucocytosis (11,430 +/-3680 vs 9750+/-3100/microl, p &lt;0.05) and lower adiponectin concentrations (5.8 +/-5.2 vs 8.3 +/-2.9 8 microg/ml, p &lt;0.05) as compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoadiponectinaemia, severity of the inflammatory process and endothelial dysfunction could be factors contributing to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries in patients with type 2 diabetes.",M1
17986200,"A multimarker risk stratification approach to non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: implications of troponin T, CRP, NT pro-BNP and fibrin D-dimer levels.INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers have emerged as interesting predictors of risk in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (non-ST ACS). The aim of this study was to define the utility of the combined measurement of troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), C-reactive protein (CRP), NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) and D-dimer as biomarkers to predict adverse events. METHODS: We included 358 consecutive patients admitted in two hospitals for non-ST ACS. Baseline measurements of TnT (associated with myocardial injury, positive, if &gt; or =0.1 ng mL(-1)), CRP (a marker of inflammation), NT-proBNP (associated with left ventricular (dys)function) and fibrin D-dimer (and index of thrombogenesis) were performed. A positive CRP, NT-proBNP and D-dimer test was considered upper than the 75th percentile of our population. The risk for major events (death, new ACS, revascularization and heart failure) at 6 months' follow-up was analysed. RESULTS: Troponin T, NT pro-BNP and CRP were predictors of adverse events in the multivariate analysis [hazards ratio (HR): 2.00 (1.30-3.07), P = 0.0016; HR: 2.27 (1.47-3.50), P = 0.0002; HR: 1.90 (1.24-2.92), P = 0.0034 respectively], but not D-dimer levels [HR: 1.26 (0.79-2.02), P = 0.337). After adjusting for baseline characteristics and electrocardiographic changes, multimarker risk approach was associated with adverse events at 6 months, especially with the presence of three positive biomarkers [HR 2.80 (95%CI 1.68-4.68), P &lt; 0.001]. When we divided patients by risk groups [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score], patients with two or three elevated biomarkers had higher event rates [HR 2.59 (95% CI 1.37-4.91), P = 0.004]. CONCLUSION: A multimarker approach based on TnT, CRP and NT-proBNP provides added information to the TIMI risk score in terms of ACS prognosis at 6 months, with a worse outcome for those with two or three elevated biomarkers.",M1
17959729,"Co-expression of skeletal and cardiac troponin T decreases mouse cardiac function.In contrast to skeletal muscles that simultaneously express multiple troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) isoforms, normal adult human cardiac muscle contains a single isoform of cardiac TnT. To understand the significance of myocardial TnT homogeneity, we examined the effect of TnT heterogeneity on heart function. Transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing a fast skeletal muscle TnT together with the endogenous cardiac TnT was investigated in vivo and ex vivo as an experimental system of concurrent presence of two classes of TnT in the adult cardiac muscle. This model of myocardial TnT heterogeneity produced pathogenic phenotypes: echocardiograph imaging detected age-progressive reductions of cardiac function; in vivo left ventricular pressure analysis showed decreased myocardial contractility; ex vivo analysis of isolated working heart preparations confirmed an intrinsic decrease of cardiac function in the absence of neurohumoral influence. The transgenic mice also showed chronic myocardial hypertrophy and degeneration. The dominantly negative effects of introducing a fast TnT into the cardiac thin filaments to produce two classes of Ca(2+) regulatory units in the adult myocardium suggest that TnT heterogeneity decreases contractile function by disrupting the synchronized action during ventricular contraction that is normally activated as an electrophysiological syncytium.",M1
17891611,"Relative role of NT-pro BNP and cardiac troponin T at 96 hours for estimation of infarct size and left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have proven useful for prediction of prognosis and may be valuable for assessment of left ventricular function and infarct size. The aim of the present study was to correlate infarct size and left ventricular function determined by cine and late gadolinium enhanced CMR with plasma levels of <e>TNT</e> and NT-pro BNP levels after AMI. METHODS: We studied 44 patients (pts) with first ST- and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI=23 pts.,NSTEMI=21 pts.). We measured NT-pro BNP and cTnT on a single occasion at 96 hours after onset of symptoms. RESULTS: There was a moderate inverse correlation between NT-pro BNP and LV-EF in STEMI (r=-0.67, p=0.0009) and NSTEMI (r=-0.85, p&lt;0.0001). Likewise, cTnT showed a significant inverse correlation with LV-EF in STEMI (r=-0.54, p=0.014) but not in NSTEMI. With cTnT there was a strong linear correlation with infarct mass and relative infarct size in STEMI (r=0.92, p&lt;0.0001) and NSTEMI (r=0.59, p&lt;0.0093). NT-pro BNP demonstrated a good relationship with infarct mass (r=0.79, p&lt;0.0001) and relative infarct size (r=0.75, p&lt;0.0001) in STEMI, but not in NSTEMI. CONCLUSION: A single NT-pro BNP and cTnT value at 96 hours after onset of symptoms proved useful for estimation of LV-EF and infarct size. In direct comparison, NT-pro BNP disclosed a better performance for estimation of LV-EF whereas cTnT was superior for assessment of infarct mass and relative infarct size, suggesting an implementation of a dual marker strategy for diagnostic and prognostic work-up.",M1
17852782,"The relationship between ASAT, CKMB, troponin-T and mortality after cardiac surgery.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between ASAT, CKMB, troponin-T and mortality after cardiac surgery. DESIGN: ASAT, CKMB and <e>TnT</e> were analysed in 116 patients. Correlation, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for permanent myocardial injury (defined as TnT &gt; or = 2.0 microg/l postoperative day four) were calculated. In the second part our clinical protocol (ASAT on postoperative day 1 and TnT on day 3-4 in patients with ASAT above 2.5 microkat/l) was evaluated. Mortality was compared between patients with ASAT &lt; 2.5 microkat/l (ASAT-), 2. ASAT &gt; or = 2.5 microkat/l and TnT &lt; 2.0 microg/l (ASAT+/TnT-) and 3. ASAT &gt; or = 2.5 microkat/l and TnT &gt; or = 2.0 microg/l (ASAT+/TnT+). RESULTS: Both ASAT and CKMB had irrespectively of cut-off level, low positive and high negative predictive value of permanent myocardial injury. Early and mid-term mortality did not differ significantly between ASAT- and ASAT+/TnT- patients. CONCLUSIONS: ASAT and CKMB can be used to exclude but not to diagnose permanent myocardial injury after cardiac surgery. Increased postoperative ASAT in the absence of increased TnT is not associated with worse clinical outcome than after normal postoperative ASAT.",M1
17848144,"Troponin T and histological characteristics of rat myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol.In our investigation,we used short-time model of myocardial infarction of rats induced by high dose of isoproterenol (ISP). We investigated cardiac troponin T blood level (cTnT) and histological characteristics of rat myocardium. ISP, single, intraperitoneal dose 250 mg/kg was given to male, adult, Wistar rats (n=12). Rats were distributed depending on their body weight in subgroups: ISP I (BW 260-280g) and ISP II (BW 250-400g).Control group (n=9) was treated with intraperitoneal dose of 0,95% NaCl. Cardiac <e>TnT</e> was measured by electrochemiluminiscence (ECLA) sandwich immunoassay in rat serum 4 hours after ISP application. Rats' hearts were dissected and examined by qualitative histological method (HE). Statistical significance was set at 0,05. There was significant difference in cTnT of ISP II (p=0,0001) vs. control and ISP I (p&lt;0,05) vs. control. Significant difference was between ISP I and ISP II subgroups (p&lt;0.001). The accent of histological changes of myocardium was on nuclei of cell. Cells showed acidophilic changes and nuclei disappearance as signs of coagulative necrosis development. Extensivity of histological changes were different between ISP I and ISP II subgroup. Used dose of ISP induced development of myocardial necrosis in rats. Subendocardial portion of myocardium was more vulnerability than subepicardial portion. Rats of ISP II had more extensive histological changes than these in ISP I.

17805990,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 improves the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in a rat model of myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Previous study demonstrated the improvement of cardiac function was proportional to the number of cells implanted. Therefore, increasing cell survival in the infarcted myocardium might contribute to the improvement of the functional benefit of cell transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: MSCs were treated with IGF-1 in vitro and infused into the acute myocardial infarction rats via the tail vein. After treatment of MSCs with IGF-1 for 48 h, flow cytometric analysis showed marked enhancement of expression of CXCR4 in the cell surface. After 4 weeks of transplantation, we found 1) a greater number of engrafted MSCs arrived and survived in the peri-infarct region; 2) <e>TnT</e> protein expression and capillary density were enhanced; 3) LV cavitary dilation, transmural infarct thinning, deposition of total collagen in the peri-infarct region and cardiac dysfunction were attenuated. CONCLUSION: 1) IGF-1 treatment has time-dependent and dose-dependent effects on CXCR4 expression in MSCs in vitro. 2) IGF-1 improves the efficacy of MSCs transplantation in a rat model of myocardial infarction mainly via enhancement of the number of cells attracted into the infarcted heart. These findings provide a novel stem cell therapeutic avenue against ischemic heart disease.",M1
17663815,"[The predictive value of B-type natriuretic peptide for the mortality from acute myocardial infarction]OBJECTIVE: To explore the predictive value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for the mortality of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: Follow-up was made in 264 consecutive patients with AMI, with an average period of (14.7 +/- 5.3) months and follow-up rate of 87.1% (230 cases). Cardiac death was recorded in the 1st, 6th and 12th month after AMI. Among one to seven days after AMI, the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), echocardiographically measured left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter (LVEDd), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and BNP were determined. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) were drawn to determine the predictive value for the cardiac death after AMI comparing BNP with the classical risk factors mentioned above. Analysis was made to define the relative independent risk factors of cardiac death and non-cardiac death survival rate after AMI. RESULTS: The ROC curves comparing CK-MB, TnT, LVEDd and LVEF with BNP and lnBNP showed that BNP was the only index for predicting cardiac death after AMI, the cut off point value of BNP determined according to ROC curve was 864 ng/L and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values for predicting the cardiac death was 76.2% - 92.9%, 84.3% - 85.6%, 82.2% - 86.1%, 21.3% - 36.2% and 97.3% - 98.9% at the 1st 16th, 12th month after AMI respectively. Furthermore, BNP showed the only independent risk factor for predicting the cardiac death in the short and long term period after AMI (P &lt; 0.01) by multiple factors cox regression analysis. The non-cardiac death survival rate in the group of BNP level &lt; or = 864 ng/L was significantly higher than that in the group of BNP &gt; 864 ng/L (97.3% vs 72.3%, P &lt; 0.001), and the median survival time of the dead in the former group was also significantly longer than in the latter group (16.0 vs 10.7, P &lt; 0.01), no matter whether they were suffering from AMI with ST elevation or not, treated with or without primary PCI.

17652885,"Randomized trial of statin administration for myocardial injury: is intensive lipid-lowering more beneficial than moderate lipid-lowering before percutaneous coronary intervention?BACKGROUND: Minor myocardial damage after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with cardiac risks, which statins seem to reduce. The aim of this study was to examine whether intensive lipid-lowering therapy is more effective in decreasing the risk of cardiac injury after PCI than moderate lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects comprised 42 patients with stable angina without previous statin treatment, randomly assigned to either an intensive lipid-lowering group (Group A: target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)&lt;70 mg/dl) or a moderate lipid-lowering group (Group B: target LDL-C&lt;100 mg/dl) 2 weeks before PCI. All patients took statins to reach target LDL-C levels. Incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury was assessed by analyzing levels of creatine kinase myocardial isozyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) before and 6, 12 and 24 h after PCI. Minor myocardial damage was defined as TnT elevation to &gt;0.01 ng/ml. Frequency of minor myocardial damage was 14.2% in Group A and 47.6% in Group B (p=0.043). CK-MB was above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 19% of Group A and 33.3% of Group B (p=0.44), and CK-MB was &gt;3x ULN in 9.5% of Group A and 19% of Group B (p=0.66).

17603127,"Aberrant splicing of an alternative exon in the Drosophila troponin-T gene affects flight muscle development.During myofibrillogenesis, many muscle structural proteins assemble to form the highly ordered contractile sarcomere. Mutations in these proteins can lead to dysfunctional muscle and various myopathies. We have analyzed the Drosophila melanogaster troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) up1 mutant that specifically affects the indirect flight muscles (IFM) to explore troponin function during myofibrillogenesis. The up1 muscles lack normal sarcomeres and contain  zebra bodies,  a phenotypic feature of human nemaline myopathies. We show that the up(1) mutation causes defective splicing of a newly identified alternative TnT exon (10a) that encodes part of the TnT C terminus. This exon is used to generate a TnT isoform specific to the IFM and jump muscles, which during IFM development replaces the exon 10b isoform. Functional differences between the 10a and 10b TnT isoforms may be due to different potential phosphorylation sites, none of which correspond to known phosphorylation sites in human cardiac TnT. The absence of TnT mRNA in up1 IFM reduces mRNA levels of an IFM-specific troponin I (TnI) isoform, but not actin, tropomyosin, or troponin C, suggesting a mechanism controlling expression of TnT and TnI genes may exist that must be examined in the context of human myopathies caused by mutations of these thin filament proteins.",M1
17584270,"Difference in humoral biomarkers for myocardial injury and inflammation in radiofrequency ablation versus cryoablation.BACKGROUND: Markers of myocardial injury and inflammation have been shown to be elevated following radiofrequency (RF) ablation. This study aimed to compare RF ablation and cryoablation for their impact on markers for myocardial injury and inflammation. METHODS: Nineteen patients received catheter ablation for atrial flutter by either cryoablation (10 patients) or open-irrigated RF ablation (nine patients). Venous blood samples for troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), creatinkinase (CK), and the cardiac isoenzyme MB (CKMB) were obtained before, at six hours after the end of ablation, and the following day. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured before ablation and the following day. RESULTS: Bidirectional isthmus block was achieved in all patients. Cryoablation showed significantly higher TnT following ablation (0.85 microg/l +/- 0.39 microg/l) compared to RF ablation (0.36 microg/l +/- 0.24 microg/l; p= 0.01) with declining levels the following day (cryoablation: 0.58 microg/l +/- 0.20 microg/l; RF ablation 0.34 microg/l +/- 0.21 microg/l; p= 0.03). We observed equal findings for CK and CKMB, both significantly higher in cryoablation. RF ablation led to a nonsignificant rise in CK and CKMB. CRP was elevated significantly higher following RF ablation (12.3 mg/dl +/- 4.1 mg/dl) compared to cryoablation (6.9 mg/dl +/- 4.0 mg/dl; p= 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We show reduced inflammation despite higher markers for myocardial injury in cryoablation. The difference in biomarkers reflects different lesion formation in cryoablation and RF ablation. Cryoablation shows less systemic inflammatory reaction. This might be due to less endothelial damage and surface thrombosis in cryoablation.",M1
17584264,"Detectable troponin levels predict poor prognosis in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing internal defibrillator implantation.INTRODUCTION: Troponin levels have been demonstrated to predict mortality in patients with cardiomyopathy. Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) devices have been demonstrated to improve survival. It is not clear if ICDs would mitigate the negative outcome predicted by elevated troponin levels. METHODS: We collected baseline blood samples for troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and creatinine kinase-MB fraction in consecutive patients immediately before successful pectoral transvenous ICD implant. Patients were followed for total mortality. For analysis, patients were grouped by TnT detectability (&gt;or=0.01 ng/mL). RESULTS: Fifty-two men, aged 68 +/- 10 years, were studied. Mean ejection fraction was 29 +/- 12% and 65% had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Follow-up duration was 17 +/- 8 months. None of the patients had abnormal creatinine kinase-MB fraction levels (1.7 +/- 1.1 ng/mL). There were 37 patients with no detectable TnT (Group I) and 15 with detectable TnT (Group II). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age (68 vs 69, P = NS), ejection fraction (30 vs 29%, P = NS), or proportion of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (68 vs 60%, P = NS). During follow-up 16 (31%) patients died. Patients in group I had mortality of 16% (6/37) compared to 67% mortality (10/15, P &lt; 0.001) in group II. On multivariate analysis, detectable TnT remained an independent predictor of mortality (HR 4.5, CI 1.4-14.25, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with cardiomyopathy undergoing ICD implantation for standard clinical indications, presence of detectable TnT was associated with high mortality despite ICD implantation.

The effect of THs on muscle and in particular muscle sarcomer protein genes is largely unexplored in fish. The change in Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), a pivotal protein in the assembly of skeletal muscles sarcomeres and a modulator of calcium driven muscle contraction, during flatfish metamophosis is studied. RESULTS: In the present study five cDNAs for halibut TnT genes were cloned; three were splice variants arising from a single fast TnT (fTnT) gene; a fourth encoded a novel teleost specific fTnT-like cDNA (AfTnT) expressed exclusively in slow muscle and the fifth encoded the teleost specific sTnT2. THs modified the expression of halibut fTnT isoforms which changed from predominantly basic to acidic isoforms during natural and T4 induced metamorphosis. In contrast, expression of red muscle specific genes, AfTnT and sTnT2, did not change during natural metamorphosis or after T4 treatment. Prior to and after metamorphosis no change in the dorso-ventral symmetry or temporal-spatial expression pattern of TnT genes and muscle fibre organization occurred in halibut musculature. CONCLUSION: Muscle organisation in halibut remains symmetrical even after metamorphosis suggesting TH driven changes are associated with molecular adaptations. We hypothesize that species specific differences in TnT gene expression in teleosts underlies different larval muscle developmental programs which better adapts them to the specific ecological constraints.",M1
17541763,"Diagnostic value of D-dimer measurement in patients referred to the emergency department with suspected myocardial ischemia.BACKGROUND: The accurate identification of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains one of the most difficult challenges facing emergency physicians. The introduction of early and reliable biomarkers of AMI should hence be acknowledged, since they would increase the efficiency of the diagnostic process. METHODS: A total of 2,276 consecutive patients referred to the emergency department for clinical symptoms suggestive for AMI underwent cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and D-dimer testing between January and December 2006. Patients sample were eligible for inclusion in this investigation if they had been collected prior to medication or intervention and 12-24 h after the time of patient's arrival to the emergency department, when the diagnostic efficiency of cTnT is the highest. cTnT was assayed on the Elecsys 2010 and test results were stratified according to the decisional threshold corresponding to the lowest <e>TnT</e> concentration associated with a 10% total imprecision in the assay (&gt;0.03 microg/l). Plasma D-dimer was measured employing Vidas DD. RESULTS: The results of 741 patient's samples fulfilled the above criteria and were included in the study, 252 (34%) of whom had cTnT values&gt;0.03 microg/l. The D-dimer value distribution (median and 95% C.I.) was significantly different in patients with cTnT values&gt;0.03 microg/l than in those with cTnT values&lt;0.03 microg/l (2,227 microg/l, 431-10,000 microg/l versus 1,039 microg/l, 143-6,338 microg/l; P&lt;0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was 0.734 (95% confidence interval: 0.715-0.753; P&lt;0.001). At the 500 microg/l diagnostic threshold estimated by the ROC curve analysis, corresponding to the cut-off for the diagnosis of VTE, sensitivity and specificity of Vidas D-dimer were 95% and 27%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were estimated as 92% and 41%, respectively. In linear regression analysis, no significant association (r=0.090; P=0.077) was observed between D-dimer and cTnT in patients with cTnT levels exceeding the decisional threshold of the assay. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present investigation on patients with AMI established by accepted diagnostic criteria (cTnT values above the decisional threshold of the assay associated with suggestive clinical symptoms), testify that D-dimer testing would not add clinically meaningful information to the sole determination of the cardiospecific troponins 12-24 h after patient's admission at the emergency department, when the cumulative data indicate that the diagnostic efficiency of cTnT is the highest.",M1
17526570,"R-92L and R-92W mutations in cardiac troponin T lead to distinct energetic phenotypes in intact mouse hearts.It is now known that the flexibility of the troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) tail determines thin filament conformation and hence cross-bridge cycling properties, expanding the classic structural role of TnT to a dynamic role regulating sarcomere function. Here, using transgenic mice bearing R-92W and R-92L missense mutations in cardiac TnT known to alter the flexibility of the TnT tropomyosin-binding domain, we found mutation-specific differences in the cost of contraction at the whole heart level. Compared to age- and gender-matched sibling hearts, mutant hearts demonstrate greater ATP utilization measured using (31)P NMR spectroscopy as decreases in [ATP] and [PCr] and |DeltaG(~ATP)| at all workloads and profound systolic and diastolic dysfunction at all energetic states. R-92W hearts showed more severe energetic abnormalities and greater contractile dysfunction than R-92L hearts. The cost of increasing contraction was abnormally high when [Ca(2+)] was used to increase work in mutant hearts but was normalized with supply of the beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine. These results show that R-92L and R-92W mutations in the TM-binding domain of cardiac TnT alter thin filament structure and flexibility sufficiently to cause severe defects in both whole heart energetics and contractile performance, and that the magnitude of these changes is mutation specific.",M1
17461983,"Elevated levels of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 in acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation and apoptosis-specific immune activation play a major role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The role of systemic and coronary obtained inflammatory plasma protein interleukin-1beta precursor (IL-1betap), IL-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE) and the apoptosis-specific caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (ccCK-18) are not known in ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from stable angina (SA, n = 34), unstable angina (UA, n = 37) and patients with AMI (n = 39). Coronary blood was acquired by means of thrombectomy devices (X-sizer) in AMI patients. IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Group comparisons were evaluated by parametric Tukey test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive values of IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 as compared to creatine kinase (CK) and troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) in order to relate these markers with the occurrence of myocardial damage. RESULTS: IL-1betap, ICE and ccCK-18 were identified to be significantly altered in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from AMI as compared to SA and UA. ROC curves were plotted and revealed that ccCK-18 is a novel sensitive marker for the detection of myocardial damage as compared to TnT or CK. (AUC ccCK-18 0.925, TnT AUC 0.62 and CK AUC 0.858.) Moreover, ICE and ccCK-18 were significantly increased at the site of coronary occlusion as compared to peripheral blood samples in AMI patients (both P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ACS is related to increased concentration of systemic soluble ICE and ccCK-18. Moreover, soluble ccCK-18 was identified to be a superior marker as compared to TnT or CK, for detection of myocardial damage.",M1
17445406,"[Calpain I inhibition prevents pacing-induced structural remodeling for atrial fibrillation in canine]OBJECTIVE: To study the relation of the structural remodeling processes and activation of calpain I. METHODS: Fifteen dogs were randomly divided into three groups. The dogs in pacing group (n=5) and inhibitor group (n=5) were subjected to 3 weeks of rapid atrial pacing at 600 beats/min, control dogs (n=5) were in sham-operated group. The dogs in inhibitor group were administered intravenous N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met (ALLM), a calpain inhibitor, and in pacing group and sham-operated group were administered intravenous DMSO. The activity of calpain I was measured by hydrolyzing Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin. The ultrastructure of atrium was examined by light and electron microscopy. <e>TnT</e> expression was assessed by Western blot. Echocardiography examination was performed in all the three groups. RESULTS: Calpain I activity was significantly increased in pacing group (2.3-fold, P&lt;0.01), and decreased in inhibitor group (1.1-fold, P&gt;0.05), compared to sham-operated group respectively. The percentages of myolysis were (76.7 +/- 5.9)% and (20.8 +/- 8.1)% in pacing group and inhibitor group respectively (P&lt;0.01). TnT expression decreased in the rapid pacing-induced persistent atrial fibrillation, and these effects were inhibited by calpain I inhibitor ALLM. The area and volume of left atrium tended to increase after 3 weeks ALLM treatment in inhibitor group, but the change was not as prominent as in pacing group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ALLM can decrease calpain I activity, and prevent canine atrial cardiomyocyte structural remodeling during atrial fibrillation. This study provided a capacity of atrial cardiomyocyte protection.",M1
17408776,"Right ventricle injury during acute pulmonary embolism leads to its remodeling.Right ventricular (RV) overload and hypoxia in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) may lead to RV myocardium injury reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels. We studied 26 patients aged 57.2+/-17.8 years with first episode of APE. On admission troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) was measured. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed after 6 months of anticoagulation. Myocardial injury (TnT &gt; or =0.03 ng/ml) was observed in 8 (30.8%) patients at the diagnosis. At follow up RV diastolic area tended to be larger in group with myocardial injury (25.0 (20.8-38.6) vs 18.4 (17.7-23.3) cm(2), p=0.06). Tricuspid annulus systolic velocity at tissue Doppler was lower in group with myocardial injury (0.12 (0.11-0.13) vs 0.15 (0.13-0.21) m/s, p=0.04), while no such a relationship was found for mitral annulus systolic velocity. TnT concentration correlated with RV diastolic area (r=0.61) and tricuspid annulus systolic velocity (r=-0.58) although not significantly (p=0.08 and p=0.09. respectively). Our data suggest that RV injury in acute phase of PE may lead to its remodeling.",M1
17408593,"Role of myofibril-inducing RNA in cardiac <e>TnT</e> expression in developing Mexican axolotl.The Mexican axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, has been a useful animal model to study heart development and cardiac myofibrillogenesis. A naturally-occurring recessive mutant, gene  c , for cardiac non-function in the Mexican axolotl causes a failure of myofibrillogenesis due to a lack of tropomyosin expression in homozygous mutant (c/c) embryonic hearts. Myofibril-inducing RNA (MIR) rescues mutant hearts in vitro by promoting tropomyosin expression and myofibril formation thereafter. We have studied the effect of MIR on the expression of various isoforms of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), a component of the thin filament that binds with tropomyosin. Four alternatively spliced cTnT isoforms have been characterized from developing axolotl heart. The expression of various cTnT isoforms in normal, mutant, and mutant hearts corrected with MIR, is evaluated by real-time RT-PCR using isoform specific primer pairs; MIR affects the total transcription as well as the splicing of the cTnT in axolotl heart.",M1
17395052,"Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein is more sensitive than troponin T to detect the ongoing myocardial damage in chronic heart failure patients.BACKGROUND: Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a small cytosolic protein and released into the circulation when the myocardium is injured. Previous studies have demonstrated that both H-FABP and troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) are detectable in venous blood samples in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients, suggesting the presence of ongoing myocardial damage (OMD). We hypothesized that a cytosolic marker (H-FABP) is more sensitive than a myofibrillar component (TnT) in the detection of OMD in CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured serum H-FABP and TnT levels in 126 consecutive CHF patients at admission, and patients were followed-up with a mean period of 474 +/- 328 days. Cutoff values for H-FABP (4.3 ng/mL) and TnT (0.01 ng/mL) were determined from previous studies. Positive rate of H-FABP was higher than that of TnT in all CHF patients (46% [58/126] versus 26% [33/126], P &lt; .0001), and in severe CHF (New York Heart Association III/IV) patients (69% [34/49] versus 47% [23/49], P = .0121). There were 27 cardiac events during a follow-up period. In patients with cardiac events, H-FABP was more frequently detected than TnT (88% [24/27] versus 44% [12/27], P = .0103). There were 33 patients with positive H-FABP among 93 patients with negative TnT. Those patients had more severe New York Heart Association class, higher levels of brain natriuretic peptide, and higher rates of cardiac events (36% versus 5%, P &lt; .0001) compared with those both H-FABP and TnT were negative. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that in patients with negative TnT, positive H-FABP group had higher risk for cardiac events than negative H-FABP group (P &lt; .0001). A multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazard model showed that H-FABP was the only independent predictor of cardiac events (hazard ratio 15.677, P = .0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was larger for H-FABP than for TnT (0.779 versus 0.581; P = .009), suggesting that H-FABP had greater predictive capacity for cardiac events than TnT. CONCLUSIONS: H-FABP was more sensitive to detect OMD and could identify patients at high risk more effectively than TnT.",M1
17350907,"Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of the proximity changes between the central helix of troponin C and the C-terminus of troponin T from chicken skeletal muscle.Recent structural studies of the troponin (Tn) core complex have shown that the regulatory head containing the N-lobe of TnC is connected to the IT arm by a flexible linker of TnC. The IT arm is a long coiled-coil formed by alpha-helices of TnI and <e>TnT</e>, plus the C-lobe of TnC. The TnT is thought to play a pivotal role in the linking of Ca(2+) -triggered conformational changes in thin filament regulatory proteins to the activation of cross-bridge cycling. However, a functional domain at the C-terminus of TnT is missing from the Tn core complex. In this study, we intended to determine the proximity relationship between the central helix of TnC and the TnT C-terminus in the binary and the ternary complex with and without Ca2+ by using pyrene excimer fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Chicken fast skeletal TnC contains a Cys102 at the E helix, while TnT has a Cys264 at its C-terminus. These two cysteines were specifically labeled with sulfhydryl-reactive fluorescence probes. The measured distance in the binary complex was about 19 Angstroms and slightly increased when they formed the ternary complex with TnI (20 Angstroms). Upon Ca2+ binding the distance was not affected in the binary complex but increased by approximately 4 Angstroms in the ternary complex. These results suggest that TnI plays an essential role in the Ca(2+) -mediated change in the spatial relationship between the C-lobe of TnC and the C-terminus of TnT.",M1
17260966,"Troponin T core structure and the regulatory NH2-terminal variable region.The conserved central and COOH-terminal regions of troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) interact with troponin C, troponin I, and tropomyosin to regulate striated muscle contraction. Phylogenic data show that the NH2-terminal region has evolved as an addition to the conserved core structure of TnT. This NH2-terminal region does not bind other thin filament proteins, and its sequence is hypervariable between fiber type and developmental isoforms. Previous studies have demonstrated that NH2-terminal modifications alter the COOH-terminal conformation of TnT and thin filament Ca2+-activation, yet the functional core structure of TnT and the mechanism of NH2-terminal modulation are not well understood. To define the TnT core structure and investigate the regulatory role of the NH2-terminal variable region, we investigated two classes of model TnT molecules: (1) NH2-terminal truncated cardiac TnT and (2) chimera proteins consisting of an acidic or basic skeletal muscle TnT NH2-terminus spliced to the cardiac TnT core. Deletion of the TnT hypervariable NH2-terminus preserved binding to troponin I and tropomyosin and sustained cardiac muscle contraction in the heart of transgenic mice. Further deletion of the conserved central region diminished binding to tropomyosin. The reintroduction of differently charged NH2-terminal domains in the chimeric molecules produced long-range conformational changes in the central and COOH-terminal regions to alter troponin I and tropomyosin binding. Similar NH2-terminal charge effects are demonstrated in naturally occurring cardiac TnT isoforms, indicating a physiological significance. These results suggest that the hypervariable NH2-terminal region modulates the conformation and function of the TnT core structure to fine-tune muscle contractility.",M1
17196472,"Frequency and significance of troponin T elevation in acute ischemic stroke.Elevated levels of troponin have been reported in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In this prospective study, the prevalence and characteristics of troponin elevation were examined in 244 patients with acute ischemic stroke but without overt ischemic heart disease. Troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) concentrations were measured and 12-lead electrocardiograms obtained daily during the first 5 days of admission. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was performed in patients with TnT levels of 0.10 micro g/L and in comparable controls without elevation of TnT. Patients were followed for a mean of 19 +/- 7 months, with all-cause mortality as the clinical end point. Elevated levels of TnT (&gt;0.03 micro g/L) and creatine kinase-MB (&gt; or =10 micro g/L) were observed in 10% and 9% of patients, respectively. Patients with elevated TnT had higher frequencies of heart and/or renal failure. Perfusion abnormalities on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy at rest were not more frequent or pronounced in patients with TnT levels of &gt; or =0.10 micro g/L than in the control group. Only 7 patients (3%) had elevations of TnT or creatine kinase-MB and electrocardiographic changes suggesting acute myocardial infarctions. According to univariate and multivariate analyses, elevation of TnT was significantly associated with mortality. In conclusion, elevated levels of TnT are rare in patients presenting with ischemic stroke but without overt ischemic heart disease. Heart and renal failure rather than myocardial infarction are the most likely causes. When present, elevation of TnT seems to be useful in identifying patients who are at increased risk of dying within the following 2 years.",M1
17194691,"Mutations in fast skeletal troponin I, troponin T, and beta-tropomyosin that cause distal arthrogryposis all increase contractile function.Distal arthrogryposes (DAs) are a group of disorders characterized by congenital contractures of distal limbs without overt neurological or muscle disease. Unexpectedly, mutations in genes encoding the fast skeletal muscle regulatory proteins troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), troponin I (TnI), and beta-tropomyosin (beta-TM) have been shown to cause autosomal dominant DA. We tested how these mutations affect contractile function by comparing wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins in actomyosin ATPase assays and in troponin-replaced rabbit psoas fibers. We have analyzed all four reported mutants: Arg63His TnT, Arg91Gly beta-TM, Arg174Gln TnI, and a TnI truncation mutant (Arg156ter). Thin filaments, reconstituted using actin and WT troponin and beta-TM, activated myosin subfragment-1 ATPase in a calcium-dependent, cooperative manner. Thin filaments containing either a troponin or beta-TM DA mutant produced significantly enhanced ATPase rates at all calcium concentrations without alternating calcium-sensitivity or cooperativity. In troponin-exchanged skinned fibers, each mutant caused a significant increase in Ca2+ sensitivity, and Arg156ter TnI generated significantly higher maximum force. Arg91Gly beta-TM was found to have a lower actin affinity than WT and form a less stable coiled coil. We propose the mutations cause increased contractility of developing fast-twitch skeletal muscles, thus causing muscle contractures and the development of the observed limb deformities.",M1
17161244,"Cardiac troponin T at 96 hours after acute myocardial infarction correlates with infarct size and cardiac function.OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice, myocardial infarct size can be estimated non-invasively by nuclear imaging techniques or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI). Due to limited availability and high costs, serologic tests are frequently used as an alternative. BACKGROUND: We examined the ability of a single value of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) 96 h after onset of ST-/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI) to estimate absolute infarct mass. METHODS: Functional and CE-MRI were conducted on a 1.5-T whole-body system 4 days after STEMI/NSTEMI using gadolinium (0.2 mmol/kg/bw). Infarct sizes were measured employing a specified software (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) and correlated with <e>TnT</e> measurements 96 h after onset of STEMI/NSTEMI. RESULTS: We enrolled 23 STEMI and 21 NSTEMI patients. Median time delay from onset of symptoms to balloon angioplasty was 6.25 and 9.9 h for STEMI/NSTEMI patients, respectively. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (median 4 days) revealed an absolute mean infarct size of 16.2 g (7.7 to 30.1 g) with a mean ejection fraction of 58% (53% to 63%) and mean stroke volume of 84 ml (75 to 107 ml). Absolute infarct sizes and median cTnT values were larger in STEMI than in NSTEMI (29.3 g [interquartile range (IQR) 16.0 to 53.0] and 1.88 microg/l [IQR 0.7 to 2.57] vs. 8.8 g [IQR 3.3 to 16.4] and 0.83 microg/l [IQR 0.4 to 1.3], both p &lt; 0.02). Linear regression analysis was excellent for STEMI (r = 0.910) and moderate albeit still significant for NSTEMI (r = 0.575). CONCLUSIONS: A single 96-h cTnT value provides an accurate estimate of absolute infarct mass in myocardial infarction. The ability to quantify and the potential to distinguish effects of novel drug regimens on infarct size make cTnT attractive for routine practice and as a clinical end point.",M1

17151819,"The use of human heart-type fatty acid-binding protein as an early diagnostic biochemical marker of myocardial necrosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and its comparison with troponin-T and creatine kinase-myocardial band.Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), a new biochemical marker of sarcolemmal injury due to acute myocardial ischemia, can be used as a tool in early diagnosis and management of patients at high risk. The aim of this study was to determine the early diagnostic value of H-FABP in acute coronary syndrome (within 6-24 h of chest pain) and to compare it with troponin-T (<e>TnT</e>) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) for accuracy. The study consisted of 40 consecutive patients with chest pain admitted to the coronary care unit with the diagnosis of suspected acute coronary syndrome. The patient population consisted of two groups according to the time of admission; the first group (26 patients) included patients admitted within 6 h of chest pain, and the second group (14 patients) included patients admitted within 6-24 h of chest pain. The blood samples for H-FABP, TnT, and CK-MB were obtained at admittance, at the 6th, and at the 24th hours for the first group, and at admittance and at the 24th hours for the second. Statistical analysis was performed among the 26 patients for the first 6 h values, and among all 40 patients for the values obtained within 6-24 h and at the 24th hour. The patients were then divided into groups according to the changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes as unstable angina pectoris, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and ST-elevation MI. Coronary angiography was performed in 38 (95%) patients. Sensitivity of TnT, CK-MB, and H-FABP in the first group (within 6 h of chest pain) were 38%, 76%, and 95% respectively. The sensitivity of H-FABP was significantly higher than TnT (P=0.014). Sensitivity of TnT, CK-MB, and H-FABP tests in the second time period (within 6-24 h of chest pain) were 100%, 90%, and 91% respectively. In this time period, the sensitivity of TnT was higher than H-FABP, but it was statistically insignificant. At the 24th hour, sensitivity of TnT was 100%, CK-MB 90%, and H-FABP 27.3%, and TnT and CK-MB were more sensitive than H-FABP for the whole group (P=0.002). In the first group (within 6 h of chest pain) H-FABP positivity was slightly but insignificantly higher in patients with two- and three-vessel disease compared with those with one-vessel disease (60.7% and 33.3%, P=0.19) and in the same group, patients who underwent primary coronary intervention had a significantly higher H-FABP positivity than others (80%, 32%, P=0.02). Within 6-24 h of chest pain, H-FABP positivity was 80% in patients with one-vessel disease and 71.4% in patients with two- and three-vessel disease (P=0.69). Within 6-24 h, positivity of H-FABP reached a peak value of 100% in patients who underwent primary coronary intervention, while H-FABP was positive in 60% of the others (P&lt;0.001). We conclude that within the 6 h of acute coronary syndrome, H-FABP seems to be a more sensitive biochemical marker than TnT in the early detection of ischemic myocardial necrosis. But after the first 6 h of the onset of chest pain the sensitivity of H-FABP decreases, and this marker should not be used alone in patients admitted 24 h after the onset of chest pain.",M1
17146489,"Prognostic value of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with chronic heart failure.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has prognostic value in patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS: Serum hsCRP levels were measured with high-sensitivity assay (IMMAGE Immunochemistry Systems) in 128 patients with CHF and 25 healthy control subjects. Cardiac troponin T (<e>TNT</e>) was measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on an Elecsys1010 automatic analyser. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death and rehospitalisation because of worsening heart failure during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Circulating levels of hsCRP and TNT were significantly higher in patients with CHF than in the 25 healthy people (p=0.0028, p=0.017, respectively) and increased with severity of CHF. During a mean follow-up period of 378 +/- 26 days, 42 (32.8%) of the 128 patients had cardiac events. Levels of hsCRP and TNT were significantly higher (p=0.00031, p=0.00047, respectively) and LVEF was significantly lower (p=0.0052) in patients with cardiac events than in patients without cardiac events. When multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed, we found that hsCRP, TNT, and LVEF were independent significant predictors of cardiac events in patients with CHF (hsCRP: hazard ratio [HR], 3.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.14-9.35; p=0.024; TNT: HR, 2.61; 95%CI, 1.96-4.31; p=0.012; LVEF: HR, 3.52; 95%CI, 2.36-10.37; p=0.024). When Pearson's correlation analyses were performed, we could find a positive correlation between hsCRP and TNT (r=0.493, p=0.0043) and a negative correlation between hsCRP and LVEF(r=-0.354, p=0.0051). CONCLUSION: Serum hsCRP concentrations were elevated in patients with CHF and increased with severity of CHF. It was an independent significant predictor of cardiac events in patients with CHF.",M1
17134622,"Brain natriuretic peptide and other risk markers for outcome assessment in patients with non-ST-elevation coronary syndromes and preserved systolic function.Several emerging cardiac markers constitute strong predictors among patients with coronary artery disease. In particular, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are related to increased risk of recurrent ischemic events and death. However, little is known about the utility of these biomarkers in combination. This study examined risk assessment in patients with coronary artery disease and preserved systolic function. We studied 208 consecutive patients (138 men, 70 women) with stable angina, unstable angina, and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction whose plasma BNP, TnT, and CRP levels were measured at hospital admission. All recruited patients underwent echocardiographic examination, and selective coronary angiography was performed. After adjusting for clinical presentation, age, gender, and common risk factors, BNP was demonstrated as a strong predictor of heart failure (6 months, odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 2.9, p &lt;0.01; 12 months, OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.5, p &lt;0.001) and mortality at 3, 6, and 12 months (p &lt;0.001). BNP was also significantly related to extent of coronary artery disease and left anterior descending artery involvement (p &lt;0.01). Patients with a BNP level &gt;80 pg/ml in all 3 groups had a significantly poorer prognosis with increased incidence of heart failure and death. CRP was related to recurrent ischemic events (infarct or recurrent angina, OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.08, p &lt;0.01) and was associated with major cardiac revascularization at 12 months (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.73, p &lt;0.001). TnT demonstrated a mild correlation with recurrent infarct or angina at 12 months (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.22, p &lt;0.05) but appeared related to multivessel coronary artery disease (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.99, p &lt;0.01). In conclusion, BNP appears to be associated with a long-term increased risk of mortality and heart failure in patients with apparently mild risk. BNP is also associated with a larger extent and greater severity of myocardial ischemia. Early BNP measurement could provide incremental information to TnT and CRP, and it may be the strongest independent predictor of cardiac outcome in subjects without left ventricular dysfunction or enlargement.",M1
17114408,"Regulation of troponin T expression during muscle development in sea bream Sparus auratus Linnaeus: the potential role of thyroid hormones.In the sea bream Sparus auratus three stage-specific fast troponin T (fTnT) isoforms have been cloned and correspond to embryonic-, larval- and adult-specific isoforms. Characterisation, using database searches, of the putative genomic organisation of Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis fTnT indicates that alternative exon splicing in the 5 region of the gene generates the different isoforms. Moreover, comparison of teleost fTnTs suggests that alternative splicing of fTnT appears to be common in teleosts. A different temporal expression pattern for each fTnT splice varotnt is found during sea bream development and probably relates to differing functional demands, as a highly acidic embryonic form (pI 5.16) is substituted by a basic larval form (pI 9.57). Thyroid hormones (THs), which play an important regulatory role in muscle development in flatfish and tetrapods, appear also to influence <e>TnT</e> gene expression in the sea bream. However, THs have a divergent action on different sea bream TnT genes and although the slow isoform (sTnT1) is TH-responsive, fTnT, sTnT2 and the itronless isoform (iTnT) are unaffected. The present results taken together with those published for flatfish seem to suggest differences may exist in the regulation of larval muscle development in teleosts.",M1
17095922,"Calcium sensitivity of human single muscle fibers following plyometric training.PURPOSE: To study the effect of plyometric training on Ca2+ sensitivity and the influence of troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) isoforms on Ca2+ -activation properties in skinned human muscle fibers. METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of eight men before and after the training period. Chemically skinned fibers were evaluated regarding their Ca2+ -activation properties and were classified according to their myosin heavy chain (MHC) contents and analyzed regarding their slow and fast TnT isoforms. RESULTS: After training, significant improvements (P &lt; 0.05) were found for static jump, countermovement jump, 6 x 5-m shuttle-run test, and leg-press performances. An 8% increase in the proportion of type IIa fibers (P &lt; 0.05) was observed. Single-fiber diameters increased by 11% in type I (P &lt; 0.01), 10% in type IIa (P &lt; 0.001), and 15% in type IIa/IIx fibers (P &lt; 0.001). Peak fiber force increased by 35% in type I (P &lt; 0.001), 25% in type IIa (P &lt; 0.001), and 57% in type IIa/IIx fibers (P &lt; 0.01). The Ca2+ -activation threshold was not altered by training, but the Ca2+ concentration required to elicit half-maximal activation showed a decreasing trend, with significant changes in type I fibers (P &lt; 0.001). Cooperativity at low Ca2+ concentrations was increased in type I and type IIa/IIx fibers (P &lt; 0.05). Type I fibers exclusively expressed slow TnT isoforms, and type II fibers were always associated with fast TnT isoforms, independent of training status. Therefore, changes in Ca2+ sensitivity after training could not be explained by differential fast or slow TnT isoform expression. CONCLUSION: Plyometric training increased single-fiber Ca2+ sensitivity, especially in type I fibers. These changes could not be explained by a modified TnT isoform expression pattern.",M1
17084247,"Isolated elevation in troponin T after percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with higher long-term mortality.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether, in patients with normal post-procedure CK-MB, an isolated elevation in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) predicts long-term survival. BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin T is a sensitive and specific marker of myonecrosis. There is little known about the incidence and prognostic significance of an isolated elevation of cTnT without a rise in creatine kinase (CK)-MB following PCI. METHODS: We evaluated the outcomes of 1,949 patients from the Mayo Clinic registry who had normal pre-procedure cTnT and CK-MB, required nonemergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and had normal CK-MB after the procedure. RESULTS: An elevation in cTnT (cTnT+) was observed in 383 patients (19.6%) (median 0.04 ng/ml, interquartile range 0.03 to 0.06 ng/ml). The <e>TnT</e>+ status was associated with adverse clinical and angiographic characteristics, and multivessel PCI. Over the median follow-up duration of 26 months, mortality (p &lt; 0.001) and the combined rate of death and myocardial infarction (p = 0.004) were significantly higher in cTnT+ patients. Estimated 3-year survival for those with and without cTnT elevation was 86.9% and 93.2%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, an elevation in cTnT after PCI was an independent predictor of increased long-term mortality. A doubling in the post-PCI cTnT was associated with a partial hazard ratio of 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.40; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: An isolated minor elevation in cTnT after PCI provides long-term prognostic information regarding mortality and myocardial infarction.",M1
17074690,"Elevation of myeloperoxidase in conjunction with cardiac-specific markers after marathon running.Cardiac-related death has been reported following strenuous exercise, and biochemical markers predicting adverse outcomes would be useful. Despite the fact the myeloperoxidase (MPO) release may precede myocardial injury and identify at-risk patients earlier than traditional markers, information on the effects of marathon running on MPO levels is lacking. We measured MPO in conjunction with the creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB), myoglobin, troponin T (<e>TnT</e>), and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in 24 athletes before and after a marathon race. Of the 24 athletes, 22 (92%) had an increased MPO level, and the mean MPO level increased from 281.44 pmol/L to 785.21 pmol/L (P &lt; .0001). Results for 14 (58%) of the athletes reached or exceeded the manufacturer's recommended clinical threshold. The increases in CK-MB, myoglobin, TnT, and NT-proBNP also reached statistical significance. Although the elevation in MPO most likely represents a systemic inflammatory response, the concurrent elevations in TnT and NT-proBNP suggest that myocardial injury cannot be excluded.",M1
17063360,"Altered tension cost in (TG(mREN-2)27) rats overexpressing the mouse renin gene.The present study aimed to characterize cardiac hypertrophy induced by activation of the renin-angiotensin system in terms of functional alterations on the level of the contractile proteins, employing transgenic rats harboring the mouse renin gene (TGR(mREN2)27). Ca2+-dependent tension and myosin ATPase activity were measured in skinned fiber preparations obtained from TGR(mREN2)27 and from age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats (SPDR). Western blots for troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) were performed and the phosphorylation status of TnI were evaluated in myocardial preparations. TnT and myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms were analyzed by RT-PCR. The pCa/tension relationship was shifted to the right in TGR(mREN2)27 compared to SPDR as indicated by increased Ca2+-concentrations required for half maximal activation of tension (SPDR 5.80, 95% confidence limits 5.77-5.82 vs. TGR(mREN2)27 5.69, 95% confidence limits 5.67-5.72, pCa units), while maximal developed tension was unaltered. Even more pronounced was the shift in the relationship between pCa and myosin-ATPase (SPDR 6.01, 95% confidence limits 5.99-6.03 vs. TGR(mREN2)27 5.77, 95% confidence limits 5.73-5.79, pCa units). The maximal myosin-ATPase activity was reduced in TGR(mREN2)27 compared to SPDR, respectively (211.0 +/- 28.77 micromol ADP/s vs. 271.6 +/- 43.66 micromol ADP/s, P &lt; 0.05). Tension cost (ATPase activity/tension) was significantly reduced in TGR(mREN2)27. The beta-MHC expression was significantly increased in TGR(mREN2)27. There was no isoform shift for TnT (protein and mRNA), as well as TnI, and no alteration of the phosphorylation of TnI in TGR(mREN2)27 compared to SPRD. The present study demonstrates that cardiac hypertrophy, induced by an activation of the renin-angiotensin system, leads to adapting alterations on the level of the contractile filaments, which reduce tension cost.",M1
17062956,"Difference in elevation of N-terminal pro-BNP and conventional cardiac markers between patients with ST elevation vs non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome.BACKGROUND: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is elevated in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and is a powerful predictor of long-term mortality. Differences in the clinical utility and pathophysiological implication of NT-proBNP and conventional cardiac markers in patients with ST elevation (STE) vs non-STE (NSTE) ACS were investigated in the present study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety consecutive patients admitted with acute chest pain and a diagnosis of unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction were analyzed. Patients with &gt;or=Killip class II were excluded to focus on the effect of myocardial ischemia on the release of cardiac markers. The markers were measured on admission and analyzed according to the time from onset. Conventional cytosolic marker (creatine kinase-MB) and myofibril marker (troponin T: <e>TnT</e>) were both significantly higher in STE-ACS patients compared with NSTE-ACS patients. Conversely, NT-proBNP was significantly higher in NSTE-ACS patients than STE-ACS especially within 3 h of onset, suggesting a larger ischemic insult despite the smaller extent of myocardial necrosis compared with STE-ACS patients. There was no significant correlation between NT-proBNP level and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained at acute-phase echocardiography in either NSTE-ACS patients (LVEF 57.7+/-11.2%) or STE-ACS patients (LVEF 55.1+/-12.7%). Comparison between NT-proBNP and TnT levels revealed a marked difference of elevations, with significantly augmented elevation of NT-proBNP (p&lt;0.001) in NSTE-ACS patients as compared with prominent elevation of TnT in STE-ACS patients. CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP is an early sensitive marker of myocardial ischemia that rises much higher in the earlier phase as compared with conventional markers of myocardial damage, especially in NSTE-ACS patients.",M1
16989795,"An SPR immunosensor for human cardiac troponin T using specific binding avidin to biotin at carboxymethyldextran-modified gold chip.BACKGROUND: The cardiac troponin T (<e>TnT</e>) is a cardiospecific, highly sensitive marker for myocardial damage and is immediately released to bloodstream during the acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor was developed for the quick detection of human cTnT in real time. METHODS: An SPR sensor streptavidin terminated self-assembled monolayer, which was used to binding biotinylated anti troponin T monoclonal antibodies, was developed. RESULTS: The cTnT was determined from successive injections with a linear range from 0.03 up to 6.5 ng/ml. The detection limit was 0.01 ng/ml corresponding to a resonant angle change of 1.28 millidegrees. The system presented a good repeatability with 3.4% of variation between run after regeneration of the coated surface with a solution of 1% SDS. The effects of blocking of non-specific adsorption using different solutions were studied. It was possible to measure the cTnT without dilution of the human serum with good specificity and reproducibility. CONCLUSION: This sensor is practical and offer quick response in interval of 800 s.",M1
20349542,"Geometry-independent neutral desorption device for the sensitive EESI-MS  detection of explosives on various surfaces.A novel geometry-independent neutral desorption (GIND) device was successfully developed, which made neutral desorption (ND) sampling easier and more robust on virtually all types of surfaces. The GIND device features a small air-tight enclosure with fixed space between the ND gas emitter, the sample surface, and the sample collector. Besides easy fabrication and convenient use, this configuration facilitates efficient neutral sample transfer and results in high sensitivity by preventing material loss during the ND process. The effects of various operating parameters of the GIND device such as desorption gas composition, surface wetness, gas flow rate, distance between the surface and the gas emitter, internal diameter of the sample outlet, and GIND device material were experimentally investigated. By using the GIND device, trace amounts of typical explosives such as <e>TNT</e>, RDX, HMX, TATP, etc., were successfully sampled from many different kinds of surfaces, including human skin, glove, glass, envelope, plastic, leather, glass, and clothes. GIND-sampled explosives were detected by multiple-stage extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EESI-MS). Ion/molecule reactions of explosives such as RDX and TATP were implemented in the EESI source for the rapid detection with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. The typical time for a single sample analysis was a few seconds. Successful transportation of the neutral analytes over a distance longer than 10 m was demonstrated, without either significant signal loss or serious delay of signal response. The limit of detection for these explosives in the study was in the range of ca. 59-842 fg (S/N = 3, n = 8) on various surfaces. Acceptable relative standard deviation (RSD) values (ca. 4.6-10.2%, n = 8) were obtained for all the surfaces tested, showing the successful sampling of trace non-volatile explosive compounds (sub-picogram) by the GIND device for the EESI mass spectrometric analysis.",M2
20347218,"Application of advanced oxidation processes for <e>TNT</e> removal: A review.Nowadays, there are increasingly stringent regulations requiring drastic treatment of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) contaminated waters to generate treated waters which could be easily reused or released into the environment without any harmful effects. TNT is among the most highly suspected explosive compounds that interfere with groundwater system due to its high toxicity and low biodegradability. The present work is an overview of the literature on TNT removal from polluted waters and soils and, more particularly, its treatability by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Among the remediation technologies, AOPs constitute a promising technology for the treatment of wastewaters containing non-easily biodegradable organic compounds. Data concerning the degradation of TNT reported during the period 1990-2009 are evaluated in this review. Among the AOPs, the following techniques are successively debated: processes based on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)+UV, Fenton, photo-Fenton and Fenton-like processes), photocatalysis, processes based on ozone (O(3), O(3)+UV) and electrochemical processes. Kinetic constants related to TNT degradation and the different mechanistic degradation pathways are discussed. Possible future treatment strategies, such as, coupling AOP with biological treatment is also considered as a mean to improve TNT remediation efficiency and kinetic.",M2
20226494,"Abiotic transformation of high explosives by freshly precipitated iron minerals in aqueous FeII solutions.Zerovalent iron barriers have become a viable treatment for field-scale cleanup of various ground water contaminants. While contact with the iron surface is important for contaminant destruction, the interstitial pore water within and near the iron barrier will be laden with aqueous, adsorbed and precipitated Fe(II) phases. These freshly precipitated iron minerals could play an important role in transforming high explosives (HE). Our objective was to determine the transformation of RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine), and <e>TNT</e> (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) by freshly precipitated iron Fe(II)/Fe(III) minerals. This was accomplished by quantifying the effects of initial Fe(II) concentration, pH, and the presence of aquifer solids (Fe(III) phases) on HE transformation rates. Results showed that at pH 8.2, freshly precipitated iron minerals transformed RDX, HMX, and TNT with reaction rates increasing with increasing Fe(II) concentrations. RDX and HMX transformations in these solutions also increased with increasing pH (5.8-8.55). By contrast, TNT transformation was not influenced by pH (6.85-8.55) except at pH values &lt;6.35. Transformations observed via LC/MS included a variety of nitroso products (RDX, HMX) and amino degradation products (TNT). XRD analysis identified green rust and magnetite as the dominant iron solid phases that precipitated from the aqueous Fe(II) during HE treatment under anaerobic conditions. Geochemical modeling also predicted Fe(II) activity would likely be controlled by green rust and magnetite. These results illustrate the important role freshly precipitated Fe(II)/Fe(III) minerals in aqueous Fe(II) solutions play in the transformation of high explosives.",M2
20222703,"Conjugated polymer-titania nanoparticle hybrid films: random lasing action and ultrasensitive detection of explosive vapors.We have first demonstrated that a random laser action generated by a hybrid film composed of a semiconducting organic polymer (SOP) and TiO(2) nanoparticles can be used to detect 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) vapors. The hybrid film was fabricated by spin-casting SOP solution dispersed with nanosized TiO(2) particles on quartz glass. The SOP in the hybrid film functioned as both the gain medium and the sensory transducer. A random lasing action was observed with a certain pump power when the size (diameter of 50 nm) and concentration (8.9 x 10(12)/cm(3)) of TiO(2) nanoparticles were optimized. Measurements of fluorescence quenching behavior of the hybrid film in TNT vapor atmosphere (10 ppb) showed that attenuated lasing in optically pumped hybrid film displayed a sensitivity to vapors of explosives more than 20 times higher than was observed from spontaneous emission. This phenomenon has been explained with the four-level laser model. Since the sensory transducer used in the hybrid polymer/nanoparticles system could be replaced by other functional materials, the concept developed could be extended to more general domains of chemical or environment detection.",M2
20205382,"Dynamic planar solid phase microextraction-ion mobility spectrometry for rapid field air sampling and analysis of illicit drugs and explosives.A preconcentration device that targets the volatile chemical signatures associated with illicit drugs and explosives (high and low) has been designed to fit in the inlet of an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). This is the first reporting of a fast and sensitive method for dynamic sampling of large volumes of air using planar solid phase microextraction (PSPME) incorporating a high surface area for absorption of analytes onto a sol-gel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating for direct thermal desorption into an IMS. This device affords high extraction efficiencies due to strong retention properties at ambient temperature, resulting in the detection of analyte concentrations in the parts per trillion range when as low as 3.5 L of air are sampled over the course of 10 s (absolute mass detection of less than a nanogram). Dynamic PSPME was used to sample the headspace over the following: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) tablets resulting in the detection of 12-40 ng of piperonal, high explosives (Pentolite) resulting in the detection of 0.6 ng of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>), and low explosives (several smokeless powders) resulting in the detection of 26-35 ng of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 11-74 ng of diphenylamine (DPA).",M2
20203361,"L-cysteine-capped CdTe QD-based sensor for simple and selective detection of trinitrotoluene.Trinitrotoluene, usually known as <e>TNT</e>, is a kind of chemical explosive with hazardous and toxic effects on the environment and human health. National and societal security concerns have dictated an increasing need for the analytical detection of TNT with rapidity, high sensitivity and low cost. This work demonstrates a novel method using L-cysteine-capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) to assay TNT, based on the formation of a Meisenheimer complex between TNT and cysteine. The fluorescence (FL) of quantum dots quench because electrons of the QDs transfer to the TNT molecules via the formation of a Meisenheimer complex. TNT can be detected with a low detection limit of 1.1 nM. Studies on the selectivity of this method show that only TNT can generate an intense signal response. The synthesized QDs are excellent nanomaterials for TNT detection. In addition, TNT in soil samples is also analyzed by the proposed method.",M2
20185159,"Influence of pH on 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene degradation by Yarrowia lipolytica.The microbial reduction of the aromatic ring of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) can lead to its complete destruction. The acid-tolerant yeast Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15 transformed TNT through hydride ion-mediated reduction of the aromatic ring (as the main pathway), resulting in the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate ions, as well as through nitro group reduction (as minor pathway), resulting in hydroxylamino- and aminoaromatics. TNT transformation depended on the yeasts' ability to acidify the culture medium through the production of organic acids. Aeration and a low medium buffer capacity favored yeast growth and resulted in rapid acidification of the medium, which influenced the rate and extent of TNT transformation. This is the first time that nitrate has been detected as a major product of microbial TNT degradation, and this work demonstrates the importance of pH on TNT biotransformation. The ability of Y. lipolytica AN-L15 to reduce the TNT aromatic ring to form TNT-hydride complexes, followed by their denitration, makes this strain a potential candidate for bioremediation of sites contaminated with explosives.",M2
20152259,"Micellar extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-ultra violet determination of some explosives in water samples.An analytical method based on the cloud point extraction combined with high performance liquid chromatography is used for the extraction, separation and determination of four explosives; octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazine (HMX), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). These compounds are extracted by using of Triton X-114 and cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). After extraction, the samples were analyzed using a HPLC-UV system. The parameters affecting extraction efficiency (such as Triton X-114 and CTAB concentrations, amount of Na(2)SO(4), temperature, incubation and centrifuge times) were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the preconcentration factor was 40 and the improvement factors of 34, 29, 61 and 42 with detection limits of 0.09, 0.14, 0.08 and 0.40 (microg L(-1)) were obtained for HMX, RDX, TNT and PETN, respectively.

20151433,"A reversible dual-response fluorescence switch for the detection of multiple analytes.This paper reports a reversible dual fluorescence switch for the detection of a proton target and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) with opposite-response results, based on fluorophore derivatization of silica nanoparticles. Fluorescent silica nanoparticles were synthesized through modification of the surface with a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore and an organic amine to form a hybrid monolayer of fluorophores and amino ligands; the resultant nanoparticles showed different fluorescence responses to the proton target and TNT. Protonation of the amino ligands leads to fluorescence enhancement due to inhibition of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the amine and fluorophore. By contrast, addition of TNT results in fluorescence quenching because a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) happens between the NBD fluorophore and the formed TNT-amine complex. The fluorescence signal is reversible through washing with the proper solvents and the nanoparticles can be reused after centrifugal separation. Furthermore, these nanoparticles were assembled into chips on an etched silicon wafer for the detection of TNT and the proton target. The assembled chip can be used as a convenient indicator of herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and TNT residues with the use of only 10 microL of sample. The simple NBD-grafted silica nanoparticles reported here show a reversible signal and good assembly flexibility; thus, they can be applied in multianalyte detection.",M2
20145878,"Coupling indigenous biostimulation and phytoremediation for the restoration of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene-contaminated sites.In-situ bioremediation has been highly promising in degrading nitroaromatics in soil, e.g., 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>). The case of TNT is examined here as a representative nitroaromatic compound that belongs to a suite of explosive residue types scattered throughout the European Union and other areas of the world. Differences in cost-effectiveness and TNT degradation rates between existing methods have spurred extensive debate in bioremediation research of explosive-contaminated sites. Rhizoremediation (plant inoculation with a specific microorganism), including genetic modification of plant/tree species, has been treated as the next best remediation method due to excellent performance in the lab. However, recent data collected in the field do not support the initial enthusiasm, showing in many cases, no statistical difference between (non-)transgenic rhizoremediation and phytoremediation (use of wild plant types). Obviously, the role of indigenous rhizospheric microorganisms has been underestimated, impeding our progress towards identifying the critical components of the optimum bioremediation scheme. Future research directions to enhance the indigenous microbial activity in the plant rhizosphere via addition of chemical amendments, such as, nutrients (fertilizers), and/or chaotropic agents (urea) could improve the overall efficiency of existing phytoremediation schemes.",M2

The challenges involved in such system integration are discussed. A hydrogel-coated screen-printed electrode is used for the detection of the thermally desorbed TNT from a preconcentration device using rapid square wave voltammetry. Optimization of the preconcentration system for desorption of TNT and subsequent electrochemical detection was conducted yielding a desorption temperature of 120 degrees C under a flow rate of 500 mL min(-1). Such conditions resulted in a characteristic electrochemical signal for TNT representing the multi-step reduction process. Quantitative measurements produced a linear signal dependence on TNT quantity exposed to the preconcentrator from 0.25 to 10 microg. Finally, the integrated device was successfully demonstrated using a sample of solid TNT located upstream of the preconcentrator.",M2

20038158,"Biomimetic chemosensor: designing peptide recognition elements for surface functionalization of carbon nanotube field effect transistors.Single-wall carbon nanotube field effect transistors (SWNT-FETs) are ideal candidates for fabricating sensors due to their unique electronic properties and have been widely investigated for chemical and biological sensing applications. The lack of selectivity of SWNT-FETs has prompted extensive research on developing ligands that exhibit specific binding as selective surface coating for SWNTs. Herein we describe the rational design of a peptide recognition element (PRE) that is capable of noncovalently attaching to SWNTs as well as binding to trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>). The PRE contains two domains, a TNT binding domain derived from the binding pocket of the honeybee odor binding protein ASP1, and a SWNT binding domain previously identified from the phage peptide display library. The PRE structure in the presence of SWNT was investigated by performing classical all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Both computational and experimental analyses demonstrate that the peptide retains two functional domains for SWNT and TNT binding. The binding motif of the peptide to SWNT and to TNT was revealed from interaction energy calculations by molecular dynamics simulations. The potential application of the peptide for the detection of TNT is theoretically predicted and experimentally validated using a SWNT-FET sensor functionalized with a designer PRE. Results from this study demonstrate the creation of chemosensors using designed PRE as selective surface coatings for targeted analytes.",M2

19921512,"Development of a chemiluminescent ELISA and a colloidal gold-based LFIA for <e>TNT</e> detection.To identify the explosive used in a terrorist attack, or to obtain an early sign of environmental pollution it is important to use simple and rapid assays able to detect analytes at low levels, possibly on-site. This is particularly true for TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), one of the most employed explosives in the 20th century and at the same time, because of its toxicity, a well known pollutant. In this work we describe the development of an indirect competitive ELISA with chemiluminescent detection (CL-ELISA) and of a lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on colloidal gold nanoparticle labels. A commercially available monoclonal antibody was used and 13 specially synthesized conjugates were tested. We optimized the assay by determining the optimal concentration of monoclonal antibody and conjugates and the influence of various non-specific factors such as: tolerance to organic solvents at different concentrations, the washing and competitive step time, and the cross-reactivity with related compounds. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the CL-ELISA were good (LOD and IC(50) values in the ng mL(-1) range, and CV value about 7%). It has been applied to real samples of various materials involved in a controlled explosion of an  improvised explosive device .

19892541,"A new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based electrochemical sensor for monitoring 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) in natural waters and soil samples.A high selective voltammetric sensor for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was introduced. TNT selective MIP and non-imprinted polymer (NIP) were synthesized and then used for carbon paste (CP) electrode preparation. The MIP, incorporated in the carbon paste electrode, functioned as selectively recognition element and pre-concentrator agent for TNT determination. The prepared electrode was used for TNT measurement by the three steps procedure, including analyte extraction in the electrode, electrode washing and electrochemical measurement of TNT. The MIP-CP electrode showed very high recognition ability in comparison to NIP-CP. It was shown that electrode washing after TNT extraction led to enhanced selectivity. The response of square wave voltammetry for TNT determination by proposed electrode was higher than that of differential pulse voltammetry. Some parameters affecting sensor response were optimized and then a calibration curve plotted. A dynamic linear range of 5x10(-9) to 1x10(-6) mol l(-1) was obtained. The detection limit of the sensor was calculated equal to 1.5x10(-9) mol l(-1). This sensor was used successfully for TNT determination in different water and soil samples.",M2
19875785,"Investigating the fate of nitroaromatic (<e>TNT</e>) and nitramine (RDX and HMX) explosives in fractured and pristine soils.Explosives compounds, known toxins, are loaded to soils on military training ranges predominantly during explosives detonation events that likely fracture soil particles. This study was conducted to investigate the fate of explosives compounds in aqueous slurries containing fractured and pristine soil particles. Three soils were crushed with a piston to emulate detonation-induced fracturing. X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, gas adsorption surface area measurements, and scanning electron microscopy were used to quantify and image pristine and fractured soil particles. Aqueous batches were prepared by spiking soils with solutions containing 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), octahydro 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). Samples were collected over 92 d and the concentrations of the spiked explosives compounds and TNT transformation products 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT) were measured. Our results suggest soil mineralogical and geochemical compositions were not changed during piston-induced fracturing but morphological differences were evident with fractured soils exhibiting more angular surfaces, more fine grained particles, and some microfracturing that is not visible in the pristine samples. TNT, 2,4-DNT, RDX, and HMX exhibited greater analyte loss over time in batch solutions containing fractured soil particles compared to their pristine counterparts. 2ADNT and 4ADNT exhibited greater concentrations in slurries containing pristine soils than in slurries containing fractured soils. Explosives compound transformation is greater in the presence of fractured soil particles than in the presence of pristine soil particles. Our results imply fractured soil particles promote explosive compound transformation and/or explosives compounds have a greater affinity for adsorption to fractured soil particle surfaces.",M2
19851725,"Nitroreductase II involved in 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene degradation: purification and characterization from Klebsiella sp. Cl.Three 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) nitroreductases from Klebsiella sp. CI have different reduction capabilities that can degrade TNT by simultaneous utilization of two initial reduction pathways. Of these, nitroreductase II was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatographies. Nitroreductase II is an oxygen-insensitive enzyme and reduces both TNT and nitroblue tetrazolium. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme did not show any sequence similarity with those of other nitroreductases reported. However, it transformed TNT by the reduction of nitro groups like nitroreductase I. It had a higher substrate affinity and specific activity for TNT reduction than other nitroreductases, and it showed a higher oxidation rate of NADPH with the ortho-substituted isomers of TNT metabolites (2-hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene and 2-aminodinitrotoluene) than with para-substituted compounds (4-hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene and 4-amino-dinitrotoluene).",M2
19846196,"Outdoor weathering and dissolution of <e>TNT</e> and Tritonal.Low-order detonations of military munitions scatter cm-sized chunks of high-explosives onto military range soils, where rainfall can dissolve and then transport the explosives to groundwater. We present 1 year of mass-loss data obtained from cm-sized chunks of the frequently used explosives TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and Tritonal (an 80:20 mixture of TNT and aluminum flakes) exposed outdoors to weather and dissolve under natural conditions. The explosive chunks rested on glass frits in individual funnels and all precipitation interacting with them was collected and analyzed. Mass balance data reveal that TNT in the water samples accounts for only about one-third of the TNT lost from the chunks. The creation of photo-transformation products on the solid chunks, and their subsequent dissolution or sublimation, probably accounts for the other two-thirds. Although these products cannot, as yet, be quantified they are intrinsic to the outdoor weathering and fate of TNT-based explosives. TNT in our water samples was not photo-transformed. Thus, we used the yearlong, dissolved-mass time-series to validate a drop-impingement dissolution model for TNT. The model used measured rainfall and air temperature data as input, and the results agreed remarkably well with TNT dissolved-mass time-series measured for the year. This model can estimate annual TNT influx into range soils using annual rainfall and particle-size distributions. Nevertheless, large uncertainties remain in the numbers and sizes of TNT particles scattered on military ranges and the identities and fates of the photo-transformation products.",M2
19815337,"Dissolution of a new explosive formulation containing <e>TNT</e> and HMX: comparison with octol.GIM (Greener Insensitive Material) is a new explosive formulation made of HMX (51.5%), TNT (40.7%), and a binder, ETPE (7.8%), which is currently investigated by the Canadian Department of National Defense for a wider use by the Army. In the present study, dissolution of GIM in water was measured and compared to the dissolution of octol (HMX/TNT: 70/30). Although the presence of ETPE did not prevent completely TNT and HMX from dissolving, GIM appeared to dissolve more slowly than octol. The ETPE was shown to prevent the formulation particles from collapsing and to retard the dissolution of both TNT and HMX by limiting their exposure to water. In both octol and GIM, the dissolution rate of the particles was governed by the compound(s) that are slower to dissolve, i.e. HMX in octol, and HMX and ETPE in GIM. A model based on Fick's diffusion law allowed fitting well the dissolution data of octol but was less appropriate to fit the data of GIM likely due to a physical rearrangement of the solid upon dissolution. The present findings demonstrate that ETPE in GIM decreases the risks of explosives leakage from particles of the new formulation and should facilitate the collecting of non-exploded GIM particles in training sites.",M2

Use of this technique is relatively new to research in the field of plant science, and the potential for enhancing visualization and understanding of plant uptake and transport of xenobiotics remains largely untapped. Phosphor imager autoradiography is used to investigate the uptake and translocation of the explosives 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene within Populus deltoides x nigra DN34 (poplar) and Panicum vigratum Alamo (switchgrass). In both plant types, TNT and/or TNT-metabolites remain predominantly in root tissues while RDX and/or RDX-metabolites are readily translocated to leaf tissues.

19756280,"Electron attachment to trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) embedded in He droplets: complete freezing of dissociation intermediates in an extended range of electron energies.Electron attachment to the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) embedded in Helium droplets (TNT@He) generates the non-decomposed complexes (TNT)(n)(-), but no fragment ions in the entire energy range 0-12 eV. This strongly contrasts the behavior of single TNT molecules in the gas phase at ambient temperatures, where electron capture leads to a variety of different fragmentation products via different dissociative electron attachment (DEA) reactions. Single TNT molecules decompose by attachment of an electron at virtually no extra energy reflecting the explosive nature of the compound. The complete freezing of dissociation intermediates in TNT embedded in the droplet is explained by the particular mechanisms of DEA in nitrobenzenes, which is characterized by complex rearrangement processes in the transient negative ion (TNI) prior to decomposition. These mechanisms provide the condition for effective energy withdrawal from the TNI into the dissipative environment thereby completely suppressing its decomposition.",M2
19748732,"Effect of soil organic matter chemistry on sorption of trinitrotoluene and 2,4-dinitrotoluene.The sorption of organic contaminants in soil is mainly attributed to the soil organic matter (SOM) content. However, recent studies have highlighted the fact that it is not the total carbon content of the organic matter, but its chemical structure which have a profound effect on the sorption of organic contaminants. In the present study sorption of two nitroaromatic contaminants viz. trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) was studied in different SOM fractions viz. a commercial humic acid, commercial lignin and humic acid and humin extracted from a compost. (13)C-DP/MAS NMR studies indicated that the structural composition of the organic carbon in different SOM fractions was different. The order of sorption of the nitroaromatics in the different sorbents was: humic acid-commercial&gt;humic acid-compost&gt;humin approximately lignin. Among the aliphatic and aromatic carbon fractions (representing bulk of SOM matrix), adsorption parameter K(f)(1/n) for nitroaromatics sorption correlated well with the aliphatic carbon (r=0.791 for TNT and 0.829 for 2,4-DNT) than the aromatic carbon (r=0.634 for TNT and r=0.616 for 2,4-DNT). However, among carbon containing functional groups, carbonyl carbon showed strong positive correlation with sorption of TNT (r=0.991) and 2,4-DNT (r=0.967) while O-alkyl carbon showed negative correlation (r=0.832 for TNT and r=0.828 for 2,4-DNT). The study indicates that aliphatic domains in the SOM significantly affect the non-specific sorption of both the nitroaromatic contaminants.",M2

Static desorption was carried out in the desorption chamber of SPME-HPLC interface containing mobile phase; methanol:water 43:57 (v/v) with subsequent liquid chromatographic analysis at isocratic flow rate of 1.3 mL/min and detection at 254 nm. A reverse phase amide column (5 microm) was used as a separation medium. The limit of detection (S/N=3) for <e>TNT</e> and Tetryl was found to be 0.35 and 0.54 ng/mL, respectively.

19740509,"Assessing <e>TNT</e> and DNT groundwater contamination by compound-specific isotope analysis and 3H-3He groundwater dating: a case study in Portugal.Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) originating from 50 years of explosives production have heavily contaminated two stacked aquifers in the vicinity of Lisboa, Portugal. To assess if these poly-nitroaromatic compounds (P-NACs) are being degraded in the subsurface, tracer-based groundwater dating techniques combined with compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) were applied. The groundwater residence times were distinctly different in the two aerobic aquifers, as determined by the tritium ((3)H)-(3)He method. In the contaminated zones, the upper aquifer exhibited groundwater ages of 25 years, whereas the lower (presumably confined) aquifer contained hardly any tritium which indicates water ages &gt;55 years. P-NACs-containing waste waters are known to have leaked into the upper, unconfined aquifer. However, P-NACs were present in both aquifers in high concentrations (up to 33000 microg L(-1) TNT), which implies a hydraulic connection, although tritium concentrations and chemical data suggest two separated aquifers. Based on the (3)H-(3)He groundwater dating and the presence of very high P-NAC concentrations, the contamination of the lower aquifer must have happened during the early stage of the explosive production, i.e. &gt;50 years ago. Despite this 'old' contamination, TNT and DNT have not been transformed until to date as is demonstrated by the negligible changes in their carbon isotopic signatures (delta(13)C). Thus, P-NACs are very recalcitrant to degradation at the investigated site. If the aquifers remain aerobic, TNT and DNT are expected to persist in the subsurface for many decades to centuries. The presented approach of assessing time scales of natural attenuation at the field scale by the combination of CSIA and (3)H-(3)He water dating has the potential to be applied to any other groundwater contaminants, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, gasoline components, heterocyclic carbenes, or polyaromatic hydrocarbons.",M2

Accompanying the repeated coating of gelatin at the amine-capped silica particles, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) templates were synchronously imprinted into the formed gelatin shells by the charge-transfer interaction between the electron-deficient aromatic rings of TNT and the electron-rich amino groups of gelatin chains. The effective molecular recognition sites generated at the protein interlayers of gelatin shells of monodisperse silica@gelatin particles, and the rebinding TNT capacities changed nonlinearly with the layer number of imprinted gelatin. Three layers of imprinted gelatin produced the largest imprinting factor of approximately 3.0, which is explained by the covalent assembly mechanism. The imprinting protocol is applicable to a broad range of biomaterials (such as proteins, enzymes, chitosan and biopolymers) for imprinting various molecules in aqueous media. Therefore, these results reported here will open a new window of interest in the exploration of novel molecular recognition systems for application in chemosensors, selective separation, and drug screening and release.",M2
19664798,"Modeling of <e>TNT</e> transport from landmines: numerical approach.The fate and transport of TNT has been studied as part of a research program to develop chemical sensors for detecting landmines. The spatial and temporal concentration profiles of TNT and its degradation products depend primarily on the mobility of the water phase. The fate and transport of TNT released from a mine determine the location of the maximum concentration of chemicals on the surface. Chemical detection on the other hand may also provide such spatial location, but the actual position of the landmine is not necessary under the surface of that point. Although this hypothesis seems logical, it has never been proven. This paper presents numerical simulations in 3D (using LaGriT and FEHM codes developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories) of the fate and transport of TNT released from a landmine under changing environmental conditions (such as rainfall and solar radiation). To assess the numerical techniques, we compare numerical simulations to experimental data previously obtained.",M2

19619888,"Fate and transport of <e>TNT</e>, RDX, and HMX in streambed sediments: Implications for riverbank filtration.Riverbank filtration (RBF) refers to the process of capturing surface water passing through the river-sediment-aquifer system by using a collection technique such as a well or an infiltration gallery. RBF removes nearly all suspended and a large number of dissolved contaminants from the surface water. Therefore, it can function as an effective pretreatment process in drinking-water production. TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), RDX (1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane), and HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane) are three military explosive chemicals that are considered of concern to human health when present in source waters. This study is to evaluate the ability of the filtration media in RBF systems to remove these chemicals. The results from an anoxic batch test showed that all three chemicals will degrade while passing through streambed sediments. The pseudo first-order degradation-rate constants for TNT, RDX, and HMX were measured to be 0.33, 0.055, and 0.033d(-1), respectively. Under aerobic conditions only TNT showed significant degradation. Results from a model RBF system showed that the mobility of the three chemical contaminants in streambed sediments was in the order: HMX&gt;RDX&gt;TNT. The results suggest that RBF is capable of removing TNT and RDX but HMX levels may continue to be of concern-especially when collector wells use laterals running directly beneath the stream or riverbed.",M2
19605548,"The role of oxophytodienoate reductases in the detoxification of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Arabidopsis.The explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) is a significant environmental pollutant that is both toxic and recalcitrant to degradation. Phytoremediation is being increasingly proposed as a viable alternative to conventional remediation technologies to clean up explosives-contaminated sites. Despite the potential of this technology, relatively little is known about the innate enzymology of TNT detoxification in plants. To further elucidate this, we used microarray analysis to identify Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes up-regulated by exposure to TNT and found that the expression of oxophytodienoate reductases (OPRs) increased in response to TNT. The OPRs share similarity with the Old Yellow Enzyme family, bacterial members of which have been shown to transform explosives. The three predominantly expressed forms, OPR1, OPR2, and OPR3, were recombinantly expressed and affinity purified. Subsequent biochemical characterization revealed that all three OPRs are able to transform TNT to yield nitro-reduced TNT derivatives, with OPR1 additionally producing the aromatic ring-reduced products hydride and dihydride Meisenheimer complexes. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OPR1 removed TNT more quickly from liquid culture, produced increased levels of transformation products, and maintained higher fresh weight biomasses than wild-type plants. In contrast, OPR1,2 RNA interference lines removed less TNT, produced fewer transformation products, and had lower biomasses. When grown on solid medium, two of the three OPR1 lines and all of the OPR2-overexpressing lines exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to TNT. These data suggest that, in concert with other detoxification mechanisms, OPRs play a physiological role in xenobiotic detoxification.",M2

The copolypeptide, comprising of glutamic acid (Glu) and lysine (Lys) units, is in situ doped into polyaniline through the protonation of the imine nitrogen atoms of polyaniline by the free carboxylic groups of Glu segments, resulting in the formation of polyaniline nanofibers of emeraldine salt. The free amino groups of Lys segments at the surface of nanofibers provide the receptor sites of TNT through the formation of charge-transfer complex between the electron-rich amino groups and the electron-deficient aromatic rings. Adsorptive stripping voltammetry results demonstrate that the poly(Glu-Lys)-doped nanofibers confined onto glassy carbon electrodes exhibit a remarkable enriching effect and thus sensitive electrochemical response to TNT with a linear dynamic range of 0.5-10 microM and a detection limit down to 100 nM. Moreover, other kinds of nitro compounds show different redox behaviors from TNT at the doped nanofibers, and thus do not interfere with the electrochemical detection of TNT. This study essentially offers a new and simple method for electrochemical detection of ultratrace TNT.",M2
19552943,"Reproductive toxicity of nitroaromatics to the cricket, Acheta domesticus.The effect of <e>TNT</e> (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and its metabolites, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2A-DNT), and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4A-DNT) on cricket (Acheta domesticus) reproduction was evaluated. We previously used crickets to assess the toxicity of a nitramine explosive (RDX) and its metabolites. It is common to find that while much information on the environmental impact of the parent compound is available in the literature, such is often not the case for the degradation metabolites of the parent compound. In some instances, these metabolites are as toxic (or more so) as the parent compound and we hypothesized that this might be the case for TNT. The presence of TNT and its metabolites in sand (10 microg/g) did not adversely affect cricket egg production, but adversely affected hatching of cricket eggs as compared to controls. However, there were no differences in hatching success among TNT and metabolite treatment groups. Hatching success of cricket eggs in soil or following topical exposure decreased as concentrations of TNT and its metabolites increased. The relative toxicity of TNT and its metabolites in soil generally followed the trend of TNT&lt;2A-DNT&lt;4A-DNT&lt;2,4-DNT. In addition, toxicity appeared to be higher in sand than in sandy loam soil or in the topical exposure test. After 45 days of exposure in sandy loam soil, the EC(20) (20% effect concentration), EC(50) (50% effect concentration), and EC(95) (95% effect concentration) were 14, 116, and 10,837 microg/g for TNT: 1.7, 32, and 16,711 microg/g for 2A-DNT: 1.9, 9, and 296 microg/g for 4A-DNT: and 0.4, 5.7, and 1437 microg/g for 2,4-DNT. Overall, results suggest that parent TNT and metabolites are toxic to cricket eggs at relatively high concentrations and these toxic effects are manifested as a decrease in hatching success.",M2

Genome shuffling of S. maltophilia OK-5 was used to achieve a rapid enhancement of TNT degradation. The initial mutant population was generated by NTG treatment and UV irradiation. The wild-type OK-5 strain was able to degrade 0.2 mM TNT within 6 days, yet barely tolerated 0.5 mM TNT while the shuffled OK-5 mt-3 was capable of completely degrading 0.5 mM TNT within 8 days, and 1.2 mM within 24 days. The proteomic analysis of the shuffled OK-5 mt-3 demonstrated the changes in the expression levels of certain proteins compared to wild-type OK-5. These results provide clues for understanding TNT tolerance and improved TNT degradation by shuffled S. maltophilia OK-5 mt-3 and have possible applications in the processing of industrial waste containing relatively high TNT concentrations.",M2

Microarray analysis was conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana that were grown in Murashige and Skoog media containing steady-state levels of 0.5 mM RDX or 2.0 microM TNT to study the effect of these compounds on its transcriptional profile. Our results for both RDX and TNT were consistent with the existing theory for xenobiotic metabolism in plants. Among the genes that were differentially expressed included oxidoreductases, cytochrome P450s, transferases, transporters, and several unknown expressed proteins. We discuss the potential role of upregulated genes in plant metabolism, phytoremediation, and phytosensing. Phytosensing, the detection of field contamination using plants, is an end goal of this project.",M2

19476386,"Polymer-oligopeptide composite coating for selective detection of explosives in water.The selective detection of a specific target molecule in a complex environment containing potential contaminants presents a significant challenge in chemical sensor development. Utilizing phage display techniques against trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) targets, peptide receptors have previously been identified with selective binding capabilities for these molecules. For practical applications, these receptors must be immobilized onto the surface of sensor platforms at high density while maintaining their ability to bind target molecules. In this paper, a polymeric matrix composed of poly(ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PEGM) has been prepared. A high density of receptors was covalently linked through reaction of amino groups present in the receptor with epoxy groups present in the co-polymer. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas-chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), this attachment strategy is demonstrated to lead to stably bound receptors, which maintain their selective binding ability for TNT. The TNT receptor/PEGM conjugates retained 10-fold higher TNT binding ability in liquid compared to the lone PEGM surface and 3-fold higher TNT binding compared to non-specific receptor conjugates. In contrast, non-target DNT exposure yielded undetectable levels of binding. These results indicate that this polymeric construct is an effective means of facilitating selective target interaction both in an aqueous environment. Finally, real-time detection experiments were performed using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as the sensing platform. Selective detection of TNT vs DNT was demonstrated using QCM crystals coated with PEGM/TNT receptor, highlighting that this receptor coating can be incorporated as a sensing element in a standard detection device for practical applications.",M2

19427119,"Sonochemical decomposition of dinitrotoluenes and trinitrotoluene in wastewater.Mineralization of dinitrotoluenes (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) in wastewater was conducted under ultrasonic irradiation. The batch-wise experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the sonolytic behavior, including power intensity, acidity of wastewater, reaction temperature and oxygen dosage. It is remarkable that the nitrotoluenes contained could be almost completely decomposed by the sonochemical oxidation method, wherein the pyrolytic reaction was responsible for the destruction of organic compounds. During the sonication tests, the influence of reaction temperature on the degradation of nitrotoluenes is the most significant, followed by power intensity, acidity of wastewater and oxygen dosage. Based on the spectra obtained from gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), it is suggested that 2,4,6-TNT is preliminarily denitrated to 2,6-DNT. The denitration of 2,6-DNT and/or 2,4-DNT results in the formation of o-mononitrotoluene, which proceeds with the cleavage of nitro group into toluene, followed by oxidation of methyl group and decarboxylation. In this study, it is believed that the sonolytic technique established is promising for wastewater disposal in toluene nitration processes.",M2

HK-6 in two types of media.TNT-induced cellular responses and proteomes in Pseudomonas sp. HK-6 were comparatively analyzed in two different media: basal salts (BS) and Luria broth (LB). HK-6 cells could not degrade more than 0.5 mM TNT with BS medium, while in LB medium, they exhibited the enhanced capability to degrade as much as 3.0 mM TNT. Analysis of total cellular fatty acids in HK-6 cells suggested that the relative abundance of several saturated or unsaturated fatty acids is altered under TNT-mediated stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of perforations, irregular rod formations, and wrinkled extracellular surfaces in cells under TNT stress. Proteomic analysis of soluble protein fractions from HK-6 cultures grown with TNT as a substrate revealed 11 protein spots induced by TNT. Among these, seven proteins (including Alg8, AlgB, NirB, and the AhpC/Tsa family) were detected only in LB medium containing TNT. The proteins AspS, Tsf, and assimilatory nitrate reductase were increasingly expressed only in BS medium containing TNT. The protein dGTPase was found to be induced and expressed when cells were grown in either type of TNT-containing media. These results provide a better understanding of the cytotoxicity and survival mechanism used by Pseudomonas sp. HK-6 when placed under TNT stress conditions.",M2

The results of the optimization study indicate that the most efficient condition for reducing the concentration of TNT also generates sufficient amounts of iron(II)for the subsequent oxidative treatment through the Fenton reaction. In general, it was observed that the treatment was highly efficient in terms of meeting the main associated environmental parameters, since it reduced acute toxicity, removed 100% of TNT, 100% of the organic nitrogen and 95.4% of the COD.",M2
19368206,"Denitration of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in aqueous solutions using small-molecular-weight catalyst(s) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ESA-5.The denitration of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) can produce mono- or dinitro aromatic compounds susceptible to microbial mineralization. In the present study, denitration of TNT and other nitro aromatic compounds was investigated with a solid-phase extract obtained from the culture supernatant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ESA-5 grown on a chemically defined aerobic medium. When the C18 solid-phase extract containing extracellular catalysts (EC) was incubated with TNT and NAD(P)H, we observed a significant release of nitrite. The concentration of nitrite released in the reaction medium was strongly dependent on the concentration of NAD(P)H and EC. Denitration also occurred with two TNT-related molecules, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzaldehyde, and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzyl alcohol. The release of nitrite was coupled with the formation of two polar metabolites, and mass spectrometry analyses indicated that each of these compounds had lost two nitro groups from the trinitro aromatic parent molecule. During this process, the production of toxic reduced TNT metabolites was minimal. The incubation of EC with TNT, NAD(P)H, and specific scavengers of reactive oxygen species suggested the involvement of superoxide radicals (O2*-) and hydrogen peroxide in the denitration process. Results obtained in this study reveal for the first time that extracellular small-molecular-weight substance(s) of bacterial origin can serve as green catalyst(s) to initiate TNT denitration. In addition, this study gives clear evidence for the production of a TNT metabolite bearing a single nitro groupfollowing a denitration reaction with catalyst(s) of biotic origin.",M2
19303701,"Adsorption mechanism and property of a novel adsorption material PAM/SiO2 towards 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) is toxic and mutagenic to many living organisms, so more and more rigorous limits on the letting amount of TNT have been established. In this paper, functional monomer acrylamide (AM) was grafted step by step on the surface of silica gel particles, and the grafted particle PAM/SiO(2) with strong adsorption ability for TNT was formed. The adsorption mechanism and properties of PAM/SiO(2) for TNT were researched through static and dynamic methods. The experimental results showed that PAM/SiO(2) possesses strong adsorption ability for TNT with interaction of three kinds of hydrogen bonds including peculiar NHcdots, three dots, centeredpi hydrogen bond (aromatic hydrogen bond) and CHcdots, three dots, centeredOC pi hydrogen bond. The saturated adsorption amount could reach to 0.873 mg g(-1). The empirical Freundlich isotherm was found to describe well the equilibrium adsorption data. In addition, the pH and temperature were found to have great influence on the adsorption amount. Mixture solution of HCl and ethanol is used as eluent, and the adsorbed TNT is eluted easily from PAM/SiO(2). Finally, PAM/SiO(2) was found to have excellent reusability.",M2
19299173,"<e>TNT</e> detection with 14N NQR: multipulse sequences and matched filter.Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) has a distinct potential to verify the presence of nitrogen bearing substances based on the unequivocal signatures of their spectra. Therefore, this technique is especially suitable for remote detection of illicit substances and explosives. Unfortunately, the inherent signal-to-noise of the most abundant explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT) is very low. Here we present an NQR method with improved sensitivity for estimation of the probability of TNT presence in the investigated object. The method consists of a spin-lock spin-echo (SLSE) multipulse sequence for signal excitation and a time domain matched filter for signal detection. We find that the signal-to-noise increases by shortening the pulse spacings, even though this means a decrease in spectral resolution. In our case, the decrease of the pulse spacings from the typical 2 ms to 540 micros resulted in an increase of the signal-to-noise by 14 dB. A theory describing this enhancement is presented and compared to experimental results on TNT. Issues related to temperature and polymorphism variations are also discussed.",M2

Despite the presence of spectral bands arising from the natural and synthetic polymers and dyed textiles, the explosive substances could be identified by their characteristic Raman bands. Furthermore, Raman spectra were obtained from explosives particles trapped between highly fluorescent clothing fibres. Raman spectra were collected from explosives particles with maximum dimensions in the range 5-10 microm. Spectra of the explosives on dyed and undyed clothing substrates were readily obtained in-situ within 90 s and without sample preparation.",M2
19269427,"Selective spectrophotometric determination of <e>TNT</e> using a dicyclohexylamine-based colorimetric sensor.Because of the extremely heterogeneous distribution of explosives in contaminated soils, on-site colorimetric methods are efficient tools to assess the nature and extent of contamination. To meet the need for rapid and low-cost chemical sensing of explosive traces or residues in soil and post-blast debris, a colorimetric absorption-based sensor for trinitrotoluene (TNT) determination has been developed. The charge-transfer (CT) reagent (dicyclohexylamine, DCHA) is entrapped in a polyvinylchloride (PVC) polymer matrix plasticised with dioctylphtalate (DOP), and moulded into a transparent sensor membrane sliced into test strips capable of sensing TNT showing an absorption maximum at 530 nm when placed in a 1-mm spectrophotometer cell. The sensor gave a linear absorption response to 5-50 mg L(-1) TNT solutions in 30% aqueous acetone with limit of detection (LOD): 3 mg L(-1). The sensor is only affected by tetryl, but not by RDX, pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN), dinitrotoluene (DNT), and picric acid. The proposed method was statistically validated for TNT assay against high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a standard sample of Comp B. The developed sensor was relatively resistant to air and water, was of low-cost and high specificity, gave a rapid and reproducible response, and was suitable for field use of TNT determination in both dry and humid soil and groundwater with a portable colorimeter.",M2
19215963,"Simulated rainfall-driven dissolution of <e>TNT</e>, Tritonal, Comp B and Octol particles.Live-fire military training can deposit millimeter-sized particles of high explosives (HE) on surface soils when rounds do not explode as intended. Rainfall-driven dissolution of the particles then begins a process whereby aqueous HE solutions can enter the soil and groundwater as contaminants. We dripped water onto individual particles of TNT, Tritonal, Comp B and Octol to simulate how surface-deposited HE particles might dissolve under the action of rainfall and to use the data to verify a model that predicts HE dissolution as a function of particle size, particle composition and rainfall rate. Particle masses ranged from 1.1 to 17 mg and drip rates corresponded to nominal rainfall rates of 6 and 12 mmh(-1). For the TNT and Tritonal particles, TNT solubility governed dissolution time scales, whereas the lower-solubility of RDX controlled the dissolution time of both RDX and TNT in Comp B. The large, low-solubility crystals of HMX slowed but did not control the dissolution of TNT in Octol. Predictions from a drop-impingement dissolution model agree well with dissolved-mass timeseries for TNT, Tritonal and Comp B, providing some confidence that the model will also work well when applied to the rainfall-driven, outdoor dissolution of these HE particles.",M2

TNT and selected derivatives were reacted via alkaline hydrolysis as well as via free radical initiators through monochromatic irradiation and through Fenton reactions in complex competing transformation mechanisms. Only alkaline hydrolysis produced consistent and effective transformation intermediate and final products in this research. However, irradiation of the product generated by alkaline hydrolysis at 450 nm (wavelength of maximum absorption) caused complete disappearance of the spectra.",M2

19141797,"Behavior of energetic materials in ground water at an anti-tank range.An environmental issue has arisen with M-72 malfunction on anti-tank ranges because many of these rockets break into pieces without exploding on impact, dispersing their energetic materials content on the ground surface and exposing them to transport by infiltration of rainfall and snowmelt. A case study (1998--2005) at Arnhem Anti-Tank Range (Garrison Valcartier, Canada, in operation since the 1970s) revealed octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) contamination and traces of 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) in ground water at varying concentrations, with all detected HMX concentrations below the USEPA guideline for drinking water of 400 microg L(-1). An HMX mass balance on a transect perpendicular to ground water flow, about 300 m downgradient of the impact area, indicated an HMX flux of about 3 g d(-1) (0.7-1 kg yr(-1), 2005). The HMX mass in the impact area on the sand terrace was estimated at 7 to 10 kg (in 2005). The annual dissolved HMX flux represents about 10% of the source. The dissolved HMX plume in ground water consisted of a series of slugs, generated at each significant infiltration event. HMX is weakly retarded by sorption and is neither biotransformed nor mineralized under the aerobic conditions of the aquifer. TNT and RDX exceeded the USEPA guideline (2 microg L(-1) RDX and 1 microg L(-1) TNT) in three and two samples, respectively. The TNT plume was discontinuous because this compound was not always present at the ground surface. TNT is biotransformed, weakly sorbed, and not mineralized. In two wells, perchlorate associated with the propellant was found at concentrations above the Health Canada preliminary guideline of 6 microg L(-1) near the firing position.",M2
19110093,"Ultrasensitive detection of <e>TNT</e> in soil, water, using enhanced electrogenerated chemiluminescence.The ultrasensitive detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) was accomplished on the basis of sandwich-type TNT immunoassay combined with electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) technology. Biotinylated anti-TNT species were attached to the surface of 1-microm diameter streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MB) and 10-microm diameter avidin-coated polystyrene microspheres/beads (PSB) pre-loaded with ECL labels ( approximately 7 billion hydrophobic ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'-bipyridine) (Ru(II)) molecules per bead) to form anti-TNT&lt;--&gt;MB and anti-TNT&lt;--&gt;PSB(Ru(II)) conjugates, respectively. Sandwich-type PSB(Ru(II))&lt;--&gt;anti-TNT&lt;TNT&gt;anti-TNT&lt;--&gt;MB aggregates were formed when PSB(Ru(II))&lt;--&gt;anti-TNT was mixed with anti-TNT&lt;--&gt;MB conjugates in the presence of analyte TNT and 2.0% bovine serum albumin blocking agent. The newly formed aggregates were magnetically separated from the aqueous reaction media and dissolved in acetonitrile containing 0.10 M tri-n-propylamine ECL coreactant-0.055 M trifluoroacetic acid-0.10 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte. ECL as well as cyclic voltammetric measurements were carried out with a potential scan from 0 to 2.8 V vs Ag/Ag(+), and the integrated ECL intensity was found to be linearly proportional to the analyte TNT concentration over the range of 0.10-1000 ppt (pg mL(-1)). The limit of detection (&lt;or=0.10+/-0.01 ppb) is about 600x lower as compared with the most sensitive TNT detection method in the literature, and the absolute detection limit in mass ( approximately 0.1 pg) is only approximately 0.5% of that from mass spectroscopy.

A droplet analyzer was placed in the chamber prior to the detonation experiments to characterize the water mist used to mitigate the explosion overpressures. The impulse, initial blast wave, and quasi-static overpressure measured in the blast mitigation experiments were reduced by as much as 40%, 36%, 35% for TNT and 43%, 25%, 33% for Destex when water mist was sprayed 60s prior to detonation at a concentration of 70 g/m(3) and droplet Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) 54 microm.

In this study, TNT toxicity assessment was performed on spiked silica with this nitroaromatic compound by determination of the percent of emergence and shoots and roots biomasses at the concentration range of 3.2-10000 mg kg(-1) Dry Weight (DW). The emergence was reduced by 22-32% after 5 days of exposure at TNT concentrations up to 100 mg kg(-1) DW; shoot and root biomasses were reduced by 48-50 and 63-74%, respectively after 30 days exposure at TNT concentrations &lt; or = 32 mg kg(-1) DW. Concentrations higher than 100 mg kg(-1) DW can not be tolerated at all. Concentrations of TNT and its metabolites in silica, root and shoot were measured by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).

This transformation decreased at higher TNT soil concentrations. TNT is taken up and metabolized by plants to its downstream derivatives.",M2

The results showed that the pseudo-first order reaction law fit the reduction of TNT. The measured apparent rate constant (K(obs)) of TNT on nZVI (0.761 h(-1)) was 7.8-fold than on conventional iron powders (0.0979 h(-1)) at 303 K. The apparent activation energy (E(a)) of nZVI reducing TNT was found to be 24.85 KJ/mol, which was decreased by 60% compared to employing conventional iron powders. The apparent rate constant of TNT reduction on nZVI also can be improved by an increase in nZVI concentration, reaction temperature and a decrease of pH.",M2

Upon discharge, a transient, low-temperature non-equilibrium plasma comprising ions, electrons and metastable atoms are generated between the electrodes. Three common explosives, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), were directly desorbed and ionized from solid surfaces, followed by subsequent analysis using the mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode. Limits of detection (LODs) were 500 fg for TNT, 1 pg for RDX, and 500 fg for PETN. The reliability of the method was characterized by a successful analysis of a mixture of the three explosives. The ion source also allowed direct detection of trace explosives on both conductive and non-conductive substrates, thus expanding the applicability of low temperature plasma desorption mass spectrometry.",M2

Nitric oxide (NO) molecules are produced by the TNT photo-fragmentation processes via an intermediate production of NO(2). Our results reveal that the photo-fragmentation cross-section of TNT changes appreciably with change in wavelength with xenon arc lamp illumination, increasing with decreasing excitation wavelength.

19036516,"Effects of additives on 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) removal and its mineralization in aqueous solution by gamma irradiation.The effects of additives (i.e., methanol, EDTA, mannitol, thiourea, nitrous oxide, oxygen and ozone) on gamma irradiation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were investigated to elucidate the initial reaction mechanism of TNT degradation and suggest an practical method for complete by-product removal. All additives, except thiourea, significantly increased the TNT removal efficiency by gamma irradiation. The overall results of the additive experiments implied that the TNT decomposition would be initiated by *OH, e(aq)(-), and HO(2*)/O(2*)(-), and also implied that *H did not have any direct effect on the TNT decomposition. Additions of methanol and nitrous oxide were more effective in TNT removal than the other additives, achieving complete removal of TNT at doses below 20 kGy. Total organic carbon (TOC) of the irradiated solution was analyzed to evaluate the degree of TNT mineralization under the additive conditions. TOC under the nitrous oxide addition was removed rapidly, and complete TNT mineralization was thus achieved at 50 kGy. Methanol addition was very effective in the TNT removal, but it was not effective in reduction in TOC. Trinitrobenzene (TNB), oxalic acid and glyoxalic acid were detected as radiolytic organic by-products, while ammonia and nitrate were detected as radiolytic inorganic by-products. The most efficient TNT removal and its mineralization by gamma irradiation would be achieved by supersaturating the solution with nitrous oxide before irradiation.",M2

This work evaluated a continual system treatment reactor (CSTR) consisting of column zero-valent iron and a system to promote a fenton reaction in order to create possible definitive routines for treating effluents originating from the TNT production process. The spectrophotometric results demonstrated that this combination of processes was highly efficient in promoting the removal of all the absorbed species at 290 nm and the visible region of the specter. The results also revealed that the combination of treatments was significantly efficient in terms of correcting the effluent's main parameters of relevance, mainly COD (95.5% reduction) and TNT concentration, whose total was converted into nitrous and phenolic compounds and, additionally, the acute toxicity was also significantly reduced (95%).

The incorporation of the microorganisms into the explosive did not affect the quality of the explosive (5 years storage) in terms of detonation velocity while complete biotransformation of TNT moieties upon transfer in liquid media was observed after 5 days. The incorporated microorganisms reduced TNT sequentially leading to the formation of hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes (HADNT), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluenes; 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluenes, different azoxy compounds; 2,6-diaminonitrotoluenes (2,4-DAMNT) and 2,4-diaminonitrotoluenes (2,6-DAMNT).

18998409,"Enzymatic redox properties of novel nitrotriazole explosives implications for their toxicity.The toxicity of conventional nitroaromatic explosives like 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) is caused by their enzymatic free radical formation with the subsequent oxidative stress, the formation of alkylating nitroso and/or hydroxylamino metabolites, and oxyhemoglobin oxidation into methemoglobin. In order to get an insight into the mechanisms of toxicity of the novel explosives NTO (5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one) and ANTA (5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-amine), we examined their reactions with the single-electron transferring flavoenzymes NADPH: cytochrome P-450 reductase and ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase, two-electron transferring flavoenzymes mammalian NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase), and Enterobacter cloacae NAD(P)H:nitroreductase, and their reactions with oxyhemoglobin. The reactivity of NTO and ANTA in the above reactions was markedly lower than that of TNT. The toxicity of NTO and ANTA in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was partly prevented by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. This points to the involvement of oxidative stress in their cytotoxicity, presumably to the redox cycling of free radicals. The FLK cell line cytotoxicity and the methemoglobin formation in isolated human erythrocytes of NTO and ANTA were also markedly lower than those of TNT, and similar to those of nitrobenzene. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the low toxicity of nitrotriazole explosives may be attributed to their low electron-accepting properties.",M2

Etropole) which expresses the bacterial nitroreductase gene, pnrA, to tolerate and take-up greater amounts of the toxic and recalcitrant explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) from contaminated waters and soil. Transgenic aspen tolerate up to 57 mg TNT/L in hydroponic media and more than 1000 mg TNT/ kg soil, whereas the parental aspen could not endure in hydroponic culture with more than 11 mg TNT/L or soil with more than 500 mg TNT/kg. Likewise, the phytotoxicological limit for transgenic plants to a constant concentration of TNT was 20 mg TNT/L while wild-type plants only tolerated 10 mg TNT/L. Transgenic plants also showed improved uptake of TNT over wild-type plants when the original TNT concentration was above 35 mg TNT/L in liquid media or 750 mg TNT/kg in soil. Assays with 13C-labeled TNT show rapid adsorption of TNT to the root surface followed by a slower entrance rate into the plant. Most of the 13C-carbon from the labeled TNT taken up bythe plant (&gt; 95%) remains in the root with little translocation to the stem.

HK-6 under stress of <e>TNT</e> (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene).Scanning electron microscopy revealed pores and wrinkles on the surface of Pseudomonas sp. HK-6 cells grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 0.5 mM TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene). Exopolymer connections were also observed on the wild-type HK-6 cells but not on the algA mutant cells. In addition, the amount of exopolymer from HK strain increased from 90 to 210 microg/mL under TNT stress, whereas the algA mutant produced approximately 30 microg/mL, and its exopolymer production was little increased by TNT stress. These results indicate that TNT stress induced exopolymer production with alginate as a major component. The algA mutant degraded TNT more slowly than the wild-type HK-6 strain. HK-6 was able to completely degrade 0.5 mM TNT within 8 days, whereas algA mutant only achieved approximately 40% within the same time period. Even after 20 days, no more than 80% of TNT was degraded. According to analyses of proteomes of HK-6 and algA mutant cells grown under TNT stress or no stress, several proteins (KinB, AlgB, Alg8, and AlgL) in alginate biosynthesis were only highly induced by both strains under TNT stress. Interestingly, two stress-shock proteins (SSPs), GroEL and RpoH, were more highly expressed in the algA mutant than the HK-6 strain. The algA mutant was rendered more vulnerable to environmental stress and had reduced ability to metabolize TNT in the absence of alginate synthesis.",M2
18791012,"Subfunctionality of hydride transferases of the old yellow enzyme family of flavoproteins of Pseudomonas putida.To investigate potential complementary activities of multiple enzymes belonging to the same family within a single microorganism, we chose a set of Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) homologs of Pseudomonas putida. The physiological function of these enzymes is not well established; however, an activity associated with OYE family members from different microorganisms is their ability to reduce nitroaromatic compounds. Using an in silico approach, we identified six OYE homologs in P. putida KT2440. Each gene was subcloned into an expression vector, and each corresponding gene product was purified to homogeneity prior to in vitro analysis for its catalytic activity against 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>). One of the enzymes, called XenD, lacked in vitro activity, whereas the other five enzymes demonstrated type I hydride transferase activity and reduced the nitro groups of TNT to hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene derivatives. XenB has the additional ability to reduce the aromatic ring of TNT to produce Meisenheimer complexes, defined as type II hydride transferase activity. The condensations of the primary products of type I and type II hydride transferases react with each other to yield diarylamines and nitrite; the latter can be further reduced to ammonium and serves as a nitrogen source for microorganisms in vivo.",M2
18774158,"Expression of glutathione S-transferases in poplar trees (Populus trichocarpa) exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>).Twelve Populus genes were identified from Arabidopsis thaliana sequences previously shown to be induced by exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Using the resources of the Poplar Genome Project and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, Populus conserved domains were identified and used to design gene specific primers. RNA extracted from root tissues of TNT-exposed hydroponic poplar plants was used to quantify the expression of genes by reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cyclophilin and 18S ribosomal DNA genes were used as internal standards. Exposure to TNT resulted in a significant increase of gene expression of two glutathione S-transferases (GST), peaking at levels of 25.0 +/- 13.1 and 10 +/- 0.7 fold the expression level of non-exposed plants after 24 h for each of the GST genes, respectively. This paper demonstrates the use of functional genomics information from the model plant species, Arabidopsis, to identify genes which may be important in detoxification of TNT in the model phytoremediation species, Populus trichocarpa.",M2
18755196,"<e>TNT</e> detection using llama antibodies and a two-step competitive fluid array immunoassay.Llamas possess unique subclasses of antibodies that lack light chains, and thus are made by the pairing of two heavy chains. IgG was purified from two llamas which had been immunized with trinitrobenzene-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Conventional IgG1 and heavy chain IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses were fractionated using affinity chromatography. The effectiveness of heavy chain antibodies for the detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) using a competitive fluid array immunoassay was evaluated and compared to both the llama IgG1 as well as a murine monoclonal anti-TNT antibody. It was found that heavy chain antibody bound TNT with selectivity similar to conventional antibodies, yet the heavy chain antibodies possessed greater thermal stability. The titer of the heavy chain antibodies however was found to be 10-fold lower than the IgG1; thus analytical assays were best demonstrated using the llama IgG1 conventional antibody. The TNT competitive immunoassay on the Luminex fluid analyzer had a dynamic range from approximately 100 ng/mL to 10 microg/mL. Utilizing the same two-step competitive assay format the dynamic range of the monoclonal antibody was found to have a broad range (1 ng/mL to 1 microg/mL). This method was demonstrated on TNT contaminated soil extracts using both the llama IgG1 and the mouse monoclonal validating the utility of method for analysis of field samples.",M2
18712534,"Effect of plant extract on the degradation of nitroaromatic compounds by soil microorganisms.Remediation of soils contaminated by nitroaromatic compounds and nitramines, i.e. explosives, is known as very important, complicated, and rapidly developing area of biotechnology. A search for optimal growth conditions for soil bacteria is of a great importance in order to isolate various xenobiotic degraders. Bacteria consortium A43 was isolated from soils contaminated with explosives. In the presence of carbohydrate and plant extract, an addition of <e>TNT</e> to the solidified minimal medium stimulated the growth of the tested bacteria, as compared to other bacteria consortium isolated from the same soils. Reducing sugars as carbohydrates, and cabbage leaf extract as a plant extract were used in these experiments. Cultivation of the A43 in liquid medium of the same content showed that addition of cabbage leaf extract alone to medium is much more efficient for TNT degradation by growing biomass as compared to addition of carbohydrate alone.",M2
18702854,"Identification of explosives with two-dimensional ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy.The first two-dimensional (2D) resonance Raman spectra of <e>TNT</e>, RDX, HMX, and PETN are measured with an instrument that sequentially and rapidly switches between laser wavelengths, illuminating these explosives with forty wavelengths between 210 nm and 280 nm. Two-dimensional spectra reflect variations in resonance Raman scatter with illumination wavelength, adding information not available from single or few one-dimensional spectra, thereby increasing the number of variables available for use in identification, which is especially useful in environments with contaminants and interferents. We have recently shown that 2D resonance Raman spectra can identify bacteria. Thus, a single device that identifies the presence of explosives, bacteria, and other chemicals in complex backgrounds may be feasible.",M2
18702669,"Detoxification of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene in Arabidopsis: discovery of bifunctional O- and C-glucosyltransferases.Plants, as predominantly sessile organisms, have evolved complex detoxification pathways to deal with a diverse range of toxic chemicals. The elasticity of this stress response system additionally enables them to tackle relatively recently produced, novel, synthetic pollutants. One such compound is the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>). Large areas of soil and groundwater are contaminated with TNT, which is both highly toxic and recalcitrant to degradation, and persists in the environment for decades. Although TNT is phytotoxic, plants are able to tolerate low levels of the compound. To identify the genes involved in this detoxification process, we used microarray analysis and then subsequently characterized seven uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). Six of the recombinantly expressed UGTs conjugated the TNT-transformation products 2- and 4-hydroxylaminodinitrotoulene, exhibiting individual bias for either the 2- or the 4-isomer. For both 2- and 4-hydroxylaminodinitrotoulene substrates, two monoglucose conjugate products, confirmed by HPLC-MS-MS, were observed. Further analysis indicated that these were conjugated by either an O- or C-glucosidic bond. The other major compounds in TNT metabolism, aminodinitrotoluenes, were also conjugated by the UGTs, but to a lesser extent. These conjugates were also identified in extracts and media from Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture containing TNT. Overexpression of two of these UGTs, 743B4 and 73C1, in Arabidopsis resulted in increases in conjugate production, and enhanced root growth in 74B4 overexpression seedlings. Our results show that UGTs play an integral role in the biochemical mechanism of TNT detoxification by plants.",M2

Solid phase microextraction (SPME) has been coupled to IMS for the preconcentration of explosives and their volatile chemical markers and, although it has improved the LODs over a standalone IMS, it is limited to sampling in small vessels by the fiber geometry. Novel planar geometry SPME devices coated with PDMS and sol-gel PDMS that do not require an additional interface to IMS are now reported for the first time. The explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>), is sampled with the planar SPME reaching extraction equilibrium faster than with fiber SPME, concentrating detectable levels of TNT in a matter of minutes. The surface area, capacity, extraction efficiency, and LODs are also improved over fiber SPME allowing for sampling in larger volumes. The volatile chemical markers, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, cyclohexanone, and the taggant 4-nitrotoluene have also been successfully extracted by planar SPME and detected by IMS at mass loadings below 1 ng of extracted analyte on the planar device for TNT, for example.",M2
18627355,"Establishment of hapten-specific monoclonal avian IgY by conversion of antibody fragments obtained from combinatorial libraries.Nowadays, recombinant antibody and phage display technology enable the efficient generation of immunotools and a subsequent manipulation for optimized affinity, specificity or overall performance. Such advantages are of particular interest for haptenic target structures, such as <e>TNT</e> (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene). The toxicity of TNT and its breakdown products makes a reliable and fast detection of low levels in aqueous samples highly important. In the present study, we aimed for the generation of scFvs (single-chain antibody fragments) specific for the TNT-surrogate TNP (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) and their subsequent production as monoclonal avian IgY immunoglobulins providing improved assay performance. Therefore we subjected a human synthetic scFv library to selection following different strategies. TNP-specific human antibody fragments could be identified, characterized for their primary structure and evaluated for production as soluble scFv in Escherichia coli. Additionally, a murine TNP-specific antibody fragment was obtained from the hybridoma 11B3; however, the prokaryotic expression level was found to be limited. To generate and evaluate immunoglobulin formats with superior characteristics, all recombinant antibody fragments then were converted into two different chimaeric bivalent IgY antibody formats. After expression in mammalian cells, the IgY antibodies were assessed for their reactivity towards TNT. The IgY antibodies generated on the basis of the combinatorial library proved to be useful for detection of TNT, thereby emphasizing the high potential of this approach for the development of detection devices for immunoassay-based techniques.",M2
18620472,"Effects, uptake, and fate of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene aged in soil in plants and worms.The present study was aimed at providing data to be used at predicting exposure-based effects of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) aged in soil on endpoint organisms representing two trophic levels. These data can be used to define criteria or reference values for environmental management and conducting specific risk assessment. Long-term exposure tests were conducted to evaluate sublethal toxicity and uptake of aged soil-based explosives, with TNT as the main contaminant. In these tests, plants were exposed for 55 d, and biomass and explosives residues were determined. Worms were exposed for 28 and 42 d, and biomass, number, and tissue residues were determined. Biomass of Lolium perenne significantly decreased with soil-TNT concentration, and an effective concentration causing a 20% decrease in biomass (EC20) for TNT metabolites of 3.75 mg/kg was calculated. The concentrations of TNT metabolites in shoots and roots were significantly related to concentrations in soil, as were concentrations of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX). The mean bioconcentration factors, indicating the potential of a chemical to accumulate in an organism, were 0.9 for TNT metabolites, 71.8 for RDX, and 12.2 for HMX in L. perenne shoots. Biomass of Eisenia fetida adults significantly decreased with soil-TNT concentration, and an EC20 for TNT of 3.70 mg/kg was calculated. The TNT, RDX, and HMX levels in E. fetida were below detection.",M2

Kinetically, TNT, and compounds 1 and 2 were characterized as the nonessential activators of butyrylcholinesterase. TNT, and compounds 1 and 2 were hydrophobic compounds and were proposed to bind to the hydrophobic activator binding site, which was located outside the active site gorge of the enzyme. The conformational change from a normal active site gorge to a more accessible active site gorge of the enzyme was proposed after binding of TNT, and compounds 1 and 2 to the activator binding site of the enzyme. Therefore, TNT, and compounds 1 and 2 may act as the excess of butyrylcholine in the substrate activator for the butyrylcholinesterase catalyzed reactions.",M2

The goal of this study was to determine the acute toxic effects of TNT, 2,4-DNT, and 2,6-DNT in adult male bullfrogs. The LD(50) for TNT was 1,060 mg/kg BW while the LD(50 )for 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT was 1,098 mg/kg BW.

The electrolytic experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the performance of mineralization of total organic compounds (TOC) in spent acid, including electrode potential, reaction temperature, oxygen dosage and concentration of sulfuric acid. It is worth noting that organic compounds could be completely mineralized by hydrogen peroxide obtained from cathodic reduction of oxygen, which was mainly supplied by anodic oxidation of water. Based on the spectra identified by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), it is proposed that oxidative degradation of 2,4-DNT and/or 2,6-DNT, 2,4,6-TNT results in o-mononitrotoluene (MNT) and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, respectively.

18504997,"Absorption, tissue distribution, and elimination of residues after 2,4,6-trinitro[14C]toluene administration to sheep.The compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) is a persistent contaminant of some industrial and military sites. Biological bioremediation techniques typically rely on the immobilization of TNT reduction products rather than on TNT mineralization. We hypothesized that sheep ruminal microbes would be suitable for TNT destruction after phytoremediation of TNT-contaminated soils by cool-season grasses. Therefore we investigated the fate of [14C]TNT in ruminating sheep to determine the utility of ruminant animals as a portion of the bioremediation process. Three wether sheep were dosed with 35.5 mg each of dietary unlabeled TNT for 21 consecutive days. On day 22 sheep (41.9 +/- 3.0 kg) were orally dosed with 35.5 mg of [14C]TNT (129 microCi; 99.1% radiochemical purity). Blood, urine, and feces were collected at regular intervals for 72 h. At slaughter, tissues were quantitatively collected. Tissues and blood were analyzed for total radioactive residues (TRR); excreta were analyzed for TRR, bound residues, and TNT metabolites. Plasma radioactivity peaked within 1 h of dosing and was essentially depleted within 18 h. Approximately 76% of the radiocarbon was excreted in feces, 17% in urine, with 5% being retained in the gastrointestinal tract and 1% retained in tissues. Parent TNT, dinitroamino metabolites, and diaminonitro metabolites were not detected in excreta. Ruminal and fecal radioactivity was essentially nonextractable using ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol; covalent binding of fecal radioactive residues was evenly distributed among extractable organic molecules (i.e., soluble organic matter, soluble carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and nucleic acid fractions) and undigested fibers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). This study demonstrated that TNT reduction within the ruminant gastrointestinal tract leads to substantial immobilization of residues to organic matter, a fate similar to TNT in other strongly reducing environments.",M2
18504560,"Biosensor-based on-site explosives detection using aptamers as recognition elements.Reliable observation, detection and characterisation of polluted soil are of major concern in regions with military activities in order to prepare efficient decontamination. Flexible on-site analysis may be facilitated by biosensor devices. With use of fibre-optic evanescent field techniques, it has been shown that immunoaffinity reactions can be used to determine explosives sensitively. Besides antibodies as molecular recognition elements, high-affinity nucleic acids (aptamers) can be employed. Aptamers are synthetically generated and highly efficient binding molecules that can be derived for any ligand, including small organic molecules like drugs, explosives or derivatives thereof. In this paper we describe the development of specific aptamers detecting the explosives molecule <e>TNT</e>. The aptamers are used as a sensitive capture molecule in a fibre-optic biosensor. In addition, through the biosensor measurements the aptamers could be characterised. The advantages of the aptamer biosensor include its robustness, its ability to discriminate between different explosives molecules while being insensitive to other chemical entities in natural soil and its potential to be incorporated into a portable device. Results can be obtained within minutes. The measurement is equally useful for soil that has been contaminated for a long time and for urgent hazardous spills.",M2

Aromatic alkanedithiol SAMs were firstly formed on Au sensor surface and TNT analogues were immobilized on it through OEG chain. Two kinds of OEG containing amine compounds, where H(2)N(C(2)H(4)O)(11)C(2)H(4)NHCOOC(CH(3))(3) served as a linker to react with carboxyl groups of TNT analogues while H(2)N(C(2)H(4)O)(3)C(2)H(4)OH served as a protein non-fouling background, were covalently bound to carboxyl terminal groups of SAMs with a certain ratio. Optimal ratio of them was also examined. Three kinds of TNT analogues, namely TNP-glycine, DNP-glycine, and DNP-acetic acid were used as immobilized ligands. Highly sensitive TNT detection by indirect competitive assay was conducted on the fabricated sensor surfaces; we examined how structural variations of them affect sensitivity in order to choose optimal hapten as well to improve sensitivity. The DNP-acetic acid immobilized surface, which had the lowest affinity to the TNT antibody among the three, showed the best limit of detection (LOD) value (ca. 80 ppt (pg ml(-1))). On the other hand, the TNP-glycine immobilized surface, which had the highest affinity, showed the worst LOD value (ca. 220 ppt). The LOD got lower to ca. 50 ppt by the use of the secondary antibody on the DNP-acetic acid immobilized surface. The sensor surfaces are durable for more than 100 times repeated use without any noticeable deterioration by their chemical stability and rather mild regeneration condition.",M2

Therefore, effect of exchangeable cations (NH4+ , K+, Ca2+, and Al3+) on sorption-desorption of trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) was studied in two reference soils viz sandy loam and silty clay. Compared to control soils, K+ ion saturation significantly increased TNT sorption in both the soils, while other cations decreased TNT sorption. Effect of K+ saturation on sorption of TNT was more pronounced in organic matter poor sandy loam soil (seven times) then silty clay (two times). Desorption followed the reverse trend and greater amounts of sorbed TNT were retained in the K+ saturated soils.",M2
18481903,"Toxicological responses of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) to subchronic soil exposures of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.Since World War I, trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) has been the most commonly used explosive. Environmental contamination associated with synthesis, manufacture of weapons, and use during training exercises has been extensive, with soil concentrations reaching 145,000 mg/kg. Some of these areas include habitats for amphibian species. Earlier studies have shown that salamanders dermally absorb TNT from soil. To ascertain what soil concentrations of TNT are toxic to amphibians, red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) were exposed to one of five concentrations of TNT in soil for 28 d and evaluated for indicators of toxicity. A total of 100 salamanders were randomly sorted by weight and assigned to target TNT concentrations in soil of either 3,000, 1,500, 750, 325, or 0 mg/kg dry weight. Food consisted of uncontaminated flightless Drosophila melanogaster. Survival was reduced in salamanders exposed to 1,500 and 3,000 mg/kg by 10 and 55%, respectively. Most mortality/morbidity occurred within the first week of exposure. Salamanders had a reduction in hemoglobin at 750 mg/kg or greater and a reduction in red blood cell concentration at 1,500 mg/kg or greater. Food consumption was affected in salamanders at 750 mg/kg or greater; a reduction in body mass and liver glycogen content also occurred at and above this concentration. Splenic congestion also was observed in salamanders from these groups. These data suggest that soil TNT concentrations of 373 +/- 41.0 mg/kg or greater result in reduced body mass, reduced feed intake, and hematological effects.",M2

Terrorist explosive, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), difficult to detect by IMS in E-mode, was detected in N-mode (for narcotics). Three modes of sample introduction to IMS vapor desorption unit were used: (i) placement of hair directly into the unit, (ii) swabbing of hair and placement of swabs (i.e., paper GE-IMS sample traps) into the unit, and (iii) acetonitrile extracts of hair positioned on sample traps and placed into the unit. TNT, NG, and EGDN were detected in E-mode by all three sample introduction methods. TATP could only be detected by the acetonitrile extraction method after exposure of the hair to vapor for 16 days because of lower sensitivity. With standard solutions, TATP detection in E-mode required about 10 times as much sample as EGDN (3.9 mug compared with 0.3 mug).

The relative effects of the benzene (BENZ)- and diethylbenzene (DEB)-bridged organic-inorganic polymers, having narrow or broad pore size distributions, respectively, on electrochemical response and desorption behavior were examined. Sample volumes of 0.5-10 mL containing 5-1000 ppb TNT in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer were preconcentrated in-line before the detector using a microcolumn containing 10 mg of imprinted BENZ or DEB. Square-wave voltammetry was used to detect the first reduction peak of TNT in an electrochemical flow cell using a carbon working electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Imprinted BENZ released TNT faster than imprinted DEB with considerably less peak tailing and displayed enhanced sensitivity and an improvement in the limit of detection (LOD) owing to more rapid elution of TNT from that material with increasing signal amplitude. For imprinted BENZ, the slope of signal versus concentration scaled linearly with increasing preconcentration volume, and for preconcentrating 10 mL of sample, the LOD for TNT was estimated to be 5 ppb. Template-directed molecularly imprinted DEB (TDMI-DEB) was 7-fold more efficient in adsorption of TNT from aqueous contaminated soil extract than nonimprinted DEB.",M2

The interaction of both living and to less extent dead bacterial cells with TNT results in the accumulation of superoxide anion (O2*-) in the extracellular medium, which was revealed by the EPR spectroscopy. The accumulation of O2*- decreased by 50-70% in the presence of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase of animal origin. In the presence of living bacterial cells, the level of TNT decreased progressively, yielding hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes together with O2*-. In the presence of heat-killed cells, a moderate decrease in TNT was observed, and the appearance of O2*- was not accompanied by the production of any detectable TNT metabolites. Chelating agents inhibited the transformation of TNT and decreased the formation of O2*-. The demonstrated generation of O2*- during the interaction of TNT with K4[Fe(CN)6] together with the observed effects of chelating agents suggest the participation of iron in the one-electron reduction of TNT and the functioning of an extracellular redox cycle with the involvement of molecular oxygen.",M2
18444069,"Mobility and degradation of trinitrotoluene/metabolites in soil columns: effect of soil organic carbon content.There has been increasing interest in enhancing natural attenuation of munitions-contaminated soils. Present study reports the effect of increasing soil organic matter content on fate and mobility of trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) and metabolites in soil columns. This study was performed using 30-cm-long columns containing a top 5 cm of contaminated soil as a source layer and an uncontaminated soil (25 cm) adjusted to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0% organic carbon (OC) content using compost. Contaminated soil layer was fortified with uniformly ring-labeled (14)C-trinitrotoluene (TNT) or 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT); in total there were 8 treatments. Columns were leached with synthetic rain water under unsaturated flow conditions in downside up direction. There was significant increase in the retention of both (14)C-TNT and (14)C-DNT in soils with increasing soil OC content and in 3.0% soil OC content column &lt; 1% TNT/DNT was recovered in the leachate. Further, degradation of TNT and metabolites from contaminated soil was significantly increased and resulted in greater soil-bound residues. Formation of monoamino-dinitrotoluene (ADNTs), diamino-mononitrotoluene (DANTs) and monoamino-mononitrotoluene (ANTs) metabolites was greatly enhanced with increase in OC content of soils. Study suggests that increasing OC content of contaminated soil to 3.0% significantly enhanced the reduction of nitroaromatics to more polar amine metabolites and the formation of soil-bound residues.",M2

The electrolytic experiments were carried out to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the performance of mineralization of total organic compounds (TOC) in spent acid, including reaction temperature, dosage of oxygen, sulfuric acid concentration and dosage of ferrous ions. It deserves to note that organic compounds could be completely destructed by Electro-Fenton's reagent with in situ electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide obtained from cathodic reduction of oxygen, which was mainly supplied by anodic oxidation of water. Based on the spectra analyzed by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, it is proposed that initial denitration of 2,4,6-TNT gives rise to formation of 2,4-DNT and/or 2,6-DNT, which undergo the cleavage of nitro group into o-mononitrotoluene, followed by denitration to toluene and subsequent oxidation of the methyl group.

To provide data useful in assessing ecological risk for reptilian species, acute, subacute, and subchronic oral toxicity studies were conducted with the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis). Oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for TNT in corn oil were 1,038 and 1,579 mg/kg of body weight for male and female lizards, respectively. Overt signs of toxicity included chromaturia, abdominal enlargement, and tremors. A 14-d subacute study followed in which male lizards were orally dosed with TNT (corn oil) at 0, 33, 66, 132, 263, 525, and 1,050 mg/kg of body weight each day. Clinical signs of toxicity, while similar to the LD50 study, were more subtle and noted in lizards receiving TNT amounts of at least 66 mg/kg/d. Chromaturia was an early consistent sign, often preceding the onset of adverse effects. Male lizards in the 60-d subchronic study were dosed at 0, 3, 15, 25, 35, and 45 mg/kg/d with nearly complete survival (&gt;90%) for lizards in all treatments. Changes in food consumption and body weight were observed at 35 and 45 mg/kg/d. Alterations in hematological end points; blood chemistries (albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, calcium); kidney, spleen, and liver weights; and adverse histopathology were observed in lizards exposed at 25 to 45 mg/kg/d. Testosterone concentration, sperm count, and motility were variable between treatments. Although not significant, incidences of hypospermia and testicular atrophy were observed in some individuals. Together, these data suggest a lowest-observed-adverse effect level of 25 mg/kg/d and a no-observed-adverse effect level of 15 mg/kg/d in S. occidentalis.",M2
18366604,"Transcriptomic analysis of RDX and <e>TNT</e> interactive sublethal effects in the earthworm Eisenia fetida.BACKGROUND: Explosive compounds such as TNT and RDX are recalcitrant contaminants often found co-existing in the environment. In order to understand the joint effects of TNT and RDX on earthworms, an important ecological and bioindicator species at the molecular level, we sampled worms (Eisenia fetida) exposed singly or jointly to TNT (50 mg/kg soil) and RDX (30 mg/kg soil) for 28 days and profiled gene expression in an interwoven loop designed microarray experiment using a 4k-cDNA array. Lethality, growth and reproductive endpoints were measured. RESULTS: Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX had no significant effects on the survival and growth of earthworms, but significantly reduced cocoon and juvenile counts. The mixture exhibited more pronounced reproductive toxicity than each single compound, suggesting an additive interaction between the two compounds. In comparison with the controls, we identified 321 differentially expressed transcripts in TNT treated worms, 32 in RDX treated worms, and only 6 in mixture treated worms. Of the 329 unique differentially expressed transcripts, 294 were affected only by TNT, 24 were common to both TNT and RDX treatments, and 3 were common to all treatments. The reduced effects on gene expression in the mixture exposure suggest that RDX might interact in an antagonistic manner with TNT at the gene expression level. The disagreement between gene expression and reproduction results may be attributed to sampling time, absence of known reproduction-related genes, and lack of functional information for many differentially expressed transcripts. A gene potentially related to reproduction (echinonectin) was significantly depressed in TNT or RDX exposed worms and may be linked to reduced fecundity. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal doses of TNT and RDX affected many biological pathways from innate immune response to oogenesis, leading to reduced reproduction without affecting survival and growth. A complex interaction between mixtures of RDX and TNT was observed at the gene expression level that requires further study of the dynamics of gene expression and reproductive activities in E. fetida. These efforts will be essential to gain an understanding of the additive reproductive toxicity between RDX and TNT.",M2
18378298,"Effects of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) on phase I and phase II biotransformation enzymes in European eel Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758).The aim of this study was to investigate effects of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) on liver drug metabolizing genes and enzymes in the European eel Anguilla anguilla as a model fish species. Eels were exposed in vivo for 6h and 24h to 0.5, 1 and 2.5mg/L nominal concentrations of TNT. Expression of CYP1A, glutathione-S-transferase (pi-class; GST) and uridine-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (1-family) (UDPGT) genes was investigated by RT-PCR, and 7-ethoxy- and 7-methoxyresorufin-O-dealkylases (EROD, MROD), NADPH cyt c reductase (NADPH red), UDPGT and GST enzyme activities were measured by biochemical assays. An in vitro study was also performed, measuring only EROD activity. TNT exposure produced no modulation of CYP1A transcript expression while a significant inhibition of EROD enzyme activity was observed and confirmed in vitro. UDPGT transcript increased dose-dependently only at 6h while the UDPGT activity tended to increase dose-dependently at 24h. GST gene expression increased after 24h and significant increases of GST activity were observed both at 6 and 24h only at the highest TNT concentration. An increase of NADPH red activity was observed at 24h. Our results seem to indicate an inhibitory effect of TNT on CYP1A-dependent catalytic activities and a possible involvement of phase II enzymes as well as NADPH red in TNT metabolism in eels.",M2
18357446,"Denitration of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ESA-5 in the presence of ferrihydrite.Denitration of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) was evaluated in oxygen-depleted enrichment cultures. These cultures were established starting with an uncontaminated or a TNT-contaminated soil inoculum and contained TNT as sole nitrogen source. Incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of ferrihydrite. A significant release of nitrite was observed in the liquid culture containing TNT, ferrihydrite, and inoculum from a TNT-contaminated soil. Under these conditions, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant bacterium in the enrichment, leading to the isolation of P. aeruginosa ESA-5 as a pure strain. The isolate had TNT denitration capabilities as confirmed by nitrite release in oxygen-depleted cultures containing TNT and ferrihydrite. In addition to reduced derivatives of TNT, several unidentified metabolites were detected. Concomitant to a decrease of TNT concentration, a release of nitrite was observed. The concentration of nitrite peaked and then it slowly decreased. In the absence of TNT, the drop in the concentration of nitrite in oxygen-depleted cultures was lower when ferrihydrite was provided, suggesting that ferrihydrite inhibited the utilization of nitrite by P. aeruginosa ESA-5.",M2
18353550,"Estimating the <e>TNT</e> equivalence of a 15-ton single base powder explosion through damaged building profiles analyses.Back in 1964 President Vargas Works was the only place in the country which processed single base powder for the Brazilian Armed Forces. Then its industrial activity was quite strong and around 4:45 a.m. of 23rd September an intense decomposition of nearly 15 ton of that material took place in one of the production lines workshops. The consequences of this explosion were the destruction and extensive damage to the workshops around its epicenter. At that time pictures of all affected buildings were taken and their damages fully described. This led to the present work which consists in the evaluation of the TNT equivalent charge of the explosion using the concept of damage category developed by UK engineers based on the WWII damaging bombing data.",M2
18338283,"Interaction of hydration, aging, and carbon content of soil on the evaporation and skin bioavailability of munition contaminants.Water plays a key role in enhancing the permeability of human skin to many substances. To further understand its ability to potentially increase the bioavailability of soil contaminants, artificial sweat was applied to excised pig skin prior to dosing with munition-contaminated soils. Skin was mounted in chambers to allow simultaneous measurement of evaporation and penetration and to control air flow, which changed the dwell time of skin surface water within a l-h period post application of test materials. Additional variables included type of compound, aging of spiked soil samples, and carbon content of soil. To this end, the evaporation and skin penetration of C-14 labeled hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (26DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (<e>TNT</e>) were determined from two soil types, Yolo, having 1.2% carbon, and Tinker, having 9.5% carbon. RDX soil samples aged 27 mo and 62 mo were compared to freshly spiked soils samples. Similarly, 26DNT samples aged 35-36 mo and TNT samples aged 18 mo were compared to freshly spiked samples. Approximately 10 microg/cm(2) of radiolabeled compound was applied in 10 mg/cm(2) of soil. Radiolabel recovered from the dermis and tissue culture media (receptor fluid) was summed to determine percent absorption from the soils. Radiolabel recovered from vapor traps determined evaporation. Mean skin absorption of all compounds was higher for low-carbon soil, regardless of soil age and skin surface water as affected by air flow conditions. For 26DNT, a simultaneous increase in evaporation and penetration with conditions that favored enhanced soil hydration of freshly prepared samples was consistent with a mechanism that involved water displacement of 26DNT from its binding sites. A mean penetration of 17.5 +/- 3.6% was observed for 26DNT in low-carbon soil, which approached the value previously reported for acetone vehicle (24 +/- 6%). 26DNT penetration was reduced to 0.35% under dryer conditions and to 0.08% when no sweat was applied. When soil hydration conditions were not varied from cell to cell, air flow that favored a longer water dwell time increased penetration, but not evaporation, consistent with a mechanism of enhanced skin permeability from a higher hydration state of the stratum corneum. Profiles of 26DNT penetration versus air flow conditions were exponential for freshly prepared soil samples, suggesting strong and weak binding sites; corresponding profiles of 26DNT penetration from aged samples were linear, suggesting a conversion of weak to strong binding sites. Absorption and evaporation was less than 5% for TNT and less than 1% for RDX, regardless of soil type and age. Fresh preparations of RDX in Tinker soil and aged samples of TNT in Yolo soil showed a significant decrease in skin absorption with loss of surface moisture. The penetration rate of radiolabel into the receptor fluid was highest during the 1-2 h interval after dosing with 26DNT or TNT. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 26DNT in receptor fluid at maximum flux indicated no metabolism or breakdown. For TNT, however, extensive conversion to monoamino derivatives and other metabolites was observed. Relatively little radioactivity was found in the dermis after 26DNT and TNT applications, and dermal extracts were therefore not analyzed by HPLC. RDX was not sufficiently absorbed from soils to allow HPLC analysis. This study has practical significance, as the use of water for dust control at remediation sites may have the unintended effect of increasing volatilization and subsequent absorption of soil contaminants. Soil in contact with sweaty skin may give the same result. Skin absorption of 26DNT from soil was over 50-fold higher than the value for dryer skin and over 200-fold higher than the value obtained when there was no sweat application. While the hydration effect was less dramatic for RDX and TNT, soil contaminants more closely matching the physical properties of 26DNT may be similarly affected by hydration.",M2
18400248,"Microtox toxicity test: detoxification of <e>TNT</e> and RDX contaminated solutions by poplar tissue cultures.Poplar (Populus deltoidesxnigra DN34) tissue cultures removed 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) from an aqueous solution in five days, reducing the toxicity of the solution from highly toxic Microtox EC value to that of the control. 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane (RDX) was taken up by the plant tissue cultures more slowly, but toxicity reduction of the solution was evident. The measurement of toxicity reduction of aqueous solutions containing TNT and RDX was performed using a novel methodology developed for use with the Microtox testing system. Radiolabeled TNT and RDX were used to confirm removal of explosives from hydroponic solutions containing plant tissue cultures and to verify that toxicity did not change in solutions where no plant cultures were present (positive controls). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) measurements confirmed removal of TNT and RDX from solutions containing poplar plant tissue cultures and constancy of the plant-free controls. In addition, metabolites were identified in remediated solutions by HPLC, confirming the mechanism by which plants can remediate groundwater, surface water, and soil solutions.",M2
18384944,"Interaction of soil, water and <e>TNT</e> during degradation of TNT on contaminated soil using subcritical water.Subcritical water was used at laboratory scale to reveal information with respect to the degradation mechanism of TNT on contaminated soil. Highly contaminated soil (12% TNT) was heated with water at four different temperatures, 150, 175, 200 and 225 degrees C and samples were obtained at appropriate time intervals. At the same time, similar experiments were performed with TNT spiked on to clean soil, sand and pure water in order to compare and eliminate various factors that may be present in the more complex contaminated soil system. Subcritical water was successful at remediating TNT-contaminated soil. TNT destruction percentages ranged between 98 and 100%. The aim of this work was to study the soil-water-contaminant interaction and determine the main physical parameters that affect TNT degradation. It was shown that the rate-limiting step of the process is the extraction/diffusion of TNT molecules from the soil core to the soil surface, where they degrade. Additionally, it was determined that the soil matrix also catalyses degradation to a lesser extent. Autocatalytic effects were not clearly observed.",M2
