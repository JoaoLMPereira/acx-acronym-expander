8327658,"Thrombopoietin from human embryonic kidney cells stimulates an increase in megakaryocyte size of sublethally irradiated mice.Previous work showed that treatment of irradiated mice with a thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) decreased the degree and duration of thrombocytopenia in the period after irradiation. In an attempt to elucidate the radio-protective effects of TSF, femoral megakaryocyte sizes and numbers were measured in mice treated with 3.0 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays and TSF. For controls, other irradiated mice were given human serum albumin (HSA), the carrier protein for TSF, rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS), or normal rabbit serum (NRS); megakaryocyte sizes and numbers were studied on Days 7-14. The results showed that irradiated, TSF-treated mice had significantly larger megakaryocytes on all days assessed compared to HSA-treated control mice. Likewise, RAMPS-treated mice had significantly larger megakaryocytes 14 days after irradiation compared to NRS-treated mice. Megakaryocyte numbers were significantly depressed in TSF-treated mice on Days 7-10 and 14 and on Day 10 in RAMPS-treated mice, compared to their respective controls. Therefore, irradiated mice treated with TSF yielded results similar to RAMPS-treated mice. Megakaryocyte sizes and numbers were also determined for mice treated with 40,000 U/mouse of interleukin-6 (IL-6), 227 U/mouse of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or a combination of both cytokines; bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a control for these cytokine treatments. Unlike TSF treatment, GM-CSF significantly increased megakaryocyte numbers on both Days 10 and 14; the combination of both growth factors also increased megakaryocyte numbers on Day 14 compared to BSA-treated control mice. However, megakaryocyte size was decreased in GM-CSF-treated mice and in mice treated with both growth factors on Day 10. High levels of IL-6 failed to affect megakaryocyte size or number significantly on any day evaluated. The data of the present report, showing that TSF significantly increases megakaryocyte sizes and platelet counts of sublethally irradiated mice, indicate that thrombopoietin will be useful in treating patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation and/or patients with platelet production problems.",M1
1410278,"Thrombopoietin from human embryonic kidney cells causes increased thrombocytopoiesis in sublethally irradiated mice.Previous work showed that mice treated with platelet-specific antiserum prior to whole-body irradiation did not suffer the degree or duration of thrombocytopenia as did irradiated control mice. We now report that a partially purified preparation of a thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) mimics the biological effects of platelet-specific antiserum treatment in hematopoietically suppressed mice. Male C3H mice were exposed to 3.0 or 4.5 Gy of 137Cs gamma radiation and injected with a total dose of 4 units (U) of TSF. Human serum albumin (HSA) and rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum-injected mice, along with unirradiated mice, served as controls. Packed cell volumes (PCV), RBC counts, WBC counts, platelet counts, and percentage 35S incorporation into platelets were measured in mice at various days (7-14) following treatment. The results showed that irradiated mice treated with TSF had increased 35S uptake into platelets and higher platelet counts than HSA-treated controls. Also, PCV, RBC counts, and WBC counts of irradiated mice treated with TSF were significantly higher than values for HSA-treated mice. Additional experiments using 40,000 U/mouse of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), 227 U/mouse of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or a combination of GM-CSF and IL-6 did not show increased platelet counts or 35S incorporation into platelets on Days 10 and 14 when compared to other mice treated with control substances. These results suggest that the radioprotective effects of platelet antibodies reported previously may be due to the release and action of thrombopoietin. These studies also demonstrate that thrombopoietin therapy will modulate the severe thrombocytopenia that occurs in radiation-induced bone marrow suppression.",M1
1550268,"Thrombopoietin. Its biology, clinical aspects, and possibilities.Thrombopoietin or thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) is known to be the natural stimulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and, thus, stimulates thrombocytopoiesis. In the past 15 years, new assay technology and sources of the hormone have made possible partial characterization of the molecule and clarification of the biologic role of thrombopoietin. Experiments describing the biology and characterization of TSF are reviewed. In addition, a brief history of the molecule, its biology, and the effects of thrombopoietin on both thrombocytopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis are discussed, including the effects of thrombopoietin on platelet counts, platelet sizes, and incorporation of isotopes. In the discussion of thrombopoietin's control of megakaryocytopoiesis there is specific information showing that thrombopoietin stimulates an increase in megakaryocyte size and number, DNA content, endomitosis, and maturation. Thrombopoietin also increases the number of early precursor cells of the megakaryocytic series, that is, small acetyl-cholinesterase-positive cells. New information is given on the chemistry of thrombopoietin, along with present assays and the relationship of thrombopoietin to interleukin-6. The clinical aspects of thrombopoietin, with detailed descriptions of several disease states in which decreases and excesses of the hormone have been found, are presented. The potential uses of thrombopoietin in clinical medicine are reviewed. In the near future, it appears that successful gene cloning of the hormone will be achieved, which will allow production of large amounts of recombinant thrombopoietin. The pure material will be helpful in clarifying the hormone's mode of action. Thrombopoietin will no doubt prove to be useful in treating patients with various hematologic disorders, such as patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, and other patients with various types of marrow hypoplasia.",M1
1993216,"Comparative effects of thrombopoietin and interleukin-6 on murine megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production.A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells is known to increase platelet production and to increase the number of morphologically unrecognizable early megakaryocytes, ie, small acetylcholinesterase-positive (SAChE+) cells in mice. Other recent studies have concluded that interleukin-6 (IL-6) also stimulates murine megakaryocytopoiesis both in vitro and in vivo. Some workers have suggested that IL-6 is thrombopoietin. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of TSF and IL-6 on percent 35S incorporation into platelets, platelet sizes, and the percentages of SAChE+ cells in C3H mice, and to determine if they produce the same or different responses. The results showed that two or four injections of a partially purified TSF (total dose of 2 or 4 units (U) over a 1- or 2-day period) increased percent 35S incorporation into platelets (P less than .005) and platelet sizes (P less than .005) of both normal and rebound-thrombocytotic mice when compared with values from other mice treated with human serum albumin, the carrier protein for both TSF and IL-6. In eight separate experiments, it was shown that IL-6 (40,000 U, 4 micrograms), when given to rebound-thrombocytotic mice in four injections over a 2-day period, produced a small but significant (P less than .005) increase in percent 35S incorporation into platelets. Additional studies showed that negative results were obtained when similar high doses of IL-6 were administered in two doses over a 1-day period. TSF, but not IL-6, stimulated an increase in platelet sizes of normal mice (P less than .005 to 0.0005); however, IL-6 increased platelet sizes of rebound-thrombocytotic mice when given in two of four injections (P less than .05 to .0005). Also, IL-6, but not TSF, caused anemia in normal mice (P less than .0005) that were given two injections and tested 3 days later. TSF stimulated an increase (P less than .005) in the percentage of SA-ChE+ cells; whereas IL-6, even at high doses, did not. Because of the observed differences in biologic responses of these two cytokines, we conclude that TSF and IL-6 are separate entities.",M1
2199205,"Thrombopoietin derived from human embryonic kidney cells stimulates an increase in DNA content of murine megakaryocytes in vivo.A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) is known to increase the size and number of mouse bone marrow megakaryocytes, to increase the proportion of megakaryocytes in endomitosis, and to increase the number of small acetylcholinesterase-positive cells. Megakaryocyte ploidy values have not previously been measured in mice treated with TSF from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Therefore, in the present study C3H mice were injected with approximately 4 U of step II TSF; platelet production indices and megakaryocyte ploidy values were measured 1-5 days after treatment. For controls, other mice were injected with saline, human serum albumin (HSA), normal rabbit serum (NRS), or rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS). Platelet counts, platelet sizes, and percent 35S incorporation into platelets were measured using standard techniques. For measurement of megakaryocyte DNA content, bone marrow cells were collected into CATCH medium and incubated with RAMPS, followed by labeling with a saturating concentration of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragment. After washing, the cells were resuspended in propidium iodide, and DNA content was measured by flow cytometry. When compared to suitable control values, the results showed that TSF caused a significant (p less than 0.025) increase in platelet counts of treated mice by 3 days; both TSF and RAMPS caused significant (p less than 0.0005) increases in platelet sizes and percent 35S incorporation into platelets of mice at 2 and 3 days after treatment. The most frequent polyploid DNA class of megakaryocytes from untreated C3H mice was 32N, confirming our previous observation. Both TSF and RAMPS caused significant (p less than 0.0005) increases in the average polyploid megakaryocyte DNA content, with peak values on days 2 and 3. These data show that TSF administered in vivo significantly increases DNA content of mouse bone marrow megakaryocytes.",M1
2199204,"Thrombopoiesis-stimulating factor: its effects on megakaryocyte colony formation in vitro and its relation to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.The effects of thrombopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) on human marrow megakaryocyte colony formation in vitro were studied by the plasma clot method. TSF was found to stimulate megakaryocyte as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony formation in vitro at optimal concentrations of 200-300 pg/ml of medium containing 2.5% horse serum. This colony-stimulating effect of TSF was not affected by polyclonal antibodies to human (h) interleukin 3 (IL-3) or to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) but was neutralized by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF). In order to differentiate among cross-reactivity between TSF and hGM-CSF, induction of colony growth via release of GM-CSF, and presence of hGM-CSF in TSF preparations, TSF was tested on murine marrow cells, which are not responsive to hGM-CSF. TSF induced growth of murine megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MK) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in vitro with a dose response similar to that observed on human marrow cells; however, this effect could not be neutralized by antibodies to either human or murine GM-CSF. Using a double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TSF preparations were found to contain 36 +/- 4 U of hGM-CSF per picogram of TSF protein. These findings indicate that hGM-CSF is responsible for the megakaryocyte colony-promoting effects of TSF on human marrow cells in vitro.",M1
2684680,"Effects of thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor on terminal cytoplasmic maturation of human megakaryocytes.Aplastic anemia serum (AAS) contains humoral factors that alter both proliferation and maturation of human megakaryocytes (MK). The ability of AAS to augment MK colony formation (colony-forming unit, CFU-MK) was neutralized by an antiserum against MK colony-stimulating factor (MK-CSF), a glycoprotein isolated from AAS. The adsorbed AAS still retained the ability to accelerate cytoplasmic maturation of recognizable MK. Similar experiments were done with thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) and an anti-TSF antiserum to further define the activity in AAS responsible for accelerating cytoplasmic maturation. Bone marrow fractions enriched for recognizable human MK, but devoid of CFU-MK, were obtained by centrifugal elutriation and placed in short-term liquid cultures. MK progressed through identifiable maturation stages (1-4) more quickly in the presence of either TSF or AAS. TSF slightly enhanced the cloning efficiencies of CFU-MK, but did not alter the number of MK in individual colonies derived from non-adherent, low-density, T-cell-depleted bone marrow. In contrast, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and crude AAS substantially augmented both MK colony formation and cells per colony. TSF also doubled the percent 35S incorporation into platelets of immunothrombocythemic mice, but stimulation was completely abolished by anti-TSF. Anti-TSF antiserum was then used to analyze the promotion of MK colony formation by cytokines. Cloning efficiencies of CFU-MK were reduced to baseline values when TSF was pretreated with anti-TSF; however, the MK colony-stimulating activity (MK-CSA) of GM-CSF, IL-3, or AAS was not altered by adsorption with anti-TSF. In contrast, the cytoplasmic maturation of recognizable MK was slower, and fewer mature stage-4 cells were present at days 1-3 in AAS adsorbed with anti-TSF than MK cultured in AAS treated with normal rabbit serum or untreated AAS. Therefore, TSF appears to be a major factor in AAS that accelerates terminal maturation of human MK. TSF primarily affects megakaryocytopoiesis by promoting MK maturation rather than enhancing CFU-MK proliferation.",M1
2767181,"A four-step procedure for the purification of thrombopoietin.The present work reports the preparation of a highly bioactive and stable thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) by a four-step purification procedure, i.e., Sephadex column chromatography, ethanol precipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight (MW) of the purified product depended upon the method of purification, i.e., using denaturing buffers at 56 degrees C for 10 min, the MW was approximately 30,000 daltons; whereas, after preparing in denaturing buffers and heating to 100 degrees C for 10 min, the purified protein had an apparent MW of approximately 15 kd. Both moieties had significant biological activity. The data indicate that TSF may exist normally as a dimer (30 kd), but can disassociate to 15 kd without loss of bioactivity. The present work illustrates that the purified TSF has an isoelectric pH of 4.47 and exists in trace amounts in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell culture media. The final product prepared in the presence of Tween-20 had a specific activity of approximately 21,000 U of TSF per mg of protein, representing a purification factor of approximately 164,000. Using this four-step purification procedure, a homogeneous product was obtained as judged by SDS-PAGE and chromatofocusing. This purified material will be suitable for further studies, including amino acid sequencing.",M1
3261250,"Comparative effects of thrombopoietic-stimulatory factor and spleen cell-conditioned medium on megakaryocytopoiesis in a short-term bone marrow liquid culture system.The effect of partially purified thrombopoietic stimulatory factor (<e>TSF</e>) on megakaryocytopoiesis was studied using the soft-gel colony-forming assay and a short-term marrow liquid culture system (STLC) and compared to the effects of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity present in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium (PWCM). Nonadherent cells from STLC were sampled daily for acetylcholinesterase-positive cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-M). CFU-M were assayed in the soft-gel colony-forming system using PWCM as a source of colony-stimulating activity. Proliferative capacity of CFU-M obtained from liquid culture was determined from megakaryocyte colony size (number of megakaryocytes per colony) following plating of cells in a secondary colony-forming assay. Megakaryocytes were grouped into four maturation classes and megakaryocyte diameter was determined on acetylcholinesterase-stained cytocentrifuged cells using an eye-piece micrometer. TSF produced no CFU-M-derived colonies in the soft-gel colony-forming assay. Addition of TSF to STLC had no effect on the total number of CFU-M, megakaryocyte colony size, or total number of megakaryocytes compared to unstimulated STLC. However, on days 4-9 there was a significant increase in megakaryocyte diameter and the proportion of mature (stage III, IV) megakaryocytes obtained from TSF containing STLC compared to unstimulated STLC. In contrast, 5 days after addition of PWCM to STLC a sixfold increase in the total number of CFU-M per flask and a threefold increase in megakaryocytes was observed compared to unstimulated STLC. However, megakaryocyte colony size and megakaryocyte size were significantly reduced and a greater number of immature (stage I, II) megakaryocytes were present in STLC containing PWCM compared to unstimulated STLC. These results indicate that TSF accelerates the maturation of megakaryocytes in vitro and that a factor or factors present in spleen cell-conditioned medium, in addition to influencing megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation, also affect(s) megakaryocyte size.",M1
2453373,"Effect of recombinant and purified hematopoietic growth factors on human megakaryocyte colony formation.The effect of a number of purified or recombinant hematopoietic growth factors, including recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), thrombocytopoiesis stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>), recombinant interleukin 1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha), recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1), recombinant interleukin 3 (rIL-3), and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), on megakaryocyte (MK) colony formation by normal human marrow cells in a serum-depleted assay system was determined. Neither rEpo, TSF, CSF-1, rIL-1 alpha, nor rG-CSF alone augmented MK colony formation. Both rGM-CSF and rIL-3 at optimal doses increased MK colony formation eightfold and tenfold, respectively, above baseline values. Addition of increasing amounts of either rGM-CSF or rIL-3 led to progressively greater numbers of MK colonies formed until plateau levels were reached. Both rGM-CSF and rIL-3 also led to a dose-related increase in the number of cells per MK colony formed in culture. These molecules were equivalent stimulators of MK colony formation when their effects at optimal concentrations were compared. The effects of rGM-CSF and rIL-3 were additive at suboptimal concentrations of rIL-3 in that colony formation by a combination of the two growth factors approximated the sum of colony formation by each growth factor alone. These data suggest that rGM-CSF and rIL-3 alone and in combination are important regulators of in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis at the progenitor cell level.",M1
3595770,"High doses of recombinant erythropoietin stimulate platelet production in mice.Previously, recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo) was shown to increase the number and size of megakaryocytic colonies in vitro, and in vivo it elevates the number of megakaryocytes in mouse spleens. To test the hypothesis that rEpo would stimulate platelet production in mice, both normal mice and mice in rebound-thrombocytosis were injected with rEpo and the %35S incorporation into platelets was measured. A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) was used as a positive control. rEpo increased isotopic incorporation into platelets of both normal mice and mice in rebound-thrombocytosis, as did TSF, but required large doses (15 U rEpo/mouse). In other mice, hematocrits, platelet counts, platelet sizes, and 24-hr %35S incorporation into platelets were measured 2 days after injection of two equally divided doses of either rEpo or TSF. Significant increases in both platelet sizes and %35S incorporation into platelets were found after injections of 15 U rEpo/mouse or 2.3 U TSF/mouse. These data indicate that rEpo, at high doses, will stimulate platelet production in mice, and may suggest molecular similarities between rEpo and TSF and their ability to compete for common receptor sites on megakaryocytes and their progenitor cells.",M1
3606894,"Recovery of thrombopoietin during purification.A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) was previously purified by a six-step purification procedure. However, the exact quantity of TSF that was recovered, through the various purification procedures, was unknown because of the absence of a method for establishing a unit of measure of TSF. In the present work dose-response relationships on both the crude TSF preparations and on the more highly purified TSF were determined. TSF units were calculated from the dose-response curves. A unit of TSF is defined as the amount of material (mg) that is required to increase the percentages 35S incorporation into platelets of immunothrombocythemic mice by 50% above the baseline. The results of determining the TSF units on the crude TSF preparation indicated that 0.11 unit (U) of TSF/mg protein was present. Results showed that the specific activity of TSF can be increased to about 3.6 U/mg by a single purification procedure using Sephadex G-75 column chromatography. Increased specific activities were obtained by additional purification steps, i.e., DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, SE-HPLC, DEAE-HPLC, and SDS-PAGE. The purified product appears to have a specific activity of about 11,000 U/mg of protein with 0.00003% of the protein and 1.1% of the TSF recovered from the starting material. Establishing a unit of measure for TSF will allow calculations of its degree of purity, provide a method for quantitation of recoveries of activities after various purification procedures, and allow comparisons of results from different experiments and different laboratories.",M1
3322129,"Regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis by thrombopoietin.It is clear that thrombopoietin is a major hormonal regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis both in vitro and in vivo, and, thus, blood platelet production. Existing data show that the action, chemical nature, and immunologic properties of thrombopoietin from HEK cell culture medium and either endogenously produced or exogenously administered thrombopoietin from animal sources are similar, if not identical. Absolute identity, however, will require comparisons of amino acid sequences of the two preparations. Recent studies have shown that not only does <e>TSF</e> potentiate the action of meg-CSF, but it also has a direct effect on precursor cells to increase the number of megakaryocytic colonies. Other in vitro work showed that TSF stimulates directly the SAChE+ precursor cells to become mature megakaryocytes and causes FMLC to differentiate into megakaryocytic colonies. In vivo, TSF increases megakaryocyte size and number, it causes an elevation in the number of the SAChE+ precursor cells in mouse marrow and increases the maturation of megakaryocytes. Moreover, TSF increases the endomitosis of megakaryocytes in the marrow of mice, along with elevating the number of megakaryocytic colonies in spleens of lethally irradiated bone marrow reconstituted mice. Platelet production is also stimulated in mice by TSF as evidenced by elevated isotopic incorporation into platelets; it increases platelet sizes, and when administered in high doses TSF elevates platelet counts. Full development of colonies of megakaryocytes may depend on two growth factors. It has been hypothesized that one factor, meg-CSF, is effective in clonal expansion whereas a second factor is predominately involved in the endomitotic phase of megakaryocyte development. Multifactoral regulation has been observed for the other cell lineages, and a general proposal for hematopoietic development has been outlined by Iscove. In this scheme, specificity of erythropoietin to erythroid cell lineage is indicated. Previous work, however, shows that recombinant erythropoietin can act as a meg-CSF stimulus, indicating that much is yet to be learned about the action of hematopoietic regulatory factors. Although the present study showed that TSF may in some circumstances stimulate an early cell in the megakaryocytic series, its major effect is probably on the more differentiated population, leading to maturation of megakaryocytes and platelet production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1
3743681,"Comparison of stereologic techniques for the quantification of megakaryocyte size and number.This work describes the relationship between megakaryocyte size and number in bone marrow, based on stereologic theory, and compares methods of megakaryocyte quantitation from bone marrow sections. Mice were assigned to four treatment groups and received a single injection of either saline (S), thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>), normal rabbit serum (NRS), or rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS). Nine mice from each group were killed daily for three days, and one femur was removed from each mouse and sections prepared for light microscopy. Megakaryocytes were quantified using two general methods. In method 1, diameters of megakaryocyte section profiles were estimated from measurements of cell perimeter, major and minor axes, and profile area. Profile-size distributions, corrected for errors due to section thickness and optically lost profiles, were used to calculate mean megakaryocyte diameter (D). Megakaryocyte diameter and an estimate of the number of profiles per unit section area (NA) were used to calculate the number of megakaryocytes per unit volume (NV) of bone marrow. In method 2, estimates of the cell volume fraction and NA were used to calculate megakaryocyte NV and D. All calculations were made in accordance with the principles of stereology, a branch of morphometry based on geometric probability. Both methods provided satisfactory precision in estimating megakaryocyte D and NV. In general, cell D and NV were unchanged in S- and NRS-treated mice and were significantly greater after TSF and RAMPS treatment. This study confirms the biological effects of RAMPS and TSF on megakaryocytes and presents practical, precise methods by which megakaryocytes can be quantified from bone marrow sections.",M1
3703869,"Monoclonal antibodies to human urinary thrombopoietin.Monoclonal antibodies (MA) to a thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) were obtained from hybridomas derived from the fusion of P3 X 63/Ag 8 cells and spleen cells from TSF-immunized BALB/c mice. The immunizing protein was a partially purified TSF-rich preparation from the urine of a thrombocytopenic patient, and was shown to stimulate platelet production in rebound-thrombocytotic mice; i.e., platelet counts of recipient mice were increased to 133% of control and the values for percentage 35S incorporation into platelets were elevated to 225% of control. Media from several hybrid cultures were tested in a microantibody detection technique that measured the binding of MA to a 125I-purified TSF preparation from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The immune complex was precipitated by the addition of goat anti-mouse IgG serum and centrifugation. One clone gave 25% binding of 125I-TSF after a sevenfold dilution of the medium. This cell line was recloned and four of the subclones produced MA that gave even greater binding capacities. Hybridized cells were injected into  pristane-primed  mice and the antibodies produced in the ascites fluid were also shown to bind the 125I-TSF. Compared to the results of normal mouse serum, ascites fluid containing MA was shown to bind the unlabeled TSF from HEK cells. The TSF activity was significantly reduced in the supernatant fluid after precipitating the TSF-anti-TSF immune complex by a second antibody when tested in an immunothrombocythemic mouse assay. After SDS-PAGE, the precipitate from this TSF-MA conjugate showed that the antiserum bound a single 32,000 mol wt component, indicating the monospecificity of the MA. MA directed toward human TSF will allow studies that were not previously possible.",M1
3697428,"Thrombopoietic activity in newborn infants.Platelet count and thrombopoietic activity were investigated in newborns and in infants during their first 4 months of life. Four-day-old newborns, although not thrombocytopenic, showed a significantly reduced platelet count as compared to that of control adults. Furthermore, a significantly lower thrombopoietic activity was found in the sera of newborns compared to that in the sera of adults. In addition, the thrombopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) activity in cord serum was significantly lower than that in the mothers' sera. Since 7 of 37 newborns examined in the present study showed a very low TSF activity, lower than that found in the saline controls, the possibility that an inhibitor for thrombopoiesis exists in the newborns is suggested and discussed. The follow-up study revealed a low TSF activity in the sera of 1-month-old infants followed by a gradually increased activity, reaching in the 4th month levels similar to those of adults. Concomitantly with the rise in TSF activity in the serum, an increased platelet count was observed.",M1
4084458,"Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia with 3q inversion and elevated thrombopoietin (<e>TSF</e>): an autocrine role for TSF?A patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia is described in whom exactly the same paracentric inversion of 3q was detected as in three previously documented cases. The patient's serum thrombopoietin (TSF) was significantly raised. Based on these findings we postulate a role for a gene (? oncogene) on chromosome 3q in thrombopoietin production. Abnormalities of 3q may assist in delineating a subgroup of acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia, namely acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia.",M1
4034534,"Effect of thrombopoietin on in vitro production of megakaryocytes from fetal mouse liver cells.Plasma clots containing fetal mouse liver cells (FMLC) were used to study the effects of a thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) from kidney cell culture medium on the proliferation and maturation of megakarocytes. Cells in the megakaryocytic series were identified by the presence of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and by their morphological and ultrastructural characteristics. For these experiments, 1 X 10(3) to 1 X 10(5) FMLC were cultured for 1-7 days with 0-5 micrograms of TSF; control cultures were treated with production medium (PMC) in which kidney cells had not been grown. The number of AChE+ cells that were observed depended upon the number of cells plated, i.e., after 6 days of culture with 5 micrograms of TSF, an average of 187 AChE+ cells was found after plating 1 X 10(4) cells and 1020 AChE+ cells were observed after plating 1 X 10(5) cells. In dose-response experiments, the number of AChE+ cells rose with increasing doses of TSF. Significantly elevated numbers of AChE+ cells were observed after the addition of 1-5 micrograms of TSF. The optimum time of culture, based upon the number of AChE+ cells found, was 3-5 days. Ultrastructural analysis of megakaryocytes in plasma clots showed evidence of platelet shedding on Day 5. After the culture of FMLC with TSF, a larger number of AChE+ cells was formed from a given number of cells plated than in previous studies that used adult bone marrow cells. Therefore, because of its greater sensitivity, FMLC may be useful for the assay of low levels of TSF, and may be a valuable tool for studying the effects of megakaryocytic regulatory factors on megakaryocytopoiesis.",M1
4020244,"Studies on the purification of thrombopoietin from kidney cell culture medium.A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) has been purified from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell culture medium. In the initial purification step, crude HEK cell culture medium was fractionated with saturated ammonium sulfate (step I). The proteins precipitated by 40% to 60% and 60% to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation increased the percent of sulfur 35 incorporation into platelets of assay mice (P less than 0.01). The ammonium sulfate-precipitated proteins that contained significant TSF activity were further refined on Sephadex G-75 columns (step II). The fraction containing the highest specific activity (greatest 35S incorporation into platelets of assay mice per milligram of protein) was further purified by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column chromatography (step III). TSF activity was eluted from the columns between 0.3 and 1.0 mol/L NaCl. Additional Sephadex chromatography of post-DEAE-chromatographic preparations further increased the purity of the TSF (step IV). TSF from this four-step procedure was further processed on a DEAE-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (step Va) or size exclusion (SE)-HPLC columns (step Vb). After HPLC, the activity was localized in a region corresponding to a retention time of 6 to 8 minutes for the DEAE-HPLC, but longer times were found after SE-HPLC. TSF was further purified by additional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SE-HPLC (step VI). The final product had significant TSF activity and represented a purification of approximately 500,000-fold. It was also shown that the isoelectric pH of partially purified TSF was 4.7 and the molecular weight of the more highly purified preparation was approximately 32,000. After extraction by a combination of chromatographic procedures, a single homogeneous product was obtained.",M1
4012668,"Thrombopoietin production in a patient with chronic thrombocytopenia after plasma infusion.A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) was found to be significantly elevated in sera of a patient with chronic thrombocytopenia at one hour after infusion with fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). No detectable levels of TSF were found in the pre-infusion sera or in the infusate. At 2 hours post-infusion, TSF levels were decreased, and by 24 hrs the TSF titers were undetectable. Not only did FFP elevate TSF levels, but 6 days later significant increases in platelet counts were observed. This work confirms a previous finding of increased TSF levels following plasma infusion in a patient with similar clinical features and suggests that these patients lack a plasma factor that plays a critical role in TSF production.",M1
4029165,"Isolation of mouse megakaryocytes. I. Separation of two fractions enriched in different maturational stages.Megakaryocytes (MK) were isolated from mouse bone marrow by centrifugation on discontinuous gradients of isotonic albumin or Percoll and characterized by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining. The apparent density distributions of MK varied greatly depending upon the nature of the gradient medium and the composition of the cell suspension buffer while the density range of the other bone marrow cells remained largely unchanged. The present findings also indicate that the unusual morphological and functional characteristics of MK may underlie the observed shift in their density profile. Thrombocytopoietic stimulatory factor (<e>TSF</e>) was administered to mice 18 h before killing to elevate the normally low numbers of earlier MK in the bone marrow and to improve the yield of immature MK during the subsequent isolation procedure. Cells belonging to earlier stages in maturation were separated from the more mature ones on discontinuous Percoll density gradients, providing a basis for further investigation of MK development.",M1

For controls, other mice were injected with saline, normal rabbit serum (NRS), or rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS). Both TSF and RAMPS caused significant (P less than 0.0005) increases in the number and diameter of marrow megakaryocytes 2-3 days later. Increases in average megakaryocyte number per high-powered field ranged from 30-191%, while increases in average megakaryocyte diameter in the same mice ranged from 17-45%. After applying the multiple counting correction factor, increases of 6-100% in the number of megakaryocytes were observed. Although the mice injected with RAMPS, to make them thrombocytopenic, showed greater increases in marrow megakaryocyte numbers and sizes than mice injected with TSF, the results demonstrate that TSF from kidney cell cultures stimulated megakaryocytopoiesis.",M1

Cord serum was tested for erythropoietin (ESF) and thrombopoietin (<e>TSF</e>) activity. The same investigations were performed on venous blood and serum from 18 healthy adult individuals. SGA infants had higher haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit level (p less than 0.05), and lower platelet count (p less than 0.001) than AGA infants. Significant ESF activity was present in cord serum, but was not detectable in serum from adults. Significant TSF activity was present in cord serum as well as in serum from adults, with higher levels in the newborn infants (p less than 0.05). An inverse relationship was found between serum TSF activity and the number of platelets in adults, which was not demonstrable in newborn infants. Long-term intrauterine hypoxia because of placental dysfunction may be the reason for polycythemia and thrombocytopenia in SGA infants. Thrombocytopenia may be caused by competitive mechanisms on common stem cells for erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis, shunting stem cells in direction of erythropoiesis during hypoxic exposure. Normal serum TSF activity in SGA infants indicates that lack of the humoral factor for platelet production is not the reason for the thrombocytopenia in these infants. A negative feed-back mechanism may exist between platelet number and TSF production.",M1
6981521,"Comparative effects of thrombopoietin and colony-stimulating factors.The possible relationships between thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factors (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) and colony-stimulating factors (CSF) were studied. Various CSF-rich preparations and two lots of TSF-rich human embryonic kidney cell culture medium were tested for their ability to stimulate 35S incorporation into platelets of immunothrombocythemic mice. The TSF-rich culture medium produced linear dose-responses between the amount of medium injected and the level of 35S incorporation into platelets of assay mice. Thirteen CSF-rich preparations were used in three separate experiments; the results indicated a lack of correlation (r = 0.003) between CSF activity and the ability of these preparations to stimulate 35S incorporation into platelets of assay mice. Moreover, purified L-cell CSF was inactive in the TSF assay. When the colony stimulating activity in preparations rich in TSF were neutralized with anti-CSF serum, the material's ability to stimulate platelet production in mice was not affected. Based on these results, we conclude that TSF and CSF are separate entities.",M1

For controls, other mice were injected with normal rabbit serum or saline. All materials were given as single intraperitoneal injections; at frequent intervals of up to seven days the mice were killed. RAMPS caused severe thrombocytopenia in mice with significant rebound-thrombocytosis following five to seven days later. TSF did not significantly increase platelet counts of mice. Both RAMPS and TSF increased the proportion of the small acetylcholinesterase positive (SAChE+) cells in the marrow of mice which was elevated 3-fold above control values at 8-10 h after treatment. The percentage of SAChE+ cells returned to control levels by 48 h and to below control values by 64-168 h. These data indicate that both exogenous TSF and endogenously produced TSF released in response to acute thrombocytopenia caused a transitory increase in the percentage of SAChE+ cells in mice.",M1
7227478,"Characterization of a thrombocytopoietic-stimulating factor from kidney cell culture medium.The chemical characteristics of a thrombocytopoietic-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e> or thrombopoietin) found in serum-free kidney cell culture medium were further delineated by subjecting the TSF-rich medium to varying temperatures, different pH, and trypsin digested; the ability of TSF to bind lectins on affinity chromatography was also determined. After treatment, the TSF was assayed in immunothrombocythemic mice by its ability to increase the incorporation of 35S-sodium sulfate into newly formed platelets. TSF appeared to be relatively heat stable; incubation of TSF for 16 h at temperatures of 4, 37, and 56 degrees C showed no loss of TSF activity. However, after incubation at 85 degrees C, TSF was completely inactivated TSF in culture medium was stable of pH 1-8. Above these pH values, the potency of the TSF material decreased sharply. Digestion of TSF with trypsin completely destroyed the thrombocytopoietic-stimulating activity. For TSF purification, two different lectin-agarose derivatives were used; i.e., wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A (Con A). Both lectins bound TSF, and the hormone was eluted by the sugars specific for the particular lectin. lectins, therefore, can be used to partially purify the hormone; a further 10 to 200-fold purification was achieved by these techniques. Since other workers have shown that TSF from plasma of thrombocytopenic rabbits will bind WGA and Con A, TSF from kidney cell culture medium and TSF from animal sources appear to have similar carbohydrate compositions.",M1

Erythropoietin (EPO) from sheep plasma (6 units/mg protein) in doses from 1 to 5 units/ml induced a linear increase in CFUm to a maximum of 20 colonies/10(5) cells plated. Human urinary EPO also induced a dose-responsive increase in CFUm, but the maximum was 9 colonies/10(5) with 2.0 units/ml of EPO and there was a decrease in colonies above that concentration. Thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) derived from human embryonic kidney culture supernatant fluids induced a dose-responsive increase in CFUm in concentrations from 0.01 to 0.32 mg protein/ml in the absence of added EPO. TSF did not support the growth in vitro of erythroid colonies from mouse marrow (CFUe and BFUe) indicating the absence of EPO activity. In these studies sheep EPO appeared more effective in supporting CFUe growth than human EPO. TSF also had a stimulatory function in megakaryocyte differentiation at a precursor level.

In an attempt to clarify this discrepancy, mice were injected with potent TSF preparations and at daily intervals thereafter platelet sizes and % 35S incorporation into platelets were measured. TSF caused a substantial and significant increase in platelet sizes of recipient mice along with an elevated 35S uptake by platelets. The time of increased platelet size agreed with the time of elevated 35S incorporation into platelets, ie.e., both measurements showed the greatest response on day 2 after TSF injections; decreasing values were observed thereafter.",M1
488187,"Assay for thrombopoietin: a comparison of time of isotope incorporation into platelets and the effects of different strains and sexes of mice.Several workers have used mice for thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) assays, but the methods have differed. In quest of the optimum TSF assay conditions, we investigated the effects of interval between isotope injection and measurement of 35S incorporation into platelets, different mouse strains and sexes of mice. The 35S incorporation into platelets of mice increased with increase of the interval after isotope injection. However, the greatest difference in radioactivity between control and TSF-injected mice occurred at 16-40 h for normal mice and 24 h for rebound-thrombocytotic mice. When C3H, BALB/c or B6D2F1 mice were injected with platelet specific antisera, similar degrees of thrombocytopenia and rebound-thrombocytosis occurred. After injection of a standard dose of TSF, C3H and B6D2F1 mice showed greater isotopic incorporation levels, compared to suitable controls, than did BALB/c mice. Female and male mice exhibited essentially the same response to a standard dose of TSF. The data show that the mouse strain and isotopic incorporation time influence the sensitivity of the TSF assay but sex of test animals does not.",M1

Levels of TSF were assayed in thrombocythemic mice, using Na235SO4 uptake. RAMPS produced an immediate, severe thrombocytopenia without altering RBC or WBC counts of mice. Plasma collected from mice 4 hours after RAMPS injection increased both 35S incorporation into platelets (170% of control, P less than 0.005) and platelet counts (P less than 0.025) of TSF-assay mice. Although severe thrombocytopenia persisted, plasma TSF levels decreased thereafter, i.e., 111% of control after 8 hours and 99% of control after 16 hours. Platelet counts in mice exposed to 750 R and 900 R x-rays progressively decreased to severe thrombocytopenia by day 7, but almost normal RBC counts were maintained. Sera or plasma from animals with x-ray-induced thrombocytopenia caused significant increases in 35S incorporation into platelets of TSF-assay mice (196% of control, P less than 0.005 after 750 R and 141% of control, P less than 0.025 after 900 R).

In mice injected with rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS) average platelet size was shown to be increased as mice were recovering from thrombocytopenia. Also, 35S-measurements on platelets of these mice showed significant increases in cpm/average platelet 2-4 days after RAMPS treatment. Significant increases in 35S-incorporation into the total circulating mass of platelets were found on days 3-4. In normal mice or mice in rebound-thrombocytosis injected with thrombopoietin, platelet size remained unchanged, whereas the platelet cound and 35S-incorporation into platelets were shown to be significantly increased. Moreover, a dose-response experiment in mice pretreated with RAMPS showed a slight increase in platelet count as the dose of <e>TSF</e> was increased, but platelet sizes were unaltered. The % 35S-incorporation into platelets showed a significant linear dose-response, i.e. as the dose of thrombopoietin was increased, as increase in % 35S-incorporation into platelets was observed. These data indicated that of the three indirect measurements of thrombopoietin, the % 35S-incorporation into mouse platelets was the most sensitive, followed by platelet counting; the least sensitive measurement of thrombopoiesis was change in platelet size.",M1

In immunothrombocythaemic mice, the amount of 35S incorporation into the platelet mass after injections of a standard dose of TSF was related to the length of time after rabbit anti-mouse platelet serum (RAMPS) injection. After 2 platelet transfusions, however, there was no decrease in 35S incorporation values of mice with time after injections of control or TSF-containing substances. When platelet counts were made 3 days after the last platelet transfusion, the counts decreased with the number of transfusions. Mice in rebound-thrombocytosis were responsive to TSF as evidenced by higher platelet counts (P less than 0.05) and increased 35S incorporation into platelets (P less than 0.005), whereas mice made thrombocytotic by platelet transfusions were not. Assuming that increased platelet counts induced by the different techniques affect assay mice only by inhibiting blood cell production by haematopoietic cells, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that sensitivity to TSF depends upon the proliferative state of the megakaryocytic precursor population.",M1

Mode of action of T-cell-suppressor factor(s) and interaction with cytokines.The mode of action of T-cell-suppressor factor (<e>TsF</e>) induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) preirradiation in terms of interaction with several cytokines was studied. Suppression of murine contact photosensitivity (CPS) to 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA) by preirradiation of the sensitizing site to low doses of UVB was caused by antigen-specific suppressor T cells (Ts) and was not associated with the generation of efferent limb-acting suppressor cells. TsF released by Ts inhibited the proliferation of immune lymph node (LN) cells in vitro and reduced interleukin (IL)-2 production of these cells in an antigen-specific fashion without affecting the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression. Both rIL-2 and rGM-CSF have the ability to restore CPS responses in the UVB-preirradiated mice when administered after but not before photosensitization. However, rIL-2 but not rGM-CSF counteracted the in vivo inhibitory effect of TsF. rGM-CSF did not affect the density of I-A+ epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs). It was suggested that TsF inhibited IL-2-mediated immune T-cell proliferation, while rGM-CSF reconstituted the CPS by enhancing the function of photodamaged LCs. These results indicate multiple steps of the UVB-induced immunosuppression circuit, each of which seems to be controlled by different immunomodulators.",M2

A member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family, G-TsF is identical to TGF beta 2. The present study investigated the effect of G-TsF/TGF beta 2 on the proliferative and cytotoxic properties of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL's) isolated from malignant gliomas after expansion in vitro with interleukin-2 (IL-2). The results demonstrate that the IL-2 (5 to 20 U/ml)-dependent proliferative response of glioma-derived TIL's was inhibited 70% to 85% by G-TsF/TGF beta 2 and that the inhibitory effect could be reduced by using increasing concentrations of IL-2 (100 to 200 U/ml). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) enhanced the IL-2-dependent proliferation of TIL's cultured in low concentrations of IL-2 (10 U/ml); however, neither TNF alpha nor interferon gamma was able to reduce the inhibitory effect of TGF beta 2 on TIL proliferation.

IL-2 has no effect on the cell growth of these hybridomas and little overall effect is observed on protein biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the addition of IL-2 to one of these hybridomas (762 B3.7), leads to a substantial increase in suppressor factor (TsF2) production as measured by both bioactivity and direct analysis of 35S-methionine incorporation into TsF2. Treatment of the TsF2 producing hybridoma with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) causes an increase in the level of IL-2 receptor expression in this hybridoma and enhances the effects of IL-2 on the biosynthesis of TsF2. These data suggest that in addition to its growth promoting properties, IL-2 may provide a signal that triggers suppressor cells to produce antigen specific suppressor factors.",M2

The G-TsF is a novel member of the transforming growth factor beta family and is identical to TGF beta 2. The effect of G-TsF and TGF beta 2 on the induction of LAK cell activity was investigated by culturing PBL obtained from normal blood donors and brain tumour patients in varying concentrations (50-500 U/ml) of interleukin 2 (IL2) alone or IL2 plus G-TsF/TGF beta 2 (1 ng/ml) for 4 days. Subsequent cytolytic activity was measured against autologous and allogeneic glioblastoma targets, fresh NK-resistant melanoma cells and K562 cells. G-TsF/TGF beta 2 purified from glioblastoma cell cultures and TGF beta 2 isolated from porcine platelets significantly suppressed the generation of LAK cell activity, and the inhibitory effect could be reduced by higher concentrations of IL2. The suppressive effect of TGF beta 2 was most significant during the early stages of LAK cell generation and no inhibitory effect was seen when TGF beta 2 was added directly to the cytotoxicity assay.

Recently, purification and cloning of G-TsF revealed that G-TsF is identical to transforming growth factor-beta 2. As shown here, G-TsF suppresses the growth of an ovalbumin-specific mouse T helper cell clone (OVA-7T) independently of the stimulus used being either (a) antigen in the presence of antigen-presenting cells, or (b) interleukin 2 (IL2) or (c) phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. Furthermore, in the presence of antibodies against IL2 receptors, G-TsF was able to suppress the residual proliferation still observed when OVA-7T were stimulated with phorbol ester/ionophore. G-TsF failed to inhibit the release of IL3 from OVA-7T activated with IL2. Taken together, the data provide evidence that G-TsF does not directly interfere with interactions of IL2 with its receptor but rather inhibits T cell activation by interfering with an as yet unidentified pathway used by both IL2 and phorbol ester/ionophore.

3128448,"Involvement of soluble mediator(s) different from interleukin (IL) 1 in the antigen-induced IL 2 receptor expression and proliferation of L3T4+ (CD4+) T lymphocytes.Proliferation of T lymphocytes (T cells) requires the interaction of interleukin 2 (IL 2) with the high affinity form of the IL 2 receptor (IL 2R). IL 2 production as well as IL 2R expression are generally induced simultaneously in T cells by the recognition of specific antigen displayed on the surface of syngeneic antigen-presenting cells. The experiments described herein show that the expression of IL 2R has different requirements than the production of IL 2 (and other lymphokines). Stimulation of antigen-specific L3T4+ T cell lines with antigen-pulsed spleen cells (SC) treated with ultraviolet (UV) light results in efficient IL 2 production but only minimal proliferation due to reduced IL 2R expression, as compared to T cells stimulated by antigen and SC without UV light treatment. The reduced IL 2R expression/proliferation correlates with the absence of a soluble mediator(s) termed T cell-stimulating factor (<e>TSF</e>) in the supernatants of T cells stimulated with antigen-pulsed, UV light-irradiated SC. Addition of TSF of these T cells could at least partially restore the proliferative response or enhance IL 2R expression. Because TSF is present in the supernatant of T cells triggered by antigen and SC but is absent when the latter are UV light treated, we suggest that TSF is a product of metabolically active splenic antigen-presenting cells.

Antigen-independent proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL2)-receptor expression occur in the presence of splenic accessory cells, exogenous IL2 and a soluble factor(s) provisionally termed T cell-stimulating factor(s) (<e>TSF</e>). Each of these components is essential for inducing growth. TSF is found in the supernatant of an autoreactive T cell line upon stimulation with syngeneic accessory cells.

2949861,"The suppressor T cell induced by syngeneic splenic cell antigen down-regulates hapten-specific cytotoxic T cells by elaborating a factor inhibitory for IL2-dependent cell replication.An in vitro study has been made of the mechanism by which a suppressor T cell, that is induced in lymph nodes by a syngeneic splenic cell antigen, prevents generation of cytotoxic T cells specific for hapten-altered self antigens. When popliteal lymph node cells exposed in vivo to syngeneic splenic cells were immunized in vitro with heat-treated syngeneic TNP-coupled thymocytes and excess helper factors, the Ts remained inactive. In this condition the exposed popliteal lymph node cells routinely demonstrated approximately twice the CTL response developed by lymph node cells from normal mice. Nevertheless, when triggered in vitro by splenic antigen on either X-irradiated B or T cells, the exposed but not the normal lymph node cells exhibited reduced hapten-altered self-specific CTL responses. Furthermore, T cells within spleen cell-exposed popliteal lymph node cell populations when reexposed to splenic T cells made a factor that was found to be suppressive of CTL generation by normal lymph node cells in vitro. The nondialyzable T-cell suppressor factor (<e>TsF</e>) did not appear to act on lymph node precursor CTLs, nor on helper T cells but instead acted at the level of utilization of helper factors in the development of CTLs. In an examination of the effect of TsF on cellular replication, TsF was found to be nontoxic for CTLL-20, an IL-2-dependent T cell, and it did not hinder the uptake of IL-2 by receptor blockade of this cell. Nevertheless, the replication of CTLL-20 that is IL-2 driven was diminished in the presence of TsF. Similarly, TsF was found to be inhibitory for T-cell proliferation stimulated by mitogen but had no effect on a B myeloma cell proliferative response. Thus, TsF appears to act as an inhibitor of a T cell's capability to replicate despite the presence of the stimulus for replication, namely, IL-2.",M2
3025299,"Suppressor T cell growth and differentiation: evidence for induced receptors on suppressor T cells that bind a suppressor T cell differentiation factor.T suppressor cell differentiation factor (TsDF) induces the differentiation of alloantigen-primed suppressor T cells (MLR-Ts) to expression of their effector function, i.e., to active <e>TsF</e> production. The initial activation stimulus to Ts is provided by alloantigen binding; after this binding, Ts are functionally responsive only for a period of hours to the additional stimulus provided by TsDF. The present studies addressed the possibility that MLR-Ts responsiveness to TsDF reflects the induced and transient display of TsDF-binding receptors. TsDF receptor expression was investigated by determining the capacity of TsDF-responsive MLR-Ts to adsorb TsDF activity and to respond to that TsDF pulse by TsF production. Primed Ts populations that were alloantigen restimulated for 8 hr adsorbed TsDF in a cell dose-dependent fashion and produced TsF in response to that adsorption, whereas alloantigen-stimulated naive cells or primed but nonrestimulated cells neither responded to nor bound TsDF. Primed and restimulated L3T4-Ly-2+ but not L3T4+-Ly-2--enriched T cells bound TsDF. TsDF adsorption was saturable and time and temperature dependent. Glutaraldehyde fixation did not prevent TsDF adsorption by restimulated MLR-Ts, whereas pronase treatment abolished their TsDF-binding capacity. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that the capacity to bind TsDF developed rapidly after alloantigen reexposure, with maximal binding within 8 hr, followed by rapid decay with loss of TsDF binding by 36 hr. The kinetics of TsDF-induced TsF production correlated precisely with those of TsDF binding. These observations provide strong evidence that TsDF affects primed alloantigen-reactive Ts by interaction with antigen-induced and transiently expressed cell surface receptors. TsDF-receptor binding is then the stimulus for expression of Ts effector function.",M2
2946902,"Lymphokines regulate expression of cell surface antigens and production of suppressor factors by murine suppressor T cell hybridomas.Suppressor T cell hybridomas specific for L-glutamic acid 60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT) elaborate monoclonal suppressor factors (<e>TsF</e>) and bear surface markers such as H-2, I-J, and Thy-1 antigens. Over a period of years in culture, the production of TsF by such hybridomas has been constitutive and continuous; by contrast, the expression of surface markers has declined and some have been lost. The mixture of lymphokines in the supernatant fluid from concanavalin A-activated mixtures of allogeneic splenocytes (CAS) restored surface antigen expression, and the effective agents have been identified by using purified sources of lymphokines. Murine gamma interferon (IFN gamma) induced expression of H-2 class I antigens, but not I-J or Thy-1, in the hybridoma cells. Human interleukin 2 (IL-2) induced the increased expression of I-J and Thy-1 but not H-2 class I antigens. Interestingly, production of TsF was decreased by IFN gamma treatment but increased by IL-2, indicating some measure of regulation by lymphokines of the level of a protein that is constitutively produced.",M2
2939857,"An overview of T-suppressor cell circuits.This review gives an overview of two main suppressor circuits. In its complete form, the first circuit form has an early acting Ts-inducer that behaves like a T-helper cell for the production of idiotype-directed Ts-transducer or antigen-directed Ts-effector cells. In this circuit, the T-suppressor effector cell (Ts-eff) produces antigen-specific T-suppressor factor (<e>TsF</e>). This has a mode of action through the T-acceptor cell (T-acc), a cell that requires immunization, but not specific immunization, for its production. This cell, when armed with TsF-eff and then triggered with antigen and I-J, releases nonspecific TsF that blocks the passive transfer of contact sensitivity. It also blocks the production of IL-2. The biological significance of the complexities of this circuit is discussed in relation to the control of unresponsiveness and the handling infection and antigenic variation of microorganisms. The second set of suppressor cells, T suppressor afferent cells, inhibits only when given early in the immune response but differs from the Ts-inducer by lacking an obligatory mode of action through the Ts-eff/T-acc circuit. In general, the antigen-specific T-helper and T-suppressor factors have a two-chain disulfide-bonded structure. One chain carries the antigen-binding site and the other chain MHC-related determinants. Both chains are required for biological activity, and the genetic restriction in this complementation implies that the antigen-binding chain has a recognition site for MHC determinant(s). The generalization can be made that the MHC-related determinants carried by the factors and the genetic restriction in their induction, in their action, and in the interchain complementation between their separated chains all map to the same region of the genome. This is intelligible on the assumption that the T-cell receptor on the cell that produces the factor has a recognition site for antigen and MHC determinants and that the antigen-binding chain of secreted factor has the same properties.",M2
2582055,"Immunoregulation in the rat: characteristics of a suppressor T cell that inhibits antigen-dependent cell proliferation.We have examined the characteristics of a rat suppressor T cell (Ts) that inhibited the antigen-dependent proliferative response of antigen-primed T cells. The kinetics of in vitro induction of Ts from lymph node T cells obtained from antigen-primed rats indicated that Ts were induced in the presence of the priming antigen within 48 hr of culturing. The Ts produced during the first 48 hr of in vitro cultures were radiosensitive (2000 rad) but became partially radioresistant within the next 48 hr of culturing. In the presence but not the absence of priming antigen, Ts inhibited the antigen-dependent proliferative response to the priming antigen as well as to heterologous antigens. Suppression appeared to be mediated via a nondialyzable suppressor factor (<e>TsF</e>). The induction of Ts in cultures required the presence of OX-6-/OX-8- T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and the antigen. Although a majority of cells recovered from the induced cultures were OX-8+, there was no evidence that OX-8+ antigen expression per se was related to Ts activity. Addition of highly purified IL 2 augmented the Ts-mediated suppression. The immunoregulatory implications of these findings are discussed.",M2
6205081,"Characterization of an antigen-specific suppressive factor derived from a cloned suppressor effector T cell line.A cloned effector-type suppressor T cell line, 3D10, which is known to suppress the antibody response against dinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), produced a soluble KLH-specific factor (<e>TsF</e>) that can replace the function of parental T cell clones. High activity of TsF was released spontaneously into the culture supernatant when cultured in interleukin 2 (IL 2)-containing medium, requiring no antigenic stimulation. The culture supernatant of 3D10 was also capable of inhibiting the KLH-induced proliferative response of primed T cells in an antigen-specific manner. The direct target of TsF was found to be Lyt-1+2- T cells undergoing an early stage of antigen-specific proliferation. TsF was antigen binding but lacked any other serologic markers such as I-J and immunoglobulin heavy chain-linked allotypic determinants on T cells. No genetic restriction was found in its action on allogeneic T cells. The production of IL 2 in proliferative T cells by antigenic stimulation was not inhibited by TsF. These results indicate that the TsF described here is the legitimate mediator produced by the effector-type suppressor T cell that suppresses the antigen-specific responses of Lyt-1+2- T cells. The m.w. of TsF was approximately 75,000.",M2
6233362,"Tolerance to Mls-disparate cells induces suppressor T cells that act at the helper level to prevent in vivo generation of cytolytic lymphocytes to hapten-altered self.We have been examining the mechanisms that control in vivo development and down regulation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-altered self antigens. In vivo generation of hapten-specific CTL requires an auxiliary antigenic stimulus, which can be provided by H-2 compatible but Mls-disparate cells. These experiments were designed to study the effect of tolerization with such Mls-disparate cells on CTL development. C3H/HeN (H-2k, Mlsc ) mice sensitized in the footpads with C3H-TNP spleen cells plus CBA/J (H-2k, Mlsd ) spleen cells develop CTL in the draining lymph nodes that will lyse 51Cr-labeled TNP-modified C3H targets. However, we have found that if C3H/HeN mice are given tolerizing doses of CBA/J spleen cells 5 to 7 days before sensitization, a splenic suppressor T cell (Ts) appears. This Ts will suppress CTL development in its tolerant host, and can be transferred adoptively to function in naive mice. Ts and its precursor are cyclophosphamide insensitive and therefore different from the naturally existing suppressor cell present in mice. When triggered by cells with Mlsd , the Ts produces a factor (<e>TsF</e>) that hinders helper factors from functioning in an in vitro CTL assay. Furthermore, TsF acts to prevent utilization of IL 2 by an IL 2-dependent cell line. Thus, evidence has been provided that the in vivo generation of CTL toward hapten-altered self can be down regulated at the level of helper signals by a Ts. The latter is inducible by the Mls-disparate cells that are needed at a different site to trigger the helper factors in this CTL system.",M2
6201587,"Suppressor T cell growth and differentiation. Identification of a cofactor required for suppressor T cell function and distinct from interleukin 2.This report describes a Ts costimulator assay and its use to analyze cofactors required for the expression of suppressor T cell function. Activation of primed MLR-Ts (alloantigen-activated suppressor T cells suppressive of mixed leukocyte reaction) to suppressor T cell factor (<e>TsF</e>) production typically fails in the presence of glutaraldehyde-fixed rather than irradiated allogeneic stimulator cells. However, MLR-TsF production was restored by the addition of 48-h primary MLR supernates; MLR-derived Ts costimulator neither activated primed MLR-Ts in the absence of fixed allogeneic stimulators nor directly suppressed assay MLR. Lack of antigen specificity or genetic restriction and failure to activate unprimed MLR-Ts precursors suggested that Ts costimulator activity differed from previously described Ts inducer functions and was more closely aligned with the lymphocyte- or monocyte-derived interleukins (IL). Three findings distinguished Ts costimulator from IL-2. Depletion of IL-2 activity from MLR supernates by HT2 adsorption failed to affect Ts costimulator function. In addition, MLR supernates prepared in the presence of cyclosporin A contained no IL-2 but expressed Ts costimulator activity. Finally, gel chromatography demonstrated Ts costimulator in peaks of 21,000 and 43,000 mol wt that were largely distinct from the IL-2-containing fractions. Ts costimulator activity was also identified in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced EL4 supernates and was retained in those supernates after IL-2 depletion by HT2 adsorption. In preliminary functional characterization, MLR supernate-derived Ts costimulator triggered MLR-TsF production from irradiated MLR-Ts in the absence of proliferation. Thus a differentiative rather than proliferative stimulus required for primed MLR-Ts function appears to be provided by this Ts costimulator and has been provisionally termed Ts differentiative factor ( TsDF ). This initial characterization may thus identify one of a possibly distinctive family of interleukins required in the alloantigen-driven activation of suppressor T cells to effector function.",M2
6227676,"Suppressive mechanisms in alloantigen-induced T cell responses.In this report we examined the possibility that suppression of the mixed lymphocyte response by MLR-<e>TsF</e> results from interference with IL-2 regulation of T cell proliferation. Two distinct processes of inhibition involving both a direct effect on IL-2-driven proliferation of responder T cells, and induction of a second-order suppressor cell (Ts2) were described. Exogenous IL-2 did not abrogate MLR-TsF-induced suppression, and activated responder cells from suppressed cultures expressed functional IL-2 receptors by IL-2 adsorption analysis. Thus, suppression is not due to lack of available IL-2 or to abnormal acquisition of receptors for IL-2 during T cell activation. In contrast, a profound MLR-TsF effect on IL-2-induced proliferation of HT2 cells as well as MLR-activated cells was observed even after presaturation of receptors with excess IL-2. These results differentiated the direct responder cell effect of MLR-TsF from its Ts2 inductive capacity, and localized the defect in responder cell proliferation to events occurring subsequent to IL-2 binding. When analyzed in terms of proposed models for hormone-receptor interactions, characteristic dose-response curves similarly predict a postreceptor defect. Examination of the Ts2 pathway of suppression revealed a late-acting inhibitory effect peaking 72 h after MLR initiation. A minor part of Ts2 activity was susceptible to exogenous IL-2, and may reflect a requirement for IL-2 during Ts2 expansion. However, the most significant component of Ts2-mediated suppression was resistant to excess IL-2, and IL-2 production was normal in Ts2-regulated cultures, thus ruling out limitation of IL-2 for responder cell use as the major mechanism of Ts2 suppression. The complete pathway of Ts2 suppression and its functional relationship to other MLR-TsF inhibitory activities is not yet fully understood. However, these results suggest that the ultimate mechanisms of alloantigen-induced suppression involve late events of the IL-2-dependent lymphokine cascade.",M2
