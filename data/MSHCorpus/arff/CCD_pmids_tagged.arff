19303294,"Late-onset axial myopathy with cores due to a novel heterozygous dominant mutation in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene.Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been associated with a wide range of phenotypes including the malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility trait, Central Core Disease (<e>CCD</e>) and other congenital myopathies characterized by early onset and predominant proximal weakness. We report a patient presenting at 77 years with a predominant axial myopathy associated with prominent involvement of spine extensors, confirmed on MRI and muscle biopsy, compatible with a core myopathy. RYR1 mutational analysis revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.119G&gt;T; p.Gly40Val) affecting the RYR1 N-terminus, previously predominantly associated with MH susceptibility. This case expands the spectrum of RYR1-related phenotypes and suggests that MH-related RYR1 mutations may give rise to overt neuromuscular symptoms later in life, with clinical features not typically found in CCD due to C-terminal hotspot mutations. Late-onset congenital myopathies may be under-recognised and diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion.",M1
19206168,"alpha-Skeletal muscle actin mutants causing different congenital myopathies induce similar cytoskeletal defects in cell line cultures.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), congenital fibre type disproportion (CFTD), and nemaline myopathy (NM) are earlyonset clinically heterogeneous congenital myopathies, characterized by generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia. All three diseases are associated with alpha-skeletal muscle actin mutations. We biochemically characterized the CCD and CFTD causing actin mutants and show that all mutants fold correctly and are stable. Expression studies in fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myotubes show that these mutants incorporate in filamentous structures. However they do not intercalate between the nascent z-lines in differentiating muscle cell cultures. We also show that the distribution of mitochondria and of the ryanodine receptors, and calcium release properties from ryanodine receptors, are unchanged in myotubes expressing the CCD causing mutants. CFTD causing mutants induce partly similar phenotypes as NM associated ones, such as rods and thickened actin fibers in cell culture. Our results suggest that molecular mechanisms behind CFTD and NM may be partly related.",M1
19027160,"A recessive ryanodine receptor 1 mutation in a <e>CCD</e> patient increases channel activity.Ryanodine receptors plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling by releasing calcium ions required for muscle contraction from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. At least three phenotypes associated with more than 100 RYR1 mutations have been identified; in order to elucidate possible pathophysiological mechanisms of RYR1 mutations linked to neuromuscular disorders, it is essential to define the mutation class by studying the functional properties of channels harbouring clinically relevant amino acid substitutions. In the present report we investigated the functional effects of the c.7304G&gt;T RYR1 substitution (p.Arg2435Leu) found in a patient affected by central core disease. Both parents were heterozygous for the substitution while the proband was homozygous. We characterized Ca(2+) homeostasis in myoD transduced myotubes from controls, the heterozygous parents and the homozygous proband expressing the endogenous mutation. We also expressed the recombinant mutant channels in heterologous cells and characterized their [(3)H]ryanodine binding and single channel properties. Our results show that the p.Arg2435Leu substitution affects neither the resting [Ca(2+)], nor the sensitivity of the ryanodine receptor to pharmacological activators, but rather reduces the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores induced by pharmacological activators as well as by KCl via the voltage sensing dihydropyridine receptor.",M1
18313359,"Congenital muscle disorders with cores: the ryanodine receptor calcium channel paradigm.Dysregulation of calcium signals because of defects of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor; RyR1) is causative of several congenital muscle disorders including malignant hyperthermia (MH; MIM #145600), central core disease (<e>CCD</e>; MIM #11700), specific forms of multi-minicore disease (MmD; MIM # 255320) and centronuclear myopathy (CNM). Experimental data have shown that RYR1 mutations result mainly in four types of channel defects: one class of RYR1 mutations (MH) cause the channels to become hypersensitive to activation by electrical and pharmacological stimuli. The second class of RYR1 mutations (CCD) result in leaky channels leading to depletion of Ca(2+) from SR stores. A third class of RYR1 mutations linked to CCD causes excitation-contraction uncoupling, whereby activation of the voltage sensor Cav1.1 is unable to release calcium from the SR. The fourth class of mutations are unveiled by wild type allele silencing, and cause a decrease of mutant RyR1 channels expression on SR membranes. In this review, we discuss the classes of RYR1 mutations which have been associated with CCD, MmD and related neuromuscular phenotypes.",M1
17631035,"Multi-minicore Disease.Multi-minicore Disease (MmD) is a recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by multiple cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. Prevalence is unknown. Marked clinical variability corresponds to genetic heterogeneity: the most instantly recognizable classic phenotype characterized by spinal rigidity, early scoliosis and respiratory impairment is due to recessive mutations in the selenoprotein N (SEPN1) gene, whereas recessive mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been associated with a wider range of clinical features comprising external ophthalmoplegia, distal weakness and wasting or predominant hip girdle involvement resembling central core disease (<e>CCD</e>). In the latter forms, there may also be a histopathologic continuum with CCD due to dominant RYR1 mutations, reflecting the common genetic background. Pathogenetic mechanisms of RYR1-related MmD are currently not well understood, but likely to involve altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeoestasis; calcium-binding motifs within the selenoprotein N protein also suggest a possible role in calcium handling. The diagnosis of MmD is based on the presence of suggestive clinical features and multiple cores on muscle biopsy; muscle MRI may aid genetic testing as patterns of selective muscle involvement are distinct depending on the genetic background. Mutational analysis of the RYR1 or the SEPN1 gene may provide genetic confirmation of the diagnosis. Management is mainly supportive and has to address the risk of marked respiratory impairment in SEPN1-related MmD and the possibility of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in RYR1-related forms. In the majority of patients, weakness is static or only slowly progressive, with the degree of respiratory impairment being the most important prognostic factor.",M1
17504518,"Central core disease.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterised by central cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. Prevalence is unknown but the condition is probably more common than other congenital myopathies. CCD typically presents in infancy with hypotonia and motor developmental delay and is characterized by predominantly proximal weakness pronounced in the hip girdle; orthopaedic complications are common and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a frequent complication. CCD and MHS are allelic conditions both due to (predominantly dominant) mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, encoding the principal skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR1). Altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeostasis within muscle cells due to mutation-induced conformational changes of the RyR protein are considered the main pathogenetic mechanism(s). The diagnosis of CCD is based on the presence of suggestive clinical features and central cores on muscle biopsy; muscle MRI may show a characteristic pattern of selective muscle involvement and aid the diagnosis in cases with equivocal histopathological findings. Mutational analysis of the RYR1 gene may provide genetic confirmation of the diagnosis. Management is mainly supportive and has to anticipate susceptibility to potentially life-threatening reactions to general anaesthesia. Further evaluation of the underlying molecular mechanisms may provide the basis for future rational pharmacological treatment. In the majority of patients, weakness is static or only slowly progressive, with a favourable long-term outcome.",M1
17226826,"Central core disease due to recessive mutations in RYR1 gene: is it more common than described?Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal-dominant congenital myopathy, with muscle weakness and malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. We identified two of nine Brazilian CCD families carrying two mutations in the RYR1 gene. The heterozygous parents were clinically asymptomatic, and patients were mildly affected, differing from the few autosomal-recessive cases described previously. Recessive inheritance in CCD may therefore be more common than previously appreciated, which has important implications for genetic counseling and MH prevention in affected families.",M1
17204937,"Abnormal distribution of calcium-handling proteins: a novel distinctive marker in core myopathies.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) and multi-minicore disease (MmD) are muscle disorders characterized by foci of mitochondria depletion and sarcomere disorganization ( cores ) in muscle fibers. Although core myopathies are the most frequent congenital myopathies, their pathogenesis remains elusive and specific diagnostic markers are lacking. Core myopathies are mostly caused by mutations in 2 sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins: the massive Ca-release channel RyR1 or the selenoprotein N (SelN) of unknown function. To search for distinctive markers and to obtain further pathophysiological insight, we identified the molecular defects in 12 core myopathy patients and analyzed the immunolocalization of 6 proteins of the Ca-release complex in their muscle biopsies. In 7 cases with RYR1 mutations (6 CCD, one MmD), RyR1 was depleted from the cores; in contrast, the other proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calsequestrin, SERCA1/2, and triadin) and the T-tubule (dihydropyridine receptor-alpha1subunit) accumulated within or around the lesions, suggesting an original modification of the Ca-release complex protein arrangement. Conversely, all Ca-related proteins were distributed normally in 5 MmD cases with SelN mutations. Our results provide an appropriate tool to orientate the differential and molecular diagnosis of core myopathies and suggest that different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to core formation in SelN- and in RyR1-related core myopathies.",M1
17190947,"Muscle imaging in dominant core myopathies linked or unlinked to the ryanodine receptor 1 gene.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the muscle involvement of patients with central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) and to compare these findings with those from patients with core myopathies unlinked to the RYR1 gene. METHODS: We performed a systematic muscular imaging assessment in 11 patients with an RYR1 gene mutation and compared these findings with those of 5 patients from two unrelated families with autosomal dominant core myopathies not linked to RYR1, ACTA1, or MYH7 gene loci. RESULTS: All patients with RYR1 CCD had a characteristic pattern with predominant involvement of the gluteus maximus, adductor magnus, sartorius, vastus intermediolateralis, soleus, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. In contrast, muscle CT in the first family not linked to RYR1 showed predominant affection of the gluteus minimus and hamstring muscles, whereas the second family presented with predominant involvement of the gluteus minimus, vastus intermediolateralis, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius muscles. In addition to muscle imaging data, we present detailed information on the clinical and pathologic findings of these novel phenotypes of core myopathies not linked to RYR1. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest genetic heterogeneity in autosomal dominant core myopathies and the existence of additional unidentified genes.",M1
17081152,"Malignant hyperthermia and central core disease causative mutations in Swedish patients.BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility is a pharmacogenetic disorder of intracellular calcium homeostasis. In susceptible individuals, halogenated anaesthetics and/or suxamethonium may trigger an MH reaction. The diagnosis of MH susceptibility is made by an in vitro contracture test of biopsied muscle strips. METHODS: In 27 MH susceptible (MHS) probands and four MH negative (MHN) probands, exons 17, 39, 40, 45 and 46 of the RYR1 gene were screened for MH causative mutations. In addition, in three patients with established central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), exons 17, 39, 40, 45 and 46 and exons 95, 100, 101 and 102 were screened for MH and CCD causative mutations. All screenings were performed by direct sequencing of the entire exons. RESULTS: MH causative mutations were found in five of the 27 MHS probands (19%). CCD causative mutations were found in two of three CCD patients in the C-terminal exons. None of the CCD patients showed a mutation in N-terminal exon 17 or in the central exons. CONCLUSIONS: In a Swedish population, screening of N-terminal exon 17 and the central exons for MH causative mutations in the RYR1 gene covers 19% of families. Thus, other mutations must also be responsible for MH susceptibility in Sweden. Although the number of CCD patients in this study was small, screening of the C-terminal exons for CCD causative mutations seems to be a promising tool in the process of making a diagnosis.",M1
16958053,"Two central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) deletions in the C-terminal region of RYR1 alter muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling by distinct mechanisms.Central core disease (CCD) and malignant hyperthermia (MH) are skeletal muscle disorders that are linked to mutations in the gene that encodes the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1). The RYR1 ion channel plays a central role in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling by releasing Ca(2+) from an internal store. Pathogenic CCD mutations in RYR1 result in changes in the magnitude of Ca(2+) release during EC coupling. CCD has recently been linked to two novel deletions (c.12640_12648delCGCCAGTTC [p.Arg4214_Phe4216del] and c.14779_14784delGTCATC [p.Val4927_Ile4928del]) in the C-terminal region of RYR1. To determine the phenotypic consequences of these mutations and extend our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie CCD, we determined functional effects on Ca(2+) release channel activity of analogous deletions (p.Arg4215_Phe4217del and p.Val4926_Ile4927del) engineered into rabbit RYR1 following expression in RYR1-null (dyspedic) myotubes and HEK293 cells. In addition, we assessed effects of the p.Arg4214 Phe4216del mutation on RYR1 function in lymphoblastoid cells obtained from CCD patients heterozygous for the mutation. Here we report that both deletions significantly reduce Ca(2+) release following RYR1 activation, but by different mechanisms. While the p.Arg4214_Phe4216del deletion promotes Ca(2+) depletion from intracellular stores by exhibiting a classic  leaky channel  behavior, the p.Val4927_Ile4928del deletion reduces Ca(2+) release by disrupting Ca(2+) gating and eliminating Ca(2+) permeation through the open channel.",M1
16917943,"Mutations in RYR1 in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease.The RYR1 gene encodes the skeletal muscle isoform ryanodine receptor and is fundamental to the process of excitation-contraction coupling and skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis. Mapping to chromosome 19q13.2, the gene comprises 106 exons and encodes a protein of 5,038 amino acids. Mutations in the gene have been found in association with several diseases: the pharmacogenetic disorder, malignant hyperthermia (MH); and three congenital myopathies, including central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), multiminicore disease (MmD), and in an isolated case of a congenital myopathy characterized on histology by cores and rods. The majority of gene mutations reported are missense changes identified in cases of MH and CCD. In vitro analysis has confirmed that alteration of normal calcium homeostasis is a functional consequence of some of these changes. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies performed using data from MH and CCD patients have also suggested that mutations may be associated with a range of disease severity phenotypes. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of RYR1 mutations reported in association with MH and CCD and the present viewpoint on the use of mutation data to aid clinical diagnosis of these conditions.",M1
16866299,"Adult central core disease. Clinical, histologic and genetic aspects: case report and review of the literature.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is mainly a disease of infancy and childhood and represents a member of a group of muscular disorders known as  congenital, benign (non-progressive) myopathies . It is an uncommon disease of infancy and early childhood, and presentation is rare in adulthood. The disease is mainly familial with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, yet sporadic cases can occur. The diagnosis is based on a muscle biopsy, which documents unique morphological abnormalities of focal loss of oxidative enzyme in type I muscular fibers. The basis for this loss of such activities is represented by a near-total absence of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum in the cores. We describe a 58-year-old man diagnosed with CCD, who is one of the oldest individuals reported with CCD diagnosed by a muscle biopsy. The clinical, pathological and genetic features of this rare entity are discussed herein.",M1
16621918,"Central core disease is due to RYR1 mutations in more than 90% of patients.Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene mutations are associated with central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), multiminicore disease (MmD) and malignant hyperthermia (MH), and have been reported to be responsible for 47-67% of patients with CCD and rare cases with MmD. However, to date, the true frequency and distribution of the mutations along the RYR1 gene have not been determined yet, since mutation screening has been limited to three 'hot spots', with particular attention to the C-terminal region. In this study, 27 unrelated Japanese CCD patients were included. Clinical histories and muscle biopsies were carefully reviewed. We sequenced all the 106 exons encoding RYR1 with their flanking exon-intron boundaries, and identified 20 novel and 3 previously reported heterozygous missense mutations in 25 of the 27 CCD patients (93%), which is a much higher mutation detection rate than that perceived previously. Among them, six were located outside the known 'hot spots'. Sixteen of 27 (59%) CCD patients had mutations in the C-terminal 'hot spot'. Three CCD patients had a probable autosomal recessive disease with two heterozygous mutations. Patients with C-terminal mutations had earlier onset and rather consistent muscle pathology characterized by the presence of distinct cores in almost all type 1 fibres, interstitial fibrosis and type 2 fibre deficiency. In contrast, patients with mutations outside the C-terminal region had milder clinical phenotype and harbour more atypical cores in their muscle fibres. We also sequenced two genes encoding RYR1-associated proteins as candidate causative genes for CCD: the 12 kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the alpha1 subunit of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel or dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S). However, no mutation was found, suggesting that these genes may not, or only rarely, be responsible for CCD. Our results indicate that CCD may be caused by RYR1 mutations in the majority of patients.",M1
16550918,"Clinical and histopathological aspects of central core disease associated and non-associated with RYR1 locus.We analysed the clinical, histochemical, ultrastructural and genetic data of patients affected by central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) studied during the last 20 years. From a total series of 86 CCD-families, we have identified 46 CCD families with RYR1 mutations (16 autosomal dominant, 8 autosomal recessive, 17 sporadic cases and 5 de novo mutations). Out of the other 40 CCD families, the RyR1 gene was entirely excluded in 7 families, by cDNA sequencing or linkage analysis, indicating a genetic heterogeneity of CCD.",M1
15926054,"Progressive scoliosis in central core disease.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is a rare congenital myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance. Here, we report on two cases of progressive scoliosis in CCD, pointing out the value of a muscle biopsy to establish the correct diagnosis. The first case involves a 13-year-old boy with severe progressive scoliosis and joint contractures. The patient was initially diagnosed with arthropgryposis multiplex congenita. The second case involves a 45-year-old man with severe scoliosis that had slowly progressed over the years. Both patients suffered from unexplained muscle weakness and severe restriction of pulmonary function. The correct diagnoses were established through muscle biopsies taken from the paravertebral musculature during scoliosis surgery. Correction of the spinal deformities was achieved through posterior instrumentation in both patients, with prior anterior release in one patient. Although scoliosis is a common feature in CCD, the correct diagnosis can be missed in scoliosis patients. Therefore, we recommend a muscle biopsy in patients with scoliosis, unexplained muscle weakness and multiple joint problems.",M1
15589992,"Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease: established concepts, new cellular mechanisms involved.Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) are inherited human disorders of skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis. Both MH and CCD are linked to mutations and/or deletions in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the intracellular Ca2+ release channel, which is essential to excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. Our knowledge on how mutations in RyR1 disrupt intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and EC coupling, eventually leading to MH and CCD has been recently improved, thanks to multidisciplinary studies ranging from clinical, single channel recordings, patch-clamp experiments, and molecular biology. This review presents a brief historical perspective, on how pioneer studies resulted in associating MH and CCD to RyR1. The review is also focused on discussing novel results in regard to pathophysiological consequences of specific MH/CCD RyR1 mutant proteins, which are representative of the different cellular mechanisms that are linked to either phenotype.",M1
15347586,"Distinct effects on Ca2+ handling caused by malignant hyperthermia and central core disease mutations in RyR1.Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) are disorders of skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis that are linked to mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Certain RyR1 mutations result in an MH-selective phenotype (MH-only), whereas others result in a mixed phenotype (MH + CCD). We characterized effects on Ca2+ handling and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling of MH-only and MH + CCD mutations in RyR1 after expression in skeletal myotubes derived from RyR1-null (dyspedic) mice. Compared to wild-type RyR1-expressing myotubes, MH + CCD- and MH-only-expressing myotubes exhibited voltage-gated Ca2+ release (VGCR) that activated at more negative potentials and displayed a significantly higher incidence of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. However, maximal VGCR was reduced only for MH + CCD mutants (Y4795C, R2435L, and R2163H) in which spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations occurred with significantly longer duration (Y4795C and R2435L) or higher frequency (R2163H). Notably, myotubes expressing these MH + CCD mutations in RyR1 exhibited both increased [Ca2+]i and reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. We conclude that MH-only mutations modestly increase basal release-channel activity in a manner insufficient to alter net SR Ca2+ content ( compensated leak ), whereas the mixed MH + CCD phenotype arises from mutations that enhance basal activity to a level sufficient to promote SR Ca2+ depletion, elevate [Ca2+]i, and reduce maximal VGCR ( decompensated leak ).",M1
15336973,"Dynamic alterations in myoplasmic Ca2+ in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease.Ca2+ ions play a pivotal role in a wide array of cellular processes ranging from fertilization to cell death. In skeletal muscle, a mechanical interaction between plasma membrane dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs, L-type Ca2+ channels) and Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyR1s) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum orchestrates a complex, bi-directional Ca2+ signaling process that converts electrical impulses in the sarcolemma into myoplasmic Ca2+ transients during excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the genes that encode the two proteins that coordinate this electrochemical conversion process (the DHPR and RyR1) result in a variety of skeletal muscle disorders including malignant hyperthermia (MH), central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), multiminicore disease, nemaline rod myopathy, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Although RyR1 and DHPR disease mutations are thought to alter excitability and Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle, only recently has research begun to probe the molecular mechanisms by which these genetic defects lead to distinct clinical and histopathological manifestations. This review focuses on recent advances in determining the impact of MH and CCD mutations in RyR1 on muscle Ca2+ signaling and how these effects contribute to disease-specific aspects of these disorders.",M1
15269663,"[Genetic of diseases by abnormal functioning of the skeletal muscle-calcium releasing complex]Myoplasmic calcium homeostasis is an essential feature of skeletal muscle contraction. The calcium mobilisation complex (CMC) located at the level of the triadic junction plays a major role for the regulation of calcium fluxes between extra-cellular, cytoplasmic and intra-cellular compartments. The ryanodine receptor type I (RYR1), which is located at the level of the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a key component of the CMC. RYR1 allow the release into the myoplasm of the intralumenal stores of calcium. RYR1 interacts with other proteins: DiHydroPyridine Receptor, triadin, calsequestrin, FKBP12, calmodulin. Malignant hyperthermia (MHS) and congenital core myopathies have been associated with a dysfunction of the CMC. MHS is an autosomic dominant pharmacogenetic disease. The MH crisis is induced by exposure of the predisposed patients to halogenated volatile anaesthetics. MHS is characterised by a genetic heterogeneity and two genes, RYR1 and CACNA1S, have been associated so far with the disease. Mutations in the RYR1 gene have been recently associated with heat stroke, a related syndrome. Central Core Disease (<e>CCD</e>) and Multi minicore Disease (MmD) are congenital myopathies presenting with clinical variability and characterized by the presence of specific although heterogeneous muscle histological features: the cores. Clinical boundaries between the two diseases may overlap and the specific diagnosis is often based on the nature of the cores. These diseases show genetic heterogeneity with both autosomic dominant and recessive mode of inheritance and mutations in the SEPN1, RYR1, ACTA1, TPM3 genes have been reported. Mutations associated with MHS were mainly identified into 2 regions of the N-terminal part of RYR1. Functional role of these two domains is still unclear. Mutations responsible for congenital myopathies mainly mapped to the C terminal region of RYR1 that form the transmembrane calcium channel. Functional studies of the RYR1 mutations have shown that MHS mutations were mainly associated with an alteration of the calcium fluxes in response to caffeine or halothane while CCD mutations would result in a leaky RYR1 channel or would alter the Excitation-Contraction coupling at the level of the CMC.",M1
15175001,"Central core disease mutations R4892W, I4897T and G4898E in the ryanodine receptor isoform 1 reduce the Ca2+ sensitivity and amplitude of Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ release.Three <e>CCD</e> (central core disease) mutants, R4892W (Arg4892--&gt;), I4897T and G4898E, in the pore region of the skeletal-muscle Ca2+-release channel RyR1 (ryanodine receptor 1) were characterized using a newly developed assay that monitored Ca2+ release in the presence of Ca2+ uptake in microsomes isolated from HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells), co-expressing each of the three mutants together with SERCA1a (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1a). Both Ca2+ sensitivity and peak amplitude of Ca2+ release were either absent from or sharply decreased in homotetrameric mutants. Co-expression of wild-type RyR1 with mutant RyR1 (heterotetrameric mutants) restored Ca2+ sensitivity partially, in the ratio 1:2, or fully, in the ratio 1:1. Peak amplitude was restored only partially in the ratio 1:2 or 1:1. Reduced amplitude was not correlated with maximum Ca2+ loading or the amount of expressed RyR1 protein. High-affinity [3H]ryanodine binding and caffeine-induced Ca2+ release were also absent from the three homotetrameric mutants. These results indicate that decreased Ca2+ sensitivity is one of the serious defects in these three excitation-contraction uncoupling CCD mutations. In CCD skeletal muscles, where a mixture of wild-type and mutant RyR1 is expressed, these defects are expected to decrease Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, as well as orthograde Ca2+ release, in response to transverse tubular membrane depolarization.",M1
14708096,"A new mutation in the skeletal ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) is potentially causative of malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and severe skeletal malformation.Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) have been shown to result from missense mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene of the skeletal muscle (RYR1). A 15-year-old patient who had spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD) developed an MH crisis during general anesthesia. The patient was characterized phenotypically by block vertebrae, vertebral fusion, short neck and thorax, fused ribs, craniofacial abnormalities, spina bifida occulta, and a diaphragmatic defect closed surgically in early infancy. The diagnosis MH susceptible (MHS) was confirmed by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) on a muscle biopsy. Surprisingly, the histopathological investigation revealed the presence of CCD too. Molecular genetic investigation of the RYR1 gene was performed to search for known MH-related mutations. Cluster regions of the RYR1 gene, in which mutations have already been found, were examined by direct automated sequencing. In addition to the diagnosis MHS and CCD we were able to identify a novel RYR1 mutation in exon 46: 7358ATC &gt; ACC, resulting in an Ile2453Thr substitution. This mutation was also present in the mother, in whom MH disposition and CCD were determined by muscle investigations. We suggest that the newly identified RYR1 mutation is closely associated with MH and CCD. A probable causative role of the RYR1 gene in SCD patients should be assessed by further genetic investigations.",M1

Eleven individuals with RYR1 mutations are described. Four index cases showed features consistent with a congenital myopathy (hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and skeletal abnormalities including congenital hip dislocation and scoliosis). All four cases and subsequently seven other family members were found to possess novel mutations in the RYR1 gene. The degree of disability varied from one clinically normal individual, to another who had never achieved independent ambulation (the only patient with a de novo mutation). Four cases showed a mild reduction in vital capacity, repeated nocturnal polysomnography showed hypoxaemia in one case. A variety of muscle biopsy features were found; central cores were absent in the youngest case, and the biopsy specimens from two others were more suggestive of mini-core myopathy. In all cases missense mutations in exons 101, 102, and 103 of the RYR1 gene on were found. Future laboratory diagnosis of suspected cases and family members will be less invasive and more accurate with DNA analysis. Clinicians, especially paediatricians and orthopaedic surgeons, should be aware of this disorder because of the potential risk of MH.",M1

Two fetuses died before birth (at 31 and 32 weeks) and five infants presented severe symptoms at birth (multiple arthrogryposis, congenital dislocation of the hips, severe hypotonia and hypotrophy, skeletal and feet deformities, kyphoscoliosis, etc.). Histochemical and ultrastructural studies of muscle biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of CCD showing unique large eccentric cores. Molecular genetic investigations led to the identification of mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene in three families, two with autosomal recessive (AR) and one with autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. RYR1 gene mutations were located in the C-terminal domain in two families (AR and AD) and in the N-terminal domain of the third one (AR). This is the first report of mutations in the RYR1 gene involved in a severe form of CCD presenting as a fetal akinesia syndrome with AD and AR inheritances.",M1
12810058,"The Ile2453Thr mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene 1 is associated with facilitated calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum by 4-chloro-m-cresol in human myotubes.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is a congenital disorder of skeletal muscle that is characterised histologically by typical central cores in type 1 skeletal muscle fibres. This disease is associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and has been linked to the gene of skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor RYR1. In this study, we present a family with the spontaneous occurrence of the RYR1 Ile2453Thr mutation. Affected individuals were diagnosed as susceptible to malignant hyperthermia in the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) and showed histological signs of CCD. Myotubes were derived from the index patient. The calcium homeostasis in response to the ryanodine receptor agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol (4CmC) was investigated by calcium imaging using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe FURA 2. In the myotubes derived from the mutation carrier, the EC(50) of 4CmC was reduced to 94 micro as compared to 201 microM in a control group of 16 individuals non-susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. In the myotubes of the non-affected family members, the EC(50) was found within the same range as that of the control group. The reduction of EC(50) indicates a facilitated calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in the myotubes of the index patient suggesting that the RYR1 Ile2453Thr mutation is pathogenic for the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and CCD of the two affected individuals.",M1
12642598,"The pore region of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor is a primary locus for excitation-contraction uncoupling in central core disease.Human central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is caused by mutations/deletions in the gene that encodes the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Previous studies have shown that CCD mutations in the NH2-terminal region of RyR1 lead to the formation of leaky SR Ca2+ release channels when expressed in myotubes derived from RyR1-knockout (dyspedic) mice, whereas a COOH-terminal mutant (I4897T) results in channels that are not leaky to Ca2+ but lack depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (termed excitation-contraction [EC] uncoupling). We show here that store depletion resulting from NH2-terminal (Y523S) and COOH-terminal (Y4795C) leaky CCD mutant release channels is eliminated after incorporation of the I4897T mutation into the channel (Y523S/I4897T and Y4795C/I4897T). In spite of normal SR Ca2+ content, myotubes expressing the double mutants lacked voltage-gated Ca2+ release and thus exhibited an EC uncoupling phenotype similar to that of I4897T-expressing myotubes. We also show that dyspedic myotubes expressing each of seven recently identified CCD mutations located in exon 102 of the RyR1 gene (G4890R, R4892W, I4897T, G4898E, G4898R, A4905V, R4913G) behave as EC-uncoupled release channels. Interestingly, voltage-gated Ca2+ release was nearly abolished (reduced approximately 90%) while caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was only marginally reduced in R4892W-expressing myotubes, indicating that this mutation preferentially disrupts voltage-sensor activation of release. These data demonstrate that CCD mutations in exon 102 disrupt release channel permeation to Ca2+ during EC coupling and that this region represents a primary molecular locus for EC uncoupling in CCD.",M1
12566385,"Clinical and functional effects of a deletion in a COOH-terminal lumenal loop of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.We have identified a patient affected by a relatively severe form of central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), carrying a heterozygous deletion (amino acids 4863-4869) in the pore-forming region of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel. The functional effect of this deletion was investigated (i) in lymphoblastoid cells from the affected patient and her mother, who was also found to harbour the mutation and (ii) in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant mutant channels. Lymphoblastoid cells carrying the RYR1 deletion exhibit an 'unprompted' calcium release from intracellular stores, resulting in significantly smaller thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca(2+) stores, compared with lymphoblastoid cells from control individuals. Blocking the RYR1 with dantrolene restored the intracellular calcium stores to levels similar to those found in control cells. Single channel and [(3)H]ryanodine binding measurements of heterologously expressed mutant channels revealed a reduced ion conductance and loss of ryanodine binding and regulation by Ca(2+). Heterologous expression of recombinant RYR1 peptides and analysis of their membrane topology demonstrate that the deleted amino acids are localized in the lumenal loop connecting membrane-spanning segments M8 and M10. We provide evidence that a deletion in the lumenal loop of RYR1 alters channel function and causes CCD.",M1

We report here on the molecular analysis of the RYR1 gene in Italian families referred as potential cases of MH or in patients with CCD or multicore/minicore myopathy. Of a total of 20 individuals with mutations in the RYR1 gene, 14 were part of a group of 47 MH susceptible (MHS) patients, 4 of 34 individuals diagnosed as MH equivocal (MHE), and 2 were patients diagnosed with minicore myopathy and CCD, respectively. Mutations were found to segregate with the MHS or MHE phenotype within the families of the probands. A discordance between phenotype and genotype was observed in a family where a mutation detected in an MHS proband was also found in the father who had been diagnosed MH normal (MHN) at the IVCT. In addition to known mutations, seven novel mutations were found, five of which occurred in exons encoding the C-terminal region of RYR1. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of RYR1 represents an additional hot spot for mutations in patients with MH, similar to what has been reported for patients with CCD.",M1
12161072,"Altered ryanodine receptor function in central core disease: leaky or uncoupled Ca(2+) release channels?Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal-dominant human congenital myopathy that is associated with at least 22 different mutations in the skeletal muscle isoform of ryanodine receptor (RyR1). CCD mutations in RyR1 have been proposed to lead to the formation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channels that are excessively leaky to Ca(2+). Although some of the CCD mutations in RyR1 may indeed result in leaky SR Ca(2+) release channels, the leaky-channel hypothesis may not represent the only mechanism for muscle weakness in this disorder. The presence of an alternate mechanism of muscle weakness in CCD is supported by the observation that muscle cells expressing a CCD mutation in the putative pore-forming segment of RyR1 (I4898T) exhibit a functional uncoupling of SR Ca(2+) release from sarcolemmal depolarization. These observations cannot be explained by the leaky-channel hypothesis and indicate that muscle weakness in some forms of CCD arises from an alternate and completely unexpected mechanism, termed  excitation-contraction uncoupling.

12124989,"RYR1 mutations causing central core disease are associated with more severe malignant hyperthermia in vitro contracture test phenotypes.Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) are autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal muscle. Susceptibility to MH is only apparent after exposure to volatile anesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants. CCD patients present with diffuse muscular weakness but are also at risk of MH. Mutations in RYR1 (19q13.1), encoding a skeletal muscle calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor), account for the majority of MH and CCD cases. Fifteen RYR1 N-terminal mutations are considered causative of MH susceptibility, five of which are also associated with CCD. In the first extensive UK population survey, eight of 15 mutations were detected in 85 out of 297 (29%) unrelated MH susceptible cases, with G2434R detected in 53 cases (18%). Mutation type was shown to affect significantly MH phenotypes (in vitro contracture test (IVCT) response to caffeine, halothane, and ryanodine). RYR1 mutations associated with both CCD and MH (R163C, R2163H, R2435H) had more severe caffeine and halothane response phenotypes than those associated with MH alone. Mutations near the amino terminal (R163C, G341R) had a relatively greater effect on responses to caffeine than halothane, with a significantly increased caffeine:halothane tension ratio compared to G2434R of the central domain. All phenotypes were more severe in males than females, and were also affected by muscle specimen size and viability. Discordance between RYR1 genotype and IVCT phenotype was observed in seven families (nine individuals), with five false-positives and four false-negatives. This represents the most extensive study of MH patient clinical and genetic data to date and demonstrates that RYR1 mutations involved in CCD are those associated with one end of the spectrum of MH IVCT phenotypes.",M1
11741831,"Identification of four novel mutations in the C-terminal membrane spanning domain of the ryanodine receptor 1: association with central core disease and alteration of calcium homeostasis.The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1; OMIM 180901) on chromosome 19q13.1 encodes the skeletal muscle calcium release channel. To date, more than 25 missense mutations have been identified in RYR1 and are associated with central core disease (<e>CCD</e>; OMIM 117000) and/or the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility phenotype (MHS1; OMIM 145600). The majority of RYR1 mutations are clustered in the N-terminal hydrophilic domain of the protein. Only four mutations have been identified so far in the highly conserved C-terminal region encoding the luminal/transmembrane domain of the protein which forms the ion pore. Three of these mutations have been found to segregate with pure or mixed forms of CCD. We have screened the C-terminal domain of the RYR1 gene for mutations in 50 European patients, diagnosed clinically and/or histologically as having CCD. We have identified five missense mutations (four of them novel) in 13 index patients. The mutations cluster in exons 101 and 102 and replace amino acids which are conserved in all known vertebrate RYR genes. In order to study the functional effect of these mutations, we have immortalized B-lymphocytes from some of the patients and studied their [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis. We show that lymphoblasts carrying the newly identified RYR1 mutations exhibit: (i) a release of calcium from intracellular stores in the absence of any pharmacological activators of RYR; (ii) significantly smaller thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular calcium stores, compared to lymphoblasts from control individuals; and (iii) a normal sensitivity of the calcium release to the RYR inhibitor dantrolene. Our data suggest the C-terminal domain of RYR1 as a hot spot for mutations leading to the CCD phenotype. If the functional alterations of mutated RYR channels observed in lymphoblastoid cells are also present in skeletal muscles this could explain the predominant symptom of CCD, i.e. chronic muscle weakness. Finally, the study of calcium homeostasis in lymphoblastoid cells naturally expressing RYR1 mutations offers a novel non-invasive approach to gain insights into the pathogenesis of MH and CCD.",M1
11709545,"Familial and sporadic forms of central core disease are associated with mutations in the C-terminal domain of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant congenital myopathy. Diagnosis is based on the presence of cores in skeletal muscles. CCD has been linked to the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and is considered to be an allelic disease of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. However, the report of a recessive form of transmission together with a variable clinical presentation has raised the question of the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Analyzing a panel of 34 families exclusively recruited on the basis of both clinically and morphologically expressed CCD, 12 different mutations of the C-terminal domain of RYR1 have been identified in 16 unrelated families. Morphological analysis of the patients' muscles showed different aspects of cores, all of them associated with mutations in the C-terminal region of RYR1. Furthermore, we characterized the presence of neomutations in the RyR1 gene in four families. This indicates that neomutations into the RyR1 gene are not a rare event and must be taken into account for genetic studies of families that present with congenital myopathies type 'central core disease'. Three mutations led to the deletion in frame of amino acids. This is the first report of amino acid deletions in RYR1 associated with CCD. According to a four-transmembrane domain model, the mutations concentrated mostly in the myoplasmic and luminal loops linking, respectively, transmembrane domains T1 and T2 or T3 and T4 of RYR1.",M1
11524458,"Functional effects of central core disease mutations in the cytoplasmic region of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is a human myopathy that involves a dysregulation in muscle Ca(2)+ homeostasis caused by mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the protein that comprises the calcium release channel of the SR. Although genetic studies have clearly demonstrated linkage between mutations in RyR1 and CCD, the impact of these mutations on release channel function and excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle is unknown. Toward this goal, we have engineered the different CCD mutations found in the NH(2)-terminal region of RyR1 into a rabbit RyR1 cDNA (R164C, I404M, Y523S, R2163H, and R2435H) and characterized the functional effects of these mutations after expression in myotubes derived from RyR1-knockout (dyspedic) mice. Resting Ca(2)+ levels were elevated in dyspedic myotubes expressing four of these mutants (Y523S &gt; R2163H &gt; R2435H R164C &gt; I404M RyR1). A similar rank order was also found for the degree of SR Ca(2)+ depletion assessed using maximal concentrations of caffeine (10 mM) or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 30 microM). Although all of the CCD mutants fully restored L-current density, voltage-gated SR Ca(2)+ release was smaller and activated at more negative potentials for myotubes expressing the NH(2)-terminal CCD mutations. The shift in the voltage dependence of SR Ca(2)+ release correlated strongly with changes in resting Ca(2)+, SR Ca(2)+ store depletion, and peak voltage-gated release, indicating that increased release channel activity at negative membrane potentials promotes SR Ca(2)+ leak. Coexpression of wild-type and Y523S RyR1 proteins in dyspedic myotubes resulted in release channels that exhibited an intermediate degree of SR Ca(2)+ leak. These results demonstrate that the NH(2)-terminal CCD mutants enhance release channel sensitivity to activation by voltage in a manner that leads to increased SR Ca(2)+ leak, store depletion, and a reduction in voltage-gated Ca(2)+ release. Two fundamentally distinct cellular mechanisms (leaky channels and EC uncoupling) are proposed to explain how altered release channel function caused by different mutations in RyR1 could result in muscle weakness in CCD.",M1
11274444,"Excitation--contraction uncoupling by a human central core disease mutation in the ryanodine receptor.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is a human congenital myopathy characterized by fetal hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness that is linked to mutations in the gene encoding the type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). CCD is thought to arise from Ca(2+)-induced damage stemming from mutant RyR1 proteins forming  leaky  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channels. A novel mutation in the C-terminal region of RyR1 (I4898T) accounts for an unusually severe and highly penetrant form of CCD in humans [Lynch, P. J., Tong, J., Lehane, M., Mallet, A., Giblin, L., Heffron, J. J., Vaughan, P., Zafra, G., MacLennan, D. H. &amp; McCarthy, T. V. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 4164--4169]. We expressed in skeletal myotubes derived from RyR1-knockout (dyspedic) mice the analogous mutation engineered into a rabbit RyR1 cDNA (I4897T). Here we show that homozygous expression of I4897T in dyspedic myotubes results in a complete uncoupling of sarcolemmal excitation from voltage-gated SR Ca(2+) release without significantly altering resting cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, SR Ca(2+) content, or RyR1-mediated enhancement of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) channel activity. Coexpression of both I4897T and wild-type RyR1 resulted in a 60% reduction in voltage-gated SR Ca(2+) release, again without altering resting cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, SR Ca(2+) content, or DHPR channel activity. These findings indicate that muscle weakness suffered by individuals possessing the I4898T mutation involves a functional uncoupling of sarcolemmal excitation from SR Ca(2+) release, rather than the expression of overactive or leaky SR Ca(2+) release channels.",M1

The gene RYR1, encoding the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, is responsible for about 50% of the cases of MH and some cases of CCD. However, genetic heterogeneity occurs in MH and a mutation in a second gene (CACLN1A3), encoding the alpha1-subunit of the dihydropyridine (DHP) channel, has recently been found in a large MH French family. The presence of this mutation in patients with CCD has not yet been reported. In this study, we analyzed the A3333G mutation in 5 unrelated patients affected by CCD and 31 MH-susceptible relatives (from 19 MH families) and did not find this mutation in any of them. Nevertheless, the report of data on newly described mutations in different populations is important to estimate the contributions of each gene mutation to the phenotype of MH and CCD.",M1
11063719,"An autosomal dominant congenital myopathy with cores and rods is associated with a neomutation in the RYR1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor.Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) and nemaline myopathy (NM) are congenital myopathies for which differential diagnosis is often based on the presence either of cores or rods. Missense mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) have been identified in some families with CCD. Mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin and alpha-actin genes have been associated with most dominant forms of NM. Analysis of the RYR1 cDNA in a French family identified a novel Y4796C mutation that lies in the C-terminal channel-forming domain of the RyR1 protein. This mutation was linked not only to a severe and penetrant form of CCD, but also to the presence of rods in the muscle fibres and to the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) phenotype. The Y4796C mutation was introduced into a rabbit RYR1 cDNA and expressed in HEK-293 cells. Expression of the mutant RYR1 cDNA produced channels with increased caffeine sensitivity and a significantly reduced maximal level of Ca(2+) release. Single-cell Ca(2+) analysis showed that the resting cytoplasmic level was increased by 60% in cells expressing the mutant channel. These data support the view that the rate of Ca(2+) leakage is increased in the mutant channel. The resulting chronic elevation in myoplasmic concentration is likely to be responsible for the severe expression of the disease. Haplotyping analysis indicated that the mutation arose as a neomutation in the proband. This first report of a neomutation in the RYR1 gene has strong implications for genetic linkage studies of MHS or CCD, two diseases characterized by a genetic heterogeneity.",M1
10951187,"Ca2+ signalling and muscle disease.Transient elevations of intracellular Ca2+ play a signalling role in such complex cellular functions as contraction, secretion, fertilization, proliferation, metabolism, heartbeat and memory. However, prolonged elevation of Ca2+ above about 10 microM is deleterious to a cell and can activate apoptosis. In muscle, there is a narrow window of Ca2+ dysregulation in which abnormalities in Ca2+ regulatory proteins can lead to disease, rather than apoptosis. Key proteins in the regulation of muscle Ca2+ are the voltage-dependent, dihydropyridine-sensitive, L-type Ca2+ channels located in the transverse tubule and Ca2+ release channels in the junctional terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Abnormalities in these proteins play a key role in malignant hyperthermia (MH), a toxic response to anesthetics, and in central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), a muscle myopathy. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCAs) return sarcoplasmic Ca2+ to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Loss of SERCA1a Ca2+ pump function is one cause of exercise-induced impairment of the relaxation of skeletal muscle, in Brody disease. Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. Studies with knockout and transgenic mice show that gain of inhibitory function of phospholamban alters cardiac contractility and could be a causal feature in some cardiomyopathies. Calsequestrin, calreticulin, and a series of other acidic, lumenal, Ca2+ binding proteins provide a buffer for Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of cardiac calsequestrin leads to cardiomyopathy and ablation of calreticulin alters cardiac development.",M1
10790202,"Ryanodine receptor mutations in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease.Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that manifests in response to anesthetic triggering agents. Central core disease (<e>CCD</e>) is a myopathy closely associated with MH. Both MH and CCD are primarily disorders of calcium regulation in skeletal muscle. The ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene encodes the key channel which mediates calcium release in skeletal muscle during excitation-contraction coupling, and mutations in this gene are considered to account for susceptibility to MH (MHS) in more than 50% of cases and in the majority of CCD cases. To date, 22 missense mutations in the 15,117 bp coding region of the RYR1 cDNA have been found to segregate with the MHS trait, while a much smaller number of these mutations is associated with CCD. The majority of RYR1 mutations appear to be clustered in the N-terminal amino acid residues 35-614 (MH/CCD region 1) and the centrally located residues 2163-2458 (MH/CCD region 2). The only mutation identified outside of these regions to date is a single mutation associated with a severe form of CCD in the highly conserved C-terminus of the gene. All of the RYR1 mutations result in amino acid substitutions in the myoplasmic portion of the protein, with the exception of the mutation in the C-terminus, which resides in the lumenal/transmembrane region. Functional analysis shows that MHS and CCD mutations produce RYR1 abnormalities that alter the channel kinetics for calcium inactivation and make the channel hyper- and hyposensitive to activating and inactivating ligands, respectively. The likely deciding factors in determining whether a particular RYR1 mutation results in MHS alone or MHS and CCD are: sensitivity of the RYR1 mutant proteins to agonists; the level of abnormal channel-gating caused by the mutation; the consequential decrease in the size of the releasable calcium store and increase in resting concentration of calcium; and the level of compensation achieved by the muscle with respect to maintaining calcium homeostasis. From a diagnostic point of view, the ultimate goal of development of a simple non-invasive test for routine diagnosis of MHS remains elusive. Attainment of this goal will require further detailed molecular genetic investigations aimed at solving heterogeneity and discordance issues in MHS; new initiatives aimed at identifying modulating factors that influence the penetrance of clinical MH in MHS individuals; and detailed studies aimed at describing the full epidemiological picture of in vitro responses of muscle to agents used in diagnosis of MH susceptibility.",M1

It is very uncommon to diagnose cases affected by CCD in youth and adulthood. The disease is mainly familial with a dominant autosomal pattern of inheritance, but sporadic cases are known to occur. The candidate gene has been localized on chromosome 19q13.1, and is allelic with RYR-1 ( ryanodine receptor  [calcium release channel gene]), the gene responsible of the susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. In some familial cases of CCD a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia was also recognized. The diagnosis is only made based on muscular biopsy, which documents some peculiar morphological abnormalities, i.e. focal losses of oxidative enzyme activities, exclusively in type I muscular fibres. The basis for the loss of such activities is represented by an almost total absence of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum in those focal regions of muscle fibres. Cores may be  structured  and  unstructured  based on the reactivity with myosin ATPases, which ultrastructurally means preservation or destruction of myofilaments. Both structured and unstructured cores qualify this disease in the same way. The authors have observed two cases of CCD in patients in their non infantile age. Both diagnoses were accomplished by means of muscular biopsy, and the results of their studies in both cases are herein presented and discussed.",M1

It is occasionally associated with a myopathy, central core disease (<e>CCD</e>), named after its predominant histochemical characteristic. The penetration of CCD is variable, but typically affected individuals show delayed motor milestones in infancy and remain physically compromised. It was thought until recently that individuals with CCD were always susceptible to MH. Individuals from eight CCD families were screened for the presence of 13 mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene, reported previously to be associated with MH and/or CCD: none was detected. In seven of these families, where CCD and MH co-existed, we examined the segregation of CCD, MH susceptibility and chromosome 19q markers. In four families, there was complete co-segregation between MH, CCD and the chromosome 19 markers, but in one large pedigree there was a clear lack of segregation of CCD with either MH or chromosome 19 markers and there was no segregation between MH and these markers. This is unequivocal evidence that CCD, in common with MH, is genetically heterogeneous. In the two other families, CCD segregated with chromosome 19 markers but not all individuals with CCD were susceptible to MH. We recommend determination of MH susceptibility in all patients with CCD, irrespective of the MH status of their relatives with CCD.",M1

In one CCD family, the disease was caused by a recently reported MH mutation, Arg-2454-His. Two novel mutations, Thr-2206-Arg and Arg-2454-Cys were detected, each in a single pedigree. In the 109 individuals of the 25 families with RYR1 mutations cosegregation between genetic result and IVCT was almost perfect, only three genotypes were discordant with the IVCT phenotypes, suggesting a true sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of minimally 81.8% for this test. Screening of the transmembraneous region of RYR1 did not yield a new mutation confirming the cytosolic portion of the protein to be of main functional importance for disease pathogenesis.",M1

It is characterised by defective ossification, delayed bone and tooth development, stomatognathic and craniofacial abnormalities and it is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene that is responsible for osteoblast differentiation. CCD is a dental disease that needs complex rehabilitation and the assistance of several specialists. In most cases, this disease precipitates towards the end of childhood with the progressive morbidity of the deciduous dentition, thus leading to edentulism at a young age and giving patients an older appearance. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed within literature. The aim of this paper is to revise the literature on the proposed therapeutic approaches for the functional and aesthetical rehabilitation of the typical defects caused by CCD in the cephalic region, and to identify the most effective therapy currently available. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective therapeutic approach for the early treatment of the orthodontic and orthopaedic diseases in CCD patients would start with an orthopaedic treatment of the upper jaw followed by orthodontic and surgical treatments. When growth is completed a reintervention for maxillofacial surgery and the orthodontic treatment may be required. Finally, if some teeth are missing. function and aesthetics can be achieved replacing them with prosthesis.",M2

We have previously identified a series of RUNX2 mutations in Korean CCD patients, including a novel R131G missense mutation in the Runt-homology domain. Here, we examine the functional consequences of the RUNX2(R131G) mutation, which could potentially affect DNA binding, nuclear localization signal, and/or heterodimerization with core-binding factor-beta (CBF-beta). Immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis with subcellular fractions show that RUNX2(R131G) is localized in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that heterodimerization with CBF-beta is retained. However, precipitation assays with biotinylated oligonucleotides and reporter gene assays with RUNX2 responsive promoters together reveal that DNA-binding activity and consequently the transactivation of potential of RUNX2(R131G) is abrogated. We conclude that loss of DNA binding, but not nuclear localization or CBF-beta heterodimerization, causes RUNX2 haploinsufficiency in patients with the RUNX2(R131G) mutation. Retention of specific functions including nuclear localization and binding to CBF-beta of the RUNX2(R131G) mutation may render the mutant protein an effective competitor that interferes with wild-type function.",M2

We studied a Chinese family that included three affected individuals with CCD phenotypes; the clinical features of patients with CCD include delayed closure of fontanelles, frontal bossing, dysplasia of clavicles, late tooth eruption, and other skeletal anomalies. X-ray analysis showed aplasia of the clavicles. The RUNX2 gene was studied by PCR and direct sequencing of the entire coding region and the exon-intron boundaries of the gene. A novel missense mutation (c.1259C--&gt;T[p.T420I]) in RUNX2 gene exon 7 was identified; it was found in the affected individuals in this Chinese family, but was not present in an unaffected family member or in 100 unrelated normal controls. This is the first report that gives evidence that the T420I mutation of RUNX2 is associated with CCD, expanding the spectrum of RUNX2 mutations causing CCD.",M2
20014132,"Severe cleidocranial dysplasia and hypophosphatasia in a child with microdeletion of the C-terminal region of RUNX2.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia due to mutations causing haploinsufficiency of RUNX2, an osteoblast transcription factor specific for bone and cartilage. The classic form of CCD is characterized by delayed closure of the fontanels, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies. Clinical reports suggest that a subset of patients with CCD have skeletal changes which mimic hypophosphatasia (HPP). Mutations in RUNX2 are detected in approximately 65% of cases of CCD, and microdeletions occur in 13%. We present clinical and radiological features in a 6-year-old child with severe CCD manifested by absence of the clavicles marked calvarial hypomineralization, osteoporosis and progressive kyphoscoliosis. HPP features included Bowdler spurs, severe osteopenia, and low alkaline phosphatase. Following negative mutation analysis of RUNX2, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray was performed. The result revealed a microdeletion in RUNX2, disrupting the C-terminal part of the gene.",M2
19960292,"The role of periodontal ligament cells in delayed tooth eruption in patients with cleidocranial dysostosis.OBJECTIVE: The clinical appearance of patients with cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>), which is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, is characterized by anomalies of the clavicles, thorax, spine, pelvis and extremities and by disturbances of the skull and tooth development. Of orthodontic relevance are multiple supernumerary teeth associated with delayed tooth eruption. The present investigation is based on the hypothesis that an altered phenotypic expression of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells from CCD patients and a reduced ability of those cells to support the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts might contribute to delayed tooth eruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, PDL cells from healthy donors and from two patients with clinically and molecular biologically diagnosed CCD were characterized for the basal and induced mRNA expression of osteoblast marker genes. The physiological relevance of the findings for the differentiation of osteoclasts was examined in an osteoclast assay, as well as in a co-culture model of PDL cells and osteoclast precursors. RESULTS: Both CCD patients displayed missense mutations of the RUNX2 gene. The in vitro experiments revealed an unaltered expression of RUNX2 mRNA, however especially in CCD patient 2 there was a reduced basal expression of mRNA for the key regulatory gene for bone remodeling RANKL. Furthermore, compared to the control cells from healthy donors, these factors were less inducible by stimulation of the cultures with 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In the osteoclast assays as well as in the co-culture experiments, PDL cells from the CCD patients showed a reduced capacity to induce the differentiation of active osteoclasts. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PDL cells from CCD patients express a less distinctive osteoblastic phenotype resulting in an impaired ability to support osteoclastogenesis which might, in part, account for the delayed tooth eruption that can be observed clinically.",M2

Complete clinical and radiological examination of this patient confirmed the diagnosis of cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>). Her father also presented similar features with a lesser clinical severity. CCD is an autosomal-dominant heritable skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor RUNX2 gene. Failure of tooth eruption is probably mainly due to this mutated gene in CCD patients. Interdisciplinary treatment approach is obligatory for rehabilitation of these patients.

The aetiology though not completely known is thought to be due to a CBFA1 (core binding factor activity 1) gene defect on the short arm of chromosome 6p21. CBFA1 is essential for differentiation of stem cells into osteoblasts, so any defect in this gene will cause defects in membranous and endochondral bone formation.

We performed mutation analysis of RUNX2 on four unrelated Chinese individuals with CCD. Three novel distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: two missense and one frameshift. These mutations were exclusively clustered within the Runt domain. One missense mutation converts threonine to isoleucine at codon 200 (T200I). The other one substitutes leucine for arginine at codon 225 (R225L), which affects many family members. The frame-shift mutation (214fs) in exon3 leads to the introduction of a translational stop codon at codon 221, resulting in a truncated RUNX2 protein. The reporter gene assays revealed that all the mutants exhibited significantly reduced transactivation activities on the osteocalcin promoter.

The purposes of this study were to identify genetic causes of two CCD nuclear families and to report their clinical phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified two CCD nuclear families and performed mutational analyses to clarify the underlying molecular genetic etiology. RESULTS: Mutational analysis revealed a novel nonsense mutation (c.273T&gt;A, p.L93X) in family 1 and a de novo missense one (c.673C&gt;T, p.R225W) in family 2. Individuals with a nonsense mutation showed maxillary hypoplasia, delayed eruption, multiple supernumerary teeth, and normal stature. In contrast, an individual with a de novo missense mutation in the Runt domain showed only one supernumerary tooth and short stature.

The RUNX2 has two major isoforms derived from P1 and P2 promoters. Over 90 mutations of RUNX2 have been reported associated with CCD. In our study, DNA samples of nine individuals from three unrelated CCD families were collected and screened for all exons of RUNX2 and 2 kb of P1 and P2 promoters. We identified two point mutations in the RUNX2 gene in Case 1, including a nonsense mutation (c.577C&gt;T) that has been reported previously and a silent substitution (c.240G&gt;A). In vitro studies demonstrated that c.577C&gt;T mutation led to truncated RUNX2 protein production and diminished stimulating effects on mouse osteocalcin promoter activity when compared with full-length Runx2-II and Runx2-I isoforms. These results confirm that loss of function RUNX2 mutation (c.577C&gt;T) in Case 1 family is responsible for its CCD phenotype.",M2

Molecular genetic analysis of the RUNX2 gene was non-informative. A routine 2D ultrasound examination carried out at a local hospital at gestational age 12 weeks showed no signs of CCD. A 3D ultrasound examination in week 15+4 showed a fetus with typical CCD features including large fontanelles, lack of nasal bones, clavicles without the typical S-form, as well as severe delay in calvarial ossification, especially in the midline. Serial 3D ultrasound examinations during pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis, and over time the manifestations became even more distinct. The diagnosis was clinically confirmed at birth. This case suggests that the typical craniofacial CCD traits, including wide unmineralized areas in the calvarial midline and missing nasal bones, are easily recognizable using 3D ultrasound as early as in week 15.",M2
19028669,"A Runx2 threshold for the cleidocranial dysplasia phenotype.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) in humans is an autosomal-dominant skeletal disease that results from mutations in the bone-specific transcription factor RUNX2 (CBFA1/AML3). However, distinct RUNX2 mutations in CCD do not correlate with the severity of the disease. Here we generated a new mouse model with a hypomorphic Runx2 mutant allele (Runx2(neo7)), in which only part of the transcript is processed to full-length (wild-type) Runx2 mRNA. Homozygous Runx2(neo7/neo7) mice express a reduced level of wild-type Runx2 mRNA (55-70%) and protein. This mouse model allowed us to establish the minimal requirement of functional Runx2 for normal bone development. Runx2(neo7/neo7) mice have grossly normal skeletons with no abnormalities observed in the growth plate, but do exhibit developmental defects in calvaria and clavicles that persist through post-natal growth. Clavicle defects are caused by disrupted endochondral bone formation during embryogenesis. These hypomorphic mice have altered calvarial bone volume, as observed by histology and microCT imaging, and decreased expression of osteoblast marker genes. The bone phenotype of the heterozygous mice, which have 79-84% of wild-type Runx2 mRNA, is normal. These results show there is a critical gene dosage requirement of functional Runx2 for the formation of intramembranous bone tissues during embryogenesis. A decrease to 70% of wild-type Runx2 levels results in the CCD syndrome, whereas levels &gt;79% produce a normal skeleton. Our findings suggest that the range of bone phenotypes in CCD patients is attributable to quantitative reduction in the functional activity of RUNX2.",M2

It is caused by mutations of the transcription factor RUNX2, which is known as a major regulator of bone differentiation. OBJECTIVE: To report on 3 Chinese pediatric cases of CCD with an emphasis on the clinical presentation and diagnostic modalities. CASE SUMMARY: 3 Chinese children were admitted to our hospital because of short stature. All the children had hypoplastic clavicles, absent calvarium, open fontanel, and messy palmprint. Screening laboratory test results for bone mineral density, free thyroxine, and thyroid stimulating hormone were all normal. One child had mental retardation. Two were hereditary, and 1 was sporadic.

Absence of cellular cementum at the root apex is presumed to be one of the factors for failure or delayed eruption. The aim of this study was to analyze the root cementum of supernumerary(S) and permanent teeth (P) of a CCD patient and to compare the findings with those of normal individuals with special emphasis on delayed eruption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ground sections of 12 extracted teeth (9S + 3P) of a CCD patient and 12 teeth of normal individuals (5S + 7P) were taken for the study. The sections were longitudinal and 50 microm thick. Root characteristics were recorded with the aid of a light microscope. RESULTS: The absence of apical cellular cementum, increased root resorption and increased percentage of the gap type of cemento-enamel (C-E) junctions were significant findings noted both in the supernumerary and permanent teeth of the CCD patient. CONCLUSION: The presumption of cellular cementum is essential for tooth eruption is not supported by the findings of the present study. Delayed exception could be attributed to various other factors like mechanical obstruction, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels etc. Also, the significance of the increased percentage of the gap type of C-E junctions and its role in tooth eruption has to be further evaluated.",M2
18777095,"A novel RUNX2 mutation in cleidocranial dysplasia patients.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal-dominant heritable skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the RUNX2 gene. Here, the RUNX2 gene was analyzed within a CCD family from China, and a novel missense mutation (c. 475G --&gt; C [p.G159R]) was identified. Normal and mutant RUNX2 expression vectors were then constructed and expressed transiently in NIH3T3 cells. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting showed that wild-type RUNX2 protein was localized exclusively in the nucleus; however, the mutant protein was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which demonstrated that transport of the RUNX2 mutant into the nucleus was disturbed by the G159R mutation. Therefore, we suggest that G159 is very important to promote RUNX2 nuclear localization. According to clinical analysis, the patient displays severe dysplasia of bones and relatively low-grade craniofacial abnormality, and we infer that G159 may be vital for normal skeletal development, other than control of tooth number. These findings confirm that mutations in the RUNX2 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of CCD across different ethnic backgrounds.",M2

One nonsense and 3 missense mutations were detected, including one novel mutation, a heterozygous G to C transition mutation at nucleotide 475 in exon 2, which converts glycine to arginine at codon 159 (G159R). Two mutations, R225W and R391X, were reported in Chinese patients with CCD for the first time. Our findings show that R225 mutations interfere with nuclear accumulation of RUNX2 protein, and that a lack of nuclear RUNX2 protein accumulation is at least one of the causes of haploinsufficiency in these cases. Body stature was significantly reduced in the 3 male and 1 female cases. The cases all had malformations of the tarsometatarsal joints. In 1 case, the humeroulnar joints and humeroradial joints were abnormal, and the elbow looked like a triangle.

It is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, which encodes an osteoblast-specific transcription factor and maps to chromosome 6p21. We report clinical and molecular cytogenetic studies in a patient with clinical features of CCD including wormian bones, delayed fontanel closure, hypoplastic clavicles and pubic rami, and supernumerary dentition. Additional abnormalities of bone growth and connective tissue, including easy bruisability, scarring, bleeding, joint hypermobility, and developmental delay were also observed. Molecular cytogenetic studies identified a de novo apparently balanced three-way translocation 46,XY,t(4;6;21)(p16;p21.1;q21). Further mapping revealed the breakpoint on 6p21 to be approximately 50 kb upstream of exon 1 of the RUNX2 gene, with RUNX2 being intact on the derivative chromosome 6. We hypothesize that the proband's CCD has arisen from disruption of the developmentally regulated gene RUNX2 at the 6p21 breakpoint, due to a position effect mutation which may have altered the expression of the gene. Further studies might unravel a new regulatory element for RUNX2.",M2

PURPOSE: To the best of our knowledge it was analysed for the first time, whether this is correlated with an increased rate of collagen I in oral mucosa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 27 soft tissue biopsies of six CCD-patients and 17 tissue samples of 12 healthy persons were labled with a monoclonal antibody against collagen I and the bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phophatase-kit. The histological slices were analysed by a digital image recognition software under a fully automated microscope and the rate of collagen I was converted into amounts of grey tones. RESULTS: The amount of grey tones reached from 11.909 to 15.319 in the CCD-group, and from 2752 to 12.556 in the control group. The U-Test of Mann, Whitney and Wilcoxon for two independent samples generated a rank sum of 91,50 for CCD-patients, and of 79,50 for the control group. The Z-value was 3,246, the p-value 0,005.  Fisher's exact test  identified a p-value of 0,0003. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of collagen I in the oral mucosa seems to be increased significantly in CCD.

The responsible gene has been identified as RUNX2. CCD is also accompanied by characteristic dental abnormalities, e.g. supernumerary teeth, delayed eruption and impaction of permanent teeth. Intrafamilial variations of skeletal abnormalities are reported but those of dental abnormalities are obscure. To clarify this point, a precise examination of the dental features of CCD siblings having identical mutation was performed. DESIGN: Gene mutational analysis of three Japanese CCD siblings and their father was performed. Skeletal and dental characteristics were examined by the inquiry and radiographs. RESULTS: Three siblings uniformly showed patent fontanelles and short stature. They and their father had a novel missense mutation in the RUNT-domain (P210S) of RUNX2. The siblings were completely discordant for the dental characteristics with the position and number of supernumerary teeth being completely different. The youngest, a 12-year-old boy, had six supernumerary teeth, which appeared symmetrically around the maxillary canines and mandibular premolars. The second, a 15-year-old girl, had four supernumerary teeth which appeared around the mandibular incisors. The oldest, a 17-year-old boy, had 11 supernumerary teeth, which were symmetrically around the mandibular lateral dentition and asymmetrically around the maxillary incisors and premolars. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests the involvement of non-genetic or epigenetic regulation in supernumerary tooth formation in CCD.",M2

The disease gene is CBFA1/RUNX2, which is mapped to chromosome 6p21. Inactivation of the CBFA1/RUNX2 gene by mutations is involved in the skeletal defects that occur in patients with CCD. CBFA1/RUNX2 controls the differentiation of precursor cells into osteoblasts and is essential for membranous as well as endochondral bone formation. In this study of a 14-yr-old boy with typical CCD phenotype, the authors found a novel CBFA1/RUNX2 gene mutation. All of the amplified segments from the patient's CBFA1/RUNX2 gene were identical to those obtained in controls, except for the one spanning the exon 7 and intron/exon boundary regions. Direct sequencing of the PCR product showed a heterozygous T-to-A transition mutation at nucleotide 1182 in exon 7, leading to Y394X mutation.

METHODS: This article demonstrates the usefulness of titanium screws for orthodontic anchorage to induce eruption of the impacted teeth in a patient with CCD. A boy, aged 10 years 11 months, had a number of impacted permanent teeth. After the supernumerary teeth were extracted and the incisors were surgically exposed, 2 titanium screws were placed in the palate without incisions or flap surgery. After implantation, a lingual arch appliance was placed, and orthodontic load began 4 weeks after surgery with an elastic chain. RESULTS: After 4 months of traction, 3 impacted incisors had erupted into the mouth. CONCLUSIONS: This new method for retraction of impacted teeth can reduce the patient's treatment time and psychological stress. Treatment with titanium screws for traction of impacted teeth might be a new treatment strategy for managing CCD patients.",M2

17290219,"Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles.Monoallelic RUNX1 mutations cause familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic mono- and biallelic mutations are found at high frequencies in AML M0, in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and AML, and in isolated cases of AML M2, M5a, M3 relapse, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles. We conclude that hypomorphic RUNX2 alleles can cause CCD, whereas hematopoietic disease requires more severely inactivating RUNX1 mutations.",M2

We describe the case report of a girl with cleidocranial dysostosis (CCD), and comorbid intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and suggest the possible existence of a behavioural phenotype. We also highlight the lack of an evidence base for the management of ADHD within the learning-disability population, and describe successful management utilizing the current evidence base, which exists for those of average intellectual ability.",M2
17051365,"[Cleidocranial dysplasia. Description and analysis of a patient cohort]BACKGROUND: Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is a rare dysplasia of bony and dental tissue. Characteristic are typical craniofacial and dental findings including morphological anomalies. CCD is possibly the only general syndrome that can be diagnosed based on the dental findings alone. CCD correlates with mutations in the RUNX2 gene. PURPOSE: The present interdisciplinary study correlates phenotypic findings with genetic variations in the corresponding gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The coding sequence of the RUNX2 gene from 31 CCD patients from 20 families was analyzed using molecular genetic methods including polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The craniofacial and dental findings of each patient were evaluated according to a standardized scoring scheme and tested with homogeneity analysis for general phenotypic findings. RESULTS: Several mutations of the RUNX2 gene were identified. Depending on the mutation type, they showed different distribution patterns within the gene coinciding with the functional domains of the gene product. With homogeneity analysis of the phenotype cardinal (especially dental findings) and minor findings (pneumatization disturbances, Wormian bones) were identified. In combination with the genetic data, the statistical analysis showed that loss-of-function mutations of the RUNX2 gene result in a milder markedness of the CCD phenotype than gain-of-function or decrease-of-function mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We found that type and location of a specific mutation within the RUNX2 gene might have an impact on the expressivity of CCD. Due to the limited sampling size this hypothesis must be verified by investigations in larger patient groups.",M2
17023750,"Cleidocranial dysplasia: importance of radiographic images in diagnosis of the condition.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is a rare syndrome usually caused by an autosomal dominant gene, although 40% of cases of CCD appear spontaneously with no apparent genetic cause. This condition is characterized by several cranial malformations and underdevelopment, absence of the clavicles, and multiple supernumerary and impacted permanent teeth. The diagnosis of this condition is usually based on the presence of the main features (supernumerary teeth, partial or total absence of one or both the clavicles, and bony malformations) and on clinical and familial evidence. The bony and dental features of CCD may be visualized on radiographic images of the face and skull. Here, we present a familial case of CCD and discuss the importance of dental radiographs in diagnosis of the condition.",M2

16463420,"Cleidocranial dysplasia with severe parietal bone dysplasia: C-terminal RUNX2 mutations.BACKGROUND: Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia syndrome that is characterized by widely patent calvarial sutures, clavicular hypoplasia, supernumerary teeth, and short stature. CCD is caused by mutations in the transcription factor RUNX2, which is known to function as a major regulator of bone differentiation. Despite the characterization of 67 unique mutations in 97 individual cases, and the availability of animal models, no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation has emerged. METHODS: We describe 3 new cases that were ascertained on the basis of a severe calvarial phenotype, that were associated with 3 novel mutations in the C-terminal region of RUNX2 distal to the DNA-binding runt domain. In addition, a review of all previously described cases was undertaken in an effort to standardize mutation nomenclature, characterize the position of known mutations relative to the runt domain, and explore the hypothesis that C-terminal mutations that preserve the runt domain may lead to more-severe craniofacial phenotypes. RESULTS: Upon mutational analysis of RUNX2, we identified either frameshift or splice-site mutations that affect the C-terminal region of the resultant protein distal to the runt domain. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of previously described mutations, these cases suggest that C-terminal mutations that preserve the DNA-binding runt domain while disrupting the SMAD 1,2,3,5 binding domain and the nuclear matrix targeting signal may be responsible for the severe phenotype observed.",M2
16327567,"Cleidocranial dysplasia: diagnostic criteria and combined treatment.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an uncommon, generalized skeletal disorder characterized by delayed ossification of the skull, aplastic or hypoplastic clavicles, and serious, complex dental abnormalities. There are many difficulties in the early diagnosis of CCD because a majority of the craniofacial abnormalities becomes obvious only during adolescence. In the present case, a hypoplastic midface, a relative prognathia of the mandible, and close approximation of the shoulders in the anterior plane were the conspicuous extraoral findings. Prolonged exfoliation of the primary dentition, unerupted supernumerary teeth, and the irregularly and partially erupted secondary dentition produced occlusional anomalies. The presence of the second permanent molars together with the primary dentition and wide spacing in the lower incisor area were typical dental signs. Gradual extraction of the supernumerary teeth and over-retained primary teeth was the first step of oral surgery. This was followed by a surgical exposure of the unerupted teeth by thinning of the cortical bone. Orthodontic treatment was aimed at parallel growth of the jaws. Removable appliances were used to expand the narrow maxillary and mandibular arches, and a Delaire mask compensated for the lack of sagittal growth of the upper jaw. Temporary functional rehabilitation was solved by partial denture. When the jaws have been fully developed, implant insertions and bridges are the therapeutic measures. The reported case and the literature data support the importance of the early diagnosis and interdisciplinary treatment of CCD.",M2

16270353,"Four novel RUNX2 mutations including a splice donor site result in the cleidocranial dysplasia phenotype.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the RUNX2 gene. In this study, we analyzed by direct sequencing RUNX2 mutations from eleven CCD patients. Four of seven mutations were novel: two nonsense mutations resulted in a translational stop at codon 50 (Q50X) and 112 (E112X); a missense mutation converted arginine to glycine at codon 131 (R131G); and an exon 1 splice donor site mutation (donor splice site GT/AT, IVS1 + 1G &gt; A) at exon 1-intron junction resulted in the deletion of QA stretch contained in exon 1 of RUNX2. We focused on the functional analysis of the IVS1 + 1G &gt; A mutation. A full-length cDNA of this mutation was cloned (RUNX2Deltae1) and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HeLa cells. Functional analysis of RUNX2Deltae1 was performed with respect to protein stability, nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transactivation activity of a downstream RUNX2 target gene. Protein stability of RUNX2Deltae1 is similar to wild-type RUNX2 as determined by Western blot analysis. Subcellular localization of RUNX2Deltae1, assessed by in situ immunofluorescent staining, was observed with partial retention in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. This finding is in contrast to RUNX2 wild-type, which is detected exclusively in the nucleus. DNA binding activity was also compromised by the RUNX2Deltae1 in gel shift assay. Finally, RUNX2Deltae1 blocked transactivation of the osteocalcin gene determined by transient transfection assay. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the CCD phenotype can be caused by a splice site mutation, which results in the deletion of N-terminus amino acids containing the QA stretch in RUNX2 that contains a previously unidentified second nuclear localization signal (NLS). We postulate that the QA sequence unique to RUNX2 contributes to a competent structure of RUNX2 that is required for nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transactivation function.",M2
16244783,"Functional analysis of a novel RUNX2 missense mutation found in a family with cleidocranial dysplasia.Mutations of the RUNX2 gene result in dominantly inherited cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>). RUNX2 encodes for an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, which recognizes specific DNA sequences by the runt domain. DNA binding is stabilized by the interaction with the protein CBFbeta, which induces structural modifications of the runt domain. A novel 574G &gt; A RUNX2 missense mutation has been found in members of a family clinically diagnosed with CCD. This mutation causes the glycine at position 192 to change to arginine (G192R), in loop 9 of the runt domain. Unlike other residues of loop 9, G192 does not establish DNA contacts. Accordingly, the G192R mutant showed a 50% reduction in binding activity compared to the wild-type runt domain. However, the mutation completely abolished the activating properties of the protein on osteocalcin promoter. Moreover, the G192R mutant exerts a dominant-negative effect when overexpressed. Computer modeling indicated that the G192R mutation perturbs not only loop 9, but also other parts of the runt domain, suggesting impairment of the interaction with CBFbeta.",M2
16222673,"Cleidocranial dysplasia: molecular genetic analysis and phenotypic-based description of a Middle European patient group.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) (OMIM 119600) is a rare dysplasia of osseous and dental tissue. Characteristic features are typical facial and dental appearance plus morphologic anomalies. RUNX2 (OMIM 600211), the responsible gene for CCD, is considered to be a master gene for bone development and bone homeostasis. This study describes the genotype-phenotype correlation based on craniofacial features involving an interdisciplinary approach. Our patient cohort consisted of 31 CCD patients from 20 families; five patients from two families were unavailable for clinical examination. Since CCD mostly affects the craniofacial region, phenotypic characterization of each individual focused on craniofacial and dental aspects. After recording patient medical and family history, the phenotypic data was analyzed using homogeneity analysis (HOMALS), a statistical procedure for data reduction in categorical data analysis. The coding sequence of the RUNX2 gene was analyzed using PCR, direct sequencing, and restriction endonuclease digestion. Eight unpublished and four known heterozygous mutations in a total of 14/20 index patients (70%) were identified. In total, we detected 7 missense mutations, 5 frameshift mutations, and 2 nonsense mutations in 14 index patients (35%, 25%, 10%, respectively). The overall CCD phenotype varied from mild to fullblown expression. Using HOMALS, we were able to discriminate four groups of patients showing significant differences in phenotypic expressivity, thereby simplifying the grouping of our large patient cohort into clear distinguishable entities. Analysis of the mutation patterns revealed that mutational frequency and types of mutations found can be attributed to the gene's structure and function.",M2

The authors report a Chinese girl with CCD in whom the mutation in RUNX 2 was identified. METHODS: Clinical diagnosis was based on physical examination, radiological findings, and biochemical tests. For mutation detection, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard method. All 7 coding exons of RUNX 2 and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were then subjected to automatic DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The affected girl showed typical clinical manifestations of CCD, including patent fontanelles, absent clavicles, short stature and dental anomalies. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments revealed a recurrent missense mutation, R190W (568 C &gt; T), in RUNX 2. The mutation was further confirmed by Hae III restriction analysis. CONCLUSION: A Chinese case of CCD was confirmed and the disease-causing mutation was linked to a recurrent point mutation in RUNX 2.",M2
16143022,"Holoprosencephaly and cleidocranial dysplasia in a patient due to two position-effect mutations: case report and review of the literature.Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a genetically heterogeneous developmental field defect in which midline cleavage of the forebrain and craniofacial structures is impaired. Based on the analysis of HPE patients with chromosome rearrangements, at least six loci for the disorder have been assigned. The sonic hedgehog gene (SHH) at 7q36 has been identified as the HPE3 locus. Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by clavicular, pelvic and dental anomalies. It is caused by mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor CBFA1/RUNX2, which maps to 6p21. We report a 20-year-old female with premaxillary agenesis (part of the HPE spectrum), as well as skeletal abnormalities and impacted teeth reminiscent of CCD. She carries a de novo 6;7 reciprocal translocation, with breakpoints at 6p21.1 and 7q36. We have shown previously that the 7q36 breakpoint maps 15 kb telomeric to the 5' end of SHH, which explains the patient's HPE phenotype. Now, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have identified a P1 artificial chromosome clone 800 kb upstream of CBFA1/RUNX2 that spans the 6p breakpoint. We propose that the proband's complex phenotype is due to two position-effect (PE) mutations, one at each translocation breakpoint, which have altered the expression of the SHH and CBFA1/RUNX2 genes. The role of PE mutations in human disease is also reviewed.",M2
15952089,"Dysregulation of chondrogenesis in human cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia caused by heterozygosity of mutations in human RUNX2. The disorder is characterized by delayed closure of the fontanel and hypoplastic clavicles that result from defective intramembranous ossification. However, additional features, such as short stature and cone epiphyses, also suggest an underlying defect in endochondral ossification. Here, we report observations of growth-plate abnormalities in a patient with a novel RUNX2 gene mutation, a single C insertion (1228insC), which is predicted to lead to a premature termination codon and thus to haploinsufficiency of RUNX2 and the CCD phenotype. Histological analysis of the rib and long-bone cartilages showed a markedly diminished zone of hypertrophy. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of limb cartilage RNA showed a 5-10-fold decrease in the hypertrophic chondrocyte molecular markers VEGF, MMP13, and COL10A1. Together, these data show that humans with CCD have altered endochondral ossification due to altered RUNX2 regulation of hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific genes during chondrocyte maturation.",M2
15721154,"Altered gene expression in human cleidocranial dysplasia dental pulp cells.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by defects of bone and tooth development. The dental manifestations in CCD patients include supernumerary teeth, delayed tooth eruption, tooth hypoplasia and absence of cellular cementum formation. This disorder is associated with mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2. To identify morphological and molecular alterations associated with CCD dental tissues, human primary dental pulp cell cultures were established from age- and sex-matched CCD and normal patients. Dental pulp cells were compared for general morphology, proliferation rates, and gene expression profiles using cDNA microarray technology. CCD pulp cells were about four-fold larger than normal cells, however the normal pulp proliferation rates were two- and three-fold greater at time points tested than the CCD cells. Of the 226 genes analysed by blot microarray, 18.6% displayed significant differences at least two-fold in expression levels. This includes 25 genes (11.1%) that were up-regulated, while 17 (7.5%) that were down-regulated in the CCD cells as compared to the normal cells. Expression of selected genes was further verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Comparison between the CDD and normal cells revealed that gene expression of cytokines and growth factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGF-betaRII) and vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) were higher while bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was lower in the CCD cells. Furthermore, potential Runx2 binding sites were found in all putative target gene promoters. This study suggests that in addition to bone and tooth cell differentiation, Runx2 may be involved in controlling cell growth during tooth development.",M2

In CCD patients (a) the masseter muscles were less thick than in age- and sex-matched control subjects, (b) the zygomatic arch was discontinuous with the hypoplastic zygomatic bone, (c) the ascending ramus of the mandible had parallel-sided borders, and (d) the coronoid process pointed upwards and/or posteriorly.

15099800,"Delayed tooth eruption and suppressed osteoclast number in the eruption pathway of heterozygous Runx2/Cbfa1 knockout mice.Genetic studies have recently identified a mutation of one allele of runt-related gene 2 (RUNX2/CBFA1) as the cause for an autosomal-dominant skeletal disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>), which is characterised by hypoplasia of the clavicles and calvariae and widened sutures and fontanelles. In addition, CCD is frequently affected with multiple supernumerary teeth and the impaction and delayed eruption of teeth, the causes of all these dental abnormalities are still unknown. To clarify the cellular mechanism of the delayed tooth eruption in CCD, the process of tooth eruption was examined in heterozygous Runx2/Cbfa1 (mouse homolog of RUNX2/CBFA1) knockout mice, known to mimic most of the bone abnormalities of CCD. The timing of the appearance of maxillary and mandibular teeth into the oral cavity was significantly delayed in heterozygous mutant mice compared with wild-type mice. From postnatal days 8 to 10, an active alveolar bone resorption and a marked increase of the osteoclast surfaces was observed in the eruption pathway of both genotypes, but this increase was significantly suppressed in the mutant mice. In contrast, the osteoclast surfaces did not show a significant difference between the two genotypes in the future cortical area of femora. These results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Runx2/Cbfa1 does not effect the femoral bone remodelling but is insufficient for the active alveolar bone resorption essential for the prompt timing of tooth eruption. These results also suggest the possibility that impaired recruitment of osteoclasts is one of the cellular mechanisms of delayed tooth eruption in CCD patients.",M2

METHODS: The study comprises two elements, a complete series of all diagnosed patients at the Center for Craniofacial Genetics at the University of Regensburg, Germany, and a SR. Relevant literature was identified by electronic databases, review of citation lists and hand searching of key journals. The principal selection criterion was that the study should contain as many pertinent cases as possible. The presented signs and symptoms were assigned to the following categories:  supernumerary teeth ,  failure of eruption ,  hypoplastic maxilla  and  clavicular sign . Additionally, the family history was taken into account. RESULTS: From the 410 English, German or French articles, 40 single case presentations and 17 multiple case studies remained that met the selection criteria. This report reviews the data of 283 patients with CCD including our own patient cohort of 24 individuals. Dental signs such as supernumerary teeth and eruption failure were expressed in over 93.5%. Skeletal symptoms such as hypoplastic maxilla and the clavicular sign were exhibited in over 84.3%. The prevalence of spontaneous mutations differs slightly when comparing the single case studies (72.0%) with our patient data (58.3%). The fraction of spontaneous mutations in multiple case studies was 5.0%. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of CCD can be difficult when typical features are not clearly expressed. Since the multiple case studies concentrated on specific clinical aspects, an overall ranking including all associated findings was not possible. Owing to their prevalence, we recommend referencing to the described list of clinical signs as major symptoms for the pathognomy in CCD, since they are infrequent in other conditions and in the general population. To categorize the expression of CCD, more interdisciplinary studies are necessary. Nevertheless, a subjective classification is possible according to the related restrictions in the patients' quality of life.",M2
14706028,"Early craniofacial signs of cleidocranial dysplasia.OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of <e>CCD</e> is essential for a timely introduction of the appropriate treatment approach. Since certain symptoms first fully manifest only during the pubertal growth spurt, their indicatory signs are often overlooked. The aim of this study is to describe the initial craniofacial findings in patients with CCD in order to categorise their reliability for early detection. METHOD: 14 patients with CCD between the ages of 6 and 11 years who were referred to the University of Regensburg over a 4-year period were included in this study. The patients were examined clinically and radiologically and their dental status was determined. Typical signs of CCD were analysed according to such classic criteria as the 'quatermoon'-physiognomy described in the literature. The clinical findings were compared to medical data and case history. RESULTS: Early signs were registered for each patient. While some signs could be found in all patients, others were variably expressed. The typical extraoral symptoms were only rarely exhibited in our patient population. CONCLUSION: As various indicators of CCD are age related, their expression should be taken into account for early diagnosis. Apparent signs only manifest during the growth spurt when the ideal timeframe for beginning treatment has already past. The symptoms described should serve as early markers to aid the general and paediatric dentist in planning appropriate treatment or referring patients to specialised centres.",M2

The condition is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait and the human CBFA1 gene has been identified as the CCD gene. We describe a prenatal form of the skeletal disorder that included clavicular hypoplasia, absence of ossification of the cranial parietal bones and very poor ossification of the frontal and pubic bones. Growth restriction affecting only the long bones was also noted. The fetal karyotype revealed an apparently de novo balanced t(2q;6q)(q36;q16) translocation. This particular form of skeletal disorder associated with the absence of family history and an apparently de novo balanced translocation led the parents to opt for termination of the pregnancy.",M2

So far, only two families have been reported and the molecular basis of the disorder is unknown. We present a third family with PFMCCD, comprising four affected individuals in three generations, and demonstrate that a heterozygous tetranucleotide duplication in the MSX2 homeobox gene (505_508dupATTG) segregates with the phenotype. PFMCCD is indeed aetiologically distinct from CCD, which is caused by mutations in the RUNX2 gene, but allelic with isolated PFM, in which MSX2 mutations were previously identified. Our observations highlight the role of MSX2 in clavicular development and the importance of radiological examination of the clavicles in subjects with PFM.",M2
12888002,"Tooth eruption and cementum formation in the Runx2/Cbfa1 heterozygous mouse.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant human disorder that affects development of bones and teeth. The dental disorders in CCD patients include formation of supernumerary teeth, delayed tooth eruption, and lack of formation of cellular cementum in permanent teeth. This disorder involves a mutation in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1, leading to haploinsufficiency of the Runx2/Cbfa1 protein. Here, we examined if Runx2/Cbfa1 heterozygous mice (with one functional allele for Runx2/Cbfa1) exhibit similar changes in tooth eruption, and dental cementum formation as in CCD patients. Heads of Runx2/Cbfa1 heterogeneous and wildtype mice aged days 16-35 postnatally were serially sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to identify osteoclasts. The results showed that the eruption pattern of the first and second molars in maxilla and mandible in Runx2/Cbfa1 +/- mice was the same as in wildtype animals. No clear difference in distribution or in the (estimated) number of osteoclasts was found. Cellular cement at the apical portions of the molar roots was present in both groups. The data suggests that in the mouse one allele for Runx2/Cbfa1 is sufficient for an undisturbed tooth eruption and an apparently normal formation of the periodontium.",M2

12732182,"Functional analysis of RUNX2 mutations in cleidocranial dysplasia: novel insights into genotype-phenotype correlations.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an inherited autosomal-dominant skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor, RUNX2. We have performed mutational analysis of RUNX2 on 24 unrelated patients with CCD. In 17 patients, 16 distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: 4 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 6 missense, and 2 splicing mutations alongside one polymorphism. The missense mutations were all clustered within the Runt domain and their protein products showed neither DNA binding nor transactivation. On the other hand, some mutant RUNX2 had the Runt domain intact and remained partially competent for transactivation. Coincidentally, one important phenotype of CCD, the short stature, was significantly milder in the patients with the intact Runt domain than those without. Furthermore, a remarkable correlation was found between the short stature and the number of supernumerary teeth. On the other hand, the classic CCD phenotype, hypoplastic clavicles or open fontanelles, was invariably observed regardless of the degree of short stature or supernumerary teeth. Overall, these results suggest that CCD could result from a much smaller loss in the RUNX2 function than envisioned on the basis of the conventional haploinsufficiency model. This makes an interesting contrast to the case of familial and sporadic leukemias mediated by RUNX1 mutations, in which mutants acting in a dominant negative manner have been suggested to confer a higher propensity to develop leukemia.",M2

Different mutations of the RUNX2/CBFA1 gene (MIM 600211) have been detected in patients with CCD. We investigated a mother and daughter with features of CCD presenting with reduced plasma alkaline phosphatase activity, increased urinary phosphoethanolamine excretion and decreased bone density. The latter findings were suggestive of hypophophatasia but mutation analysis showed no mutation in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase gene (TNSALP; MIM 171760). However, a heterozygous mutation (Arg169Pro caused by nucleotide change 506G &gt; C) was detected in the RUNX2 gene. Metabolic alterations gradually improved in both mother and daughter but bone-specific alkaline phosphatase remained low (less than 30% of normal) and mild phosphoethanolaminuria persisted. Recent studies in the Cbfa1 knock-out mouse showed decreased expression of alkaline phosphatase in differentiating bone. CONCLUSION: we suggest that the observed metabolic alterations are secondary to the RUNX2 gene mutation affecting early bone maturation and turnover. This is the first description of biochemical findings of hypophosphatasia in patients with cleidocranial dysplasia.",M2

We present an 18-year-old-patient with untypical CCD expression who was misdiagnosed with RTS at the age of 2 years. An extensive craniofacial examination was carried out with respect to morphological and dental aspects. The molecular-genetic analysis of two underlying genes (CBFA1 and CBP) for CCD and RTS was performed using SSCP, direct sequencing and FISH. While the clinical examination showed uncharacteristic CCD symptoms with some findings common for RTS, the molecular-genetic analysis revealed a missense mutation in the CBFA1 gene, which is considered to be the etiological factor for CCD. Our findings with this patient presented clear evidence for the wide morphologic variety that can be related to a certain gene such as CBFA1. The diagnosis of rare diseases is currently based on the clinical phenomenology of small groups or single cases. The use of molecular-genetic biology extends the horizon of diagnostic and scientific possibilities. In this patient, it allowed us to compare the clinically diagnosis to molecular-genetic data. We conclude that molecular-genetic analysis may be a helpful tool in the differential diagnosis of many congenital diseases such as CCD and RTS.",M2

12196916,"Functional analysis of RUNX2 mutations in Japanese patients with cleidocranial dysplasia demonstrates novel genotype-phenotype correlations.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant heritable skeletal disease caused by heterozygous mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor RUNX2. We have performed mutational analysis of RUNX2 on 24 unrelated patients with CCD. In 17 patients, 16 distinct mutations were detected in the coding region of RUNX2: 4 frameshift, 3 nonsense, 6 missense, and 2 splicing mutations, in addition to 1 polymorphism. The missense mutations were all clustered within the Runt domain, and their protein products were severely impaired in DNA binding and transactivation. In contrast, two RUNX2 mutants had the Runt domain intact and remained partially competent for transactivation. One criterion of CCD, short stature, was much milder in the patients with the intact Runt domain than in those without. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between short stature and the number of supernumerary teeth. On the one hand, these genotype-phenotype correlations highlight a general, quantitative dependency, by skeleto-dental developments, on the gene dosage of RUNX2, which has hitherto been obscured by extreme clinical diversities of CCD; this gene-dosage effect is presumed to manifest on small reductions in the total RUNX2 activity, by approximately one-fourth of the normal level at minimum. On the other hand, the classic CCD phenotype, hypoplastic clavicles or open fontanelles, was invariably observed in all patients, including those with normal height. Thus, the cleidocranial bone formation, as mediated by intramembranous ossification, may require a higher level of RUNX2 than does skeletogenesis (mediated by endochondral ossification), as well as odontogenesis (involving still different complex processes). Overall, these results suggest that CCD could result from much smaller losses in the RUNX2 function than has been envisioned on the basis of the conventional haploinsufficiency model.",M2

MR imaging revealed a global vermian hypoplasia with marked cortical dysplasia. CCD was associated with a voluminous heterotopic mass. The postmortem neuropathologic study confirmed vermian hypoplasia and CCD, which consisted of right cerebellar cortical polymicrogyria with subcortical heterotopia.

12081718,"New mutations in the CBFA1 gene in two Mexican patients with cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder exhibiting a wide clinical spectrum ranging from minimal anomalies to classic CCD. Mutations scattered throughout the entire CBFA1 gene have been related to this disorder. However, it seems that most of them affect the highly conserved Runt domain, abolishing the DNA-binding ability of this transcription factor. Moreover, no systematic effect has been found to relate the type of mutation to the severity of the clinical features. In this paper, we studied two unrelated patients with classic CCD. DNA analysis revealed two novel mutations and three undescribed polymorphisms. One of the substitutions was a missense mutation in the Q/A domain leading to the replacement of a polar residue by a nonpolar one (158 A --&gt; T [Q53L]). The second was an uncommon heterozygous stop codon mutation (1565 G --&gt; C [X522S]) which theoretically results in a longer protein with 23 additional amino acids. This is the first report of this type of mutation in CBFA1. We discuss the possible consequences of these mutant sequences, although no phenotype-genotype correlation could be established. Our findings expand the existing number of allelic variants in this pathology.",M2

The locus for this disease was mapped to chromosome 6p21. RUNX2 is a member of the runt family of transcription factors and its expression is restricted to developing osteoblasts and a subset of chondrocytes. Mutations in the RUNX2 gene have been shown to cause CCD. Chromosomal translocations, deletions, insertions, nonsense and splice-site mutations, as well as missense mutations of the RUNX2 gene have been described in CCD patients. Although there is a wide spectrum in phenotypic variability ranging from primary dental anomalies to all CCD features plus osteoporosis, no clear phenotype-genotype correlation has been established.

We identified novel CBFAI/RUNX2 mutations after PCR and direct sequencing of patient leukocyte DNA. In family 1 mother and son are affected by CCD. Both carry the missense mutation R190W (CGG &gt; TGG). This nucleotide change introduced a BsmI restriction site, which was used to independently confirm the mutation. It was absent in healthy members of the family. Family 2, in which father and daughter are affected by CCD, shows a deletion of nucleotide C821. This deletion causes a frameshift mutation with premature stop after the insertion of 18 aberrant amino acids. Healthy family members did not have this mutation.

Clinical characteristics associated with CCD have previously been described in case reports and small case series. This study was undertaken to gain a more complete delineation of clinical complications associated with CCD. The study population was composed of 90 CCD individuals and 56 relative controls ascertained from genetic and dental practices in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. A number of previously unrecognized complications were significantly increased including: genua valga, scoliosis, pes planus, sinus infections, upper respiratory complications, recurrent otitis media, and hearing loss. Primary Cesarean section rate was significantly increased compared to relative controls and the general population rate. Finally, dental abnormalities, including supernumerary teeth, failure of exfoliation of the primary dentition, and malocclusion, are serious and complex problems that require intervention.

The patient was a 47-year-old woman, who had 10 erupted permanent teeth and 2 partially erupted and 19 completely impacted teeth, including supernumerary teeth. The erupted right upper premolar was extracted and observed using a light microscope and an electron probe X-ray microanalyzer (EPMA). Findings showed enamel hypoplasia, predominantly irregular globular dentin and Tomes' granular layer, and a complete lack of cellular cementum in the ground section. The incremental von Ebner and counter Owen lines were obscure. Comparative quantitative analysis using the EPMA showed that the quantities of calcium and phosphate were lower in the enamel and dentin than those of the control sample.",M2

The cementum of 2 permanent teeth, which had been extracted from the CCD subject, was examined and histomorphometrically analyzed for comparison to the cementum of 10 anterior teeth that had been extracted from individuals who were unaffected by CCD. The percentage of the root covered by cellular or acellular cementum was quantified to determine if patients affected by CCD typically lack cellular cementum. In the roots of the 2 permanent teeth of the subject with CCD, a mean of 18.05 +/- 10.67% was covered by cellular cementum and 76.90 +/- 3.53% was covered by acellular cementum. In the 10 permanent teeth from subjects without CCD, a mean of 19.12 +/- 15.60% of the root was covered by cellular cementum and 80.34 +/- 15.71% was covered by acellular cementum. The findings indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the amount of either cellular or acellular cementum covering the roots of the study subject with CCD and the roots of the 10 control teeth. The presumption that a lack of cellular cementum causes the increased number of unerupted teeth in patients with CCD is not supported by the findings of this study.",M2

To understand the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of CCD, we studied a novel mutant of RUNX2, namely CCDalphaA376, originally identified in a CCD patient. The nonsense mutation, which resulted in a truncated RUNX2 protein, severely impaired RUNX2 transactivation activity. We showed that signal transducers of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors, Smads, interact with RUNX2 in vivo and in vitro and enhance transactivation ability. The truncated RUNX2 protein failed to interact with Smads, and was unable to induce the osteoblast-like phenotype in C2C12 myoblasts following stimulation with BMP. Exogenous expression of Smads 1 and 4 in C2C12 cells stably expressing RUNX2 showed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, suggesting a possible link between Smads and RUNX2, while in C2C12 stably expressing CCDalphaA376, a detectable level of ALP activity failed to be induced. The results suggest that CCDalphaA376 inhibited RUNX2 function in a dominant negative fashion.",M2

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cranial MRI in 7 patients with CCD (4 women/3 men aged between 8 and 46 years) was performed. In two patients hearing disorders were present. The examinations encompassed multi-planar spinecho sequences of the cerebellopontine angle in 3-mm slice thickness before and after administration of contrast medium. RESULTS: The clinically most conspicuous female patient (hearing loss, ataxia, headache) showed a strongly contrast-enhancing tumor in MRI that was histologically proved to be an acoustic schwannoma.

Recently, we found a novel frameshift mutation 383-T-insertion (S128F) in exon 3 in the CBFA1 gene of a Japanese classic CCD patient. We describe our detailed investigation of the patient with CCD associated with the CBFA1 mutation. The patient showed the characteristic expression of CCD, such as dysplasia of the clavicles, patent fontanelles, short stature, impacted supernumerary teeth, and delayed eruption of the permanent teeth. In addition to these characteristics, orthopantomography delayed ossification of the mandibular symphysis and a three-dimensional computed tomograph (3D-CT) analysis showed hypoplasia of the zygomatic arch.

Five members of a family with CCD were characterized clinically. X-rays and photographs of the two clinically affected family members were taken. The genotype of all five affected family members was determined with the use of single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing. A point-mutation in exon 2 (R148G) was detected in a patient with the full-blown clinical phenotype. His son, demonstrating the same mutation, showed only the dental CCD characteristics.

10813178,"The 'chef's hat' appearance of the femoral head in cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by failure of membranous ossification. The condition is due to a mutation of the cbfa1 gene on chromosome 6 which has a role in the development of osteoblasts from the mesenchymal cells. In their growing years, these patients have an unusual shape of the femoral head reminiscent of a 'chef's hat'. In order to confirm the consistency of this sign, we have reviewed the radiographs of 28 patients with CCD. All except three had this appearance. The sign was also seen in patients with coxa vara associated with a variety of other conditions. The chef's hat sign may occur secondary to the particular mechanical environment created by coxa vara as well as abnormal cellular function in patients with CCD. Although coxa vara has some influence on the shape of the femoral head, it is not entirely responsible for its morphology since it was present in only six of the 28 patients with CCD.",M2
10689183,"PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 mutations in Japanese cleidocranial dysplasia patients.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant human bone disease whose genetic locus has been located on chromosome 6p21, where the PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 gene essential for osteogenesis also maps. Previously, several heterozygous mutations in PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 were found in CCD patients. In this study, we identified six different types of mutations in PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 in Japanese CCD patients. Four cases were similar to those reported previously: two were nonsense mutations in the Runt domain, one was a hemizygous deletion, and the other was a missense mutation in the Runt domain which abolished the DNA-binding activity of Runx2/PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1. The remaining two mutations were novel: one had a heterozygous gt-to-tt mutation at the splice donor site (gt) between the exon3-intron junction, which resulted in abnormal exon3 skipping, and the other had a mutation in exon7, which led to the introduction of a translational stop codon in the middle of the transactivation domain. Thus, defects in either the DNA-binding domain or transactivation domain of Runx2/PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 can cause CCD. The results not only provide a strong genetic evidence that mutations involving in PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 contribute to CCD, but also provide a useful tool to study how Runx2/PEBP2alphaA/CBFA1 plays its pivotal role during osteoblastic differentiation.",M2
10545612,"CBFA1 mutation analysis and functional correlation with phenotypic variability in cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor CBFA1. To correlate CBFA1 mutations in different functional domains with the CCD clinical spectrum, we studied 26 independent cases of CCD and a total of 16 new mutations were identified in 17 families. The majority of mutations were de novo missense mutations that affected conserved residues in the runt domain and completely abolished both DNA binding and transactivation of a reporter gene. These, and mutations which result in premature termination in the runt domain, produced a classic CCD phenotype by abolishing transactivation of the mutant protein with consequent haploinsufficiency. We further identified three putative hypomorphic mutations (R391X, T200A and 90insC) which result in a clinical spectrum including classic and mild CCD, as well as an isolated dental phenotype characterized by delayed eruption of permanent teeth. Functional studies show that two of the three mutations were hypomorphic in nature and two were associated with significant intrafamilial variable expressivity, including isolated dental anomalies without the skeletal features of CCD. Together these data show that variable loss of function due to alterations in the runt and PST domains of CBFA1 may give rise to clinical variability, including classic CCD, mild CCD and isolated primary dental anomalies.",M2

We recently demonstrated that mutations in the transcription factor CBFA1, on chromosome 6p21, are associated with CCD. We have now analyzed the CBFA1 gene in 42 unrelated patients with CCD. In 18 patients, mutations were detected in the coding region of the CBFA1 gene, including 8 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 9 missense mutations, as well as 2 novel polymorphisms. A cluster of missense mutations at arginine 225 (R225) identifies this residue as crucial for CBFA1 function. In vitro green fluorescent protein fusion studies show that R225 mutations interfere with nuclear accumulation of CBFA1 protein. There is no phenotypic difference between patients with deletions or frameshifts and those with other intragenic mutations, suggesting that CCD is generally caused by haploinsufficiency. However, we were able to extend the CCD phenotypic spectrum. A missense mutation identified in one family with supernumerary teeth and a radiologically normal skeleton indicates that mutations in CBFA1 can be associated exclusively with a dental phenotype. In addition, one patient with severe CCD and a frameshift mutation in codon 402 had osteoporosis leading to recurrent bone fractures and scoliosis, providing first evidence that CBFA1 may help maintain adult bone, in addition to its function in bone development.",M2

The calvaria is defective and wormian bones are present. Abnormalities of the clavicles vary in severity from a minor unilateral defect to bilateral absence. This report concerns pre- and postmortem anatomical and radiological findings in a 15-day-old female neonate with CCD. Her postnatal course was characterized by seizures and recognition of hydrocephalus during the first day of life. The calvaria was hypoplastic with numerous wormian bones. A pseudofracture of the right clavicle was present. Hydrocephalus was present in the brachycephalic brain which had a severely thinned cerebral cortex. Hemosiderin in the ventricular lining and marked subependymal gliosis were interpreted as evidence of old intraventricular hemorrhage that had occurred in utero. A CCD-related condition, Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS), is noted for early lethality and for developmental and secondary abnormalities of the central nervous system.

Recently, a mouse model of CCD has been generated (Cbfal +/-) [Komori et al., 1997], and disturbances of osteoclast differentiation have been documented. It has been shown that these animals exhibit hypoplastic clavicles and nasal bones, and retarded ossification of parietal, interparietal, and supraoccipital bones. Humans with CCD show all these features, including severely retarded ossification of the cranial base, strongly suggesting that both intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification are affected. In addition, CCD patients have multiple supernumerary teeth and delayed tooth eruption. The present report presents 3D reconstructions of computerised tomography (CT) scans of the craniofacial region of a CCD boy examined at both 1 and 7 years of age. The anomalies in craniofacial skeleton and teeth are analysed and compared to the findings of our previous clinical studies and to the findings in the animal model.

The disease gene has been mapped to chromosome 6p21 within a region containing CBFA1, a member of the runt family of transcription factors. Mutations in the CBFA1 gene that presumably lead to synthesis of an inactive gene product were identified in patients with CCD. The function of CBFA1 during skeletal development was further elucidated by the generation of mutated mice in which the Cbfa1 gene locus was targeted. Loss of one Cbfa1 allele (+/-) leads to a phenotype very similar to human CCD, featuring hypoplasia of the clavicles and patent fontanelles. Loss of both alleles (-/-) leads to a complete absence of bone owing to a lack of osteoblast differentiation. These studies show that haploinsufficiency of CBFA1 causes the CCD phenotype. CBFA1 controls differentiation of precursor cells into osteoblasts and is thus essential for membranous as well as endochondral bone formation.",M2
9795736,"Delayed dental maturation in cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>), a rare, inherited, generalized, skeletal and dental dysplasia, exhibiting an autosomal dominant mode of transmission, may be associated with delays during tooth maturation. To test whether permanent tooth formation is delayed in patients with CCD and if the presence of supernumerary teeth adversely influences maturation of the dentition, a group of CCD patients (eight females, three males) was compared to an equal number of control subjects matched for age and gender. Dental maturity was assessed using panoramic radiographs and the Dental Maturity Ratio, (DMR = mean dental age divided by the chronological age) was calculated. The mean DMR in CCD patients (0.87 +/- 0.14) was lower than in the control group (1.06 +/- 0.14), p &lt; 0.01. Among patients with CCD, patients with supernumerary teeth, had a lower DMR (0.82 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.16), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. After adjusting for the presence of supernumerary teeth the diagnosis of CCD was still found to be associated with lower DMR than controls, p = 0.0569. We conclude that CCD patients have delayed tooth development of approximately 2.1 years and that among these patients, those with supernumerary teeth were further delayed by 1.5 years.",M2
9527313,"Characteristics of jaw growth in cleidocranial dysplasia.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess craniofacial morphology in young and adult individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>). DESIGN: Craniofacial morphology in young individuals (primary dentition) and in young adults was compared with control data using ratios and angles obtained from lateral head films. SETTING: The CCD individuals were referred to the Center for Craniofacial Anomalies for diagnostic workup and treatment recommendations. SUBJECTS: The sample consisted of 14 Caucasians. The inclusion criterion for the young, prepubertal group (A) was complete primary dentition, and for the adult, postpubertal group (B), the eruption of all four first molars was required. INTERVENTIONS: No treatment other than extraction or surgical removal of selected primary or supernumerary teeth was performed. RESULTS: Both groups showed significantly smaller anterior upper face height compared with controls. Group B subjects demonstrated significantly smaller face height values than the controls in the A point-nasion-B point (ANB) angle, facial axis, mandibular plane angle, palatal plane/mandibular plane angle, and gonial angle. No significant differences were found between group A individuals and the controls for these measurements. The older group had shorter anterior lower face height compared with both anterior upper face height and posterior lower face height. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas young CCD subjects showed relatively normal jaw proportions and morphology of the mandible, older CCD individuals tended to have short lower face height, acute gonial angle, anterior inclination of the mandible, and mandibular prognathism. These differences can be attributed to pronounced horizontal mandibular growth resulting from lack of vertical maxillary growth and impaired eruption of permanent teeth.",M2
9286593,"Mouse clavicular development: analysis of wild-type and cleidocranial dysplasia mutant mice.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hypoplasia or aplasia of clavicles, open fontanelles, and other skeletal anomalies. A mouse mutant, shown by clinical and radiographic analysis to be strikingly similar to the human disorder and designated Ccd, was used as a model for the human disorder. Since malformation of the clavicle is the hallmark of CCD, we studied clavicular development in wild-type and Ccd mice. Histology and in situ hybridization experiments were performed to compare the temporal and spatial expression of several genes in wild-type and Ccd mutant mouse embryos. Bone and cartilage specific markers--type I, II, and X collagens, Sox9, aggrecan, and osteopontin were used as probes. The analyses covered the development of the clavicle from the initial mesenchymal condensation at embryonic day 13 (E13) to the late mineralization stage at embryonic day 15.5. At day 13.5, cells in the center of the condensation differentiate into characteristic precursor cells that were not observed in other bone anlagen. In the medial part of the anlage these cells express markers of the early cartilage lineage (type II collagen and Sox9), whereas cells of the lateral part express markers of the osteoblast lineage (type I collagen). With further development the medial cells differentiate into chondrocytes and start to express chondrocyte-specific markers such as aggrecan. Cells of the lateral part differentiate into osteoblasts as indicated by the production of bone matrix and the expression of osteopontin. At day 14.5 a regular growth plate has developed between the two parts where type X collagen expression can be demonstrated in hypertrophic chondrocytes. The data indicate that the medial part of the clavicle develops by endochondral bone formation while the lateral part ossifies as a membranous bone. The clavicle of Ccd mice showed a smaller band of mesenchymal cell condensation than in wild-type mice. Cells of the condensation failed to express type I and type II collagen at E13.5. In the lateral part of the clavicle type I collagen expression was not detected until E14.5 and osteopontin expression only appeared at E15.5. At E15.5, a small ossification center appears in the lateral part which is, in contrast to the wild-type clavicular bone, solid and without primary spongiosa as well as bone marrow. In the medial portion, type II collagen expression and endochondral ossification never occurs in Ccd mice; this portion of the clavicle is therefore missing in Ccd.",M2
9268099,"Exclusion of BMP6 as a candidate gene for cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant, generalized skeletal dysplasia in humans that has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6. We report linkage of a CCD mutation to 6p21 in a large family and exclude the bone morphogenetic protein 6 gene (BMP6) as a candidate for the disease by cytogenetic localization and genetic recombination. CCD was linked with a maximal two-point LOD score of 7.22 with marker D6S452 at theta = 0. One relative with a recombination between D6S451 and D6S459 and another individual with a recombination between D6S465 and CCD places the mutation within a 7 cM region between D6S451 and D6S465 at 6p21. A phage P1 genomic clone spanning most of the BMP6 gene hybridized to chromosome 6 in band region p23-p24 using FISH analysis, placing this gene cytogenetically more distal than the region of linkage for CCD. We derived a new polymorphic marker from this same P1 clone and found recombinations between the marker and CCD in this family. The results confirm the map position of CCD on 6p21, further refine the CCD genetic interval by identifying a recombination between D6S451 and D6S459, and exclude BMP6 as a candidate gene.",M2
9207800,"Missense mutations abolishing DNA binding of the osteoblast-specific transcription factor OSF2/CBFA1 in cleidocranial dysplasia.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypoplastic or absent clavicles, large fontanelles, dental anomalies and delayed skeletal development. The phenotype is suggestive of a generalized defect in ossification and is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias not associated with disproportionate stature. To date, no genetic determinants of ossification have been identified. CCD has been mapped to chromosome 6p21, where CBFA1, a gene encoding OSF2/CBFA1, a transcriptional activator of osteoblast differentiation, has been localized. Here, we describe two de novo missense mutations, Met175Arg and Ser191Asn, in the OSF2/CBFA1 gene in two patients with CCD. These two mutations result in substitution of highly conserved amino acids in the DNA-binding domain. DNA-binding studies with the mutant polypeptides show that these amino acid substitutions abolish the DNA-binding ability of OSF2/CBFA1 to its known target sequence. Concurrent studies show that heterozygous nonsense mutations in OSF2/CBFA1 also result in CCD, while mice homozygous for the osf2/cbfa1 mull allele exhibit a more severe lethal phenotype. Thus, these results together suggest that CCD is produced by haploinsufficiency of OSF2/CBFA1 and provide direct genetic evidence that the phenotype is secondary to an alteration of osteoblast differentiation.",M2
8719350,"Histological observations of teeth and peridental tissues in cleidocranial dysplasia imply increased activity of odontogenic epithelium and abnormal bone remodeling.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is a heritable generalized bone dysplasia presenting with a variety of dental abnormalities. To delineate morphological features of the dental tissues, we have analyzed histologically the structure of teeth and peridental tissues obtained from four CCD patients. Dentin appeared regular, except when formed in response to caries, physiological attrition or root resorption. Both acellular and cellular cementum were present in deciduous teeth, whereas in permanent teeth, cellular cementum was virtually lacking and acellular cementum was partially hyperplastic. Enamel pearls were seen in the furcations of one deciduous and one permanent molar. The roots of most deciduous teeth were resorbed only to a slight extent. Morphologically, supernumerary teeth resembled their normal counterparts. Denticles as well as epithelial cell clusters were occasionally present in the root pulps of deciduous teeth. In the peridental tissues, epithelium was locally abundant, and the cytokeratin profile confirmed its odontogenic origin. While the organization pattern of the alveolar bone matrix related to unshed deciduous teeth and unerupted permanent teeth varied, woven bone was abundant. Both formative and resorption surfaces were seen. Also, reversal lines were prominent, suggesting that the bone had, in fact, undergone remodeling. While no direct association between the aberrant bone morphology and the multifarious histological abnormalities of dental tissues can be established, the local abundance of odontogenic epithelium in peridental tissues of developing/unerupted as well as fully developed teeth may be causally related to the formation of excess acellular cementum, enamel pearls and supernumerary teeth.",M2

However, the possibility of an autosomal recessive form of CCD has been suggested based on a report of 2 consanguineous families, one with a single affected child, the second with affected sibs, born to normal parents. We present a family with sibs with CCD born to normal parents, and suggest germ line mosaicism as the more likely mechanism for this occurrence.",M2
7717404,"A gene for cleidocranial dysplasia maps to the short arm of chromosome 6.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant generalized bone dysplasia characterized by mild-to-moderate short stature, clavicular aplasia or hypoplasia, supernumerary and ectopic teeth, delayed eruption of secondary teeth, a characteristic craniofacial appearance, and a variety of other skeletal anomalies. We have performed linkage studies in five families with CCD, with 24 affected and 20 unaffected individuals, using microsatellite markers spanning two candidate regions on chromosomes 8q and 6. The strongest support for linkage was with chromosome 6p microsatellite marker D6S282 with a two-point lod score of 4.84 (theta = .03). Furthermore, the multipoint lod score was 5.70 in the interval between D6S282 and D6S291. These data show that the gene for autosomal dominant CCD is located within a 19-cM interval on the short arm of chromosome 6, between D6S282 and D6S291.",M2
8782054,"Mapping of the gene for cleidocranial dysplasia in the historical Cape Town (Arnold) kindred and evidence for locus homogeneity.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal dominant disorder, features of which include a patient anterior fontanelle, a bulging calvarium, hypoplasia or aplasia of the clavicles, a wide public symphysis, dental anomalies, vertebral malformation, and short stature. The Cape Town kindred which is under our genetic management was originally described more than four decades ago and now consists of more than 1000 people. Following reports of rearrangements on chromosomes 6 and 8 in people with CCD, we have carried out linkage analyses between highly information microsatellite dinucleotide repeat markers in the rearranged regions and the disorder in a branch of this South African CCD kindred, consisting of 38 subjects, 18 of whom are affected. Maximum lod scores (at theta = 0.00) of 7.14 (for marker D6S459), 4.32 (TCTE), 4.99 (D6S452), 5.97 (D6S269), and 3.95 (D6S465) confirm linkage of the disorder to the short arm of chromosome 6. Our data indicate that the CCD gene is located within a minimal region of approximately 10 cM flanked by the marker D6S451 distally and D6S466 proximally. This information is vital towards isolating and characterising the gene for CCD, and is being used to construct a physical map of 6p21.1-6p21.3. More importantly, mapping of the locus in the South African kindred of mixed ancestry, in which the  founder  of the disorder was of Chinese origin, suggests that a single locus is responsible for classic CCD.",M2
8533817,"Genetic mapping of the cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) locus on chromosome band 6p21 to include a microdeletion.Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a generalized skeletal dysplasia with autosomal dominant inheritance. Recently, the CCD disease locus was localized to 23 [Mundlos et al., 1995] and 17 cM regions [Feldman et al., 1995], of chromosome band 6p21 by linkage studies of seven affected families. Of note, the 23 cM region contained a microdeletion detected in one family at D6S459, an interval that was excluded in the 17 cM overlapping region. Here, linkage of CCD to 6p21 was independently confirmed with a maximal two-point LOD score of Z = 5.12 with marker D6S452 at theta = 0.00. Recombinant events in two affected individuals defined a CCD region of 7 cM from D6S465 to D6S282, which overlapped with the CCD region containing the microdeletion but did not overlap with the 17 cM critical region from D6S282 to D6S291. These results suggest the refined localization of the CCD region to 6 cM spanning markers D6S438 to D6S282, thereby reviving the possibility that the CCD gene lies within the microdeletion at D6S459.",M2
7711736,"Genetic mapping of cleidocranial dysplasia and evidence of a microdeletion in one family.Cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disorder of high penetrance affecting skeletal ossification and tooth development. Typically, affected individuals have hypoplastic/aplastic clavicles, patent fontanelles and sutures, supernumerary teeth, and short stature. We have used a candidate locus approach to map the responsible gene in two families with typical features of CCD. Linkage was established between CCD and four loci (D6S426, D6S451, D6S459, TCTE1) that span a region of 10 cM on chromosome 6p. A maximum lod score, Zmax, of 4.1 at a recombination fraction of zero was obtained at D6S451. One highly polymorphic microsatellite from this region (D6S459) showed allelic loss in all affected members of one family with two different sets of primers. The presence of a deletion in this area was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using a probe derived from the amplification product of the D6S459 marker. The data assign a gene for CCD to chromosome 6p21 and suggest that a microdeletion within an area of tight linkage to the CCD-phenotype has been identified.",M2
7601912,"Craniofacial growth in cleidocranial dysplasia--a roentgencephalometric study.The purpose of this study was to analyze craniofacial growth in cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) with emphasis on bone remodeling, mandibular condylar growth, and tooth eruption. Skull radiographs of 22 CCD children followed longitudinally were examined. The span of time investigated varied for each patient, but the period from 5 years to adult age was well covered. Five patients had metallic implants inserted in the jaws; the implants enabled detailed analysis of bone remodeling, jaw rotation, and tooth eruption. In the calvaria, an open anterior fontanelle area persisted in most cases but decreased with age. A frontal sinus failed to develop or was diminutive in all cases but one. In the cranial base, the size increase of the sella turcica was reduced as a result of modest resorption at the floor and the posterior wall; the clivus was flexed in most cases, but the flexion remained stable during the observation period. Growth in maxillary height was severely reduced, primarily because resorptive lowering of the nasal floor was minimal. The amount of bone apposition on the orbital floor and the alveolar process was smaller than expected. Condylar growth direction was vertical giving rise to a forward rotation of the mandible in relation to the anterior cranial base. The expected resorptive remodeling below the mandibular angle and anteriorly on the ramus was negligible. The low maxilla, in combination with a marked forward mandibular rotation in cases with unstable occlusion as a consequence of eruption problems in the permanent dentition, gave rise to a diminished anterior facial height.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
7852545,"Cleidocranial dysplasia: craniofacial morphology in adult patients.The aim of the study was to carry out a detailed quantitative analysis of craniofacial morphology in a relatively large sample (N = 35) of adult patients with cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>) in order to contribute to the understanding of the characteristic craniofacial abnormalities. Roentgencephalometric films in the lateral, frontal, and basal projections were analyzed and mean facial diagrams for the lateral and frontal films were produced based on registration of 216 reference points. In the calvaria an increased width and a relatively more prominent frontal region were found. In the cranial base the most significant findings were reduced width, a cranial displacement of the clivus and sella, and an anteriorly facing foramen magnum. The orbital openings were high and narrow and nearly all patients had hypoplasia or aplasia of the nasal bones. The maxilla and mandible were reduced in height and width and the mandible was anteriorly inclined. It was concluded that all craniofacial regions are affected in CCD. Based on the present and previous studies, it is suggested that the abnormal craniofacial morphology in CCD may be explained by the skeletal dysplasia, combined with early cranial deformation and dysplastic and compensatory skeletal growth. Thus, the findings lead to the comprehension that several primary and secondary causal factors are involved in craniofacial morphogenesis in CCD, and that knowledge of early development is important when etiology and pathogenesis in a syndrome is searched for.",M2
8270769,"Synergistic interactions between two skeletal mutations in mice: individual and combined effects of the semidominants cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>Ccd</e>) and short digits (Dsh).Heterozygotes for cleidocranial dysplasia (Ccd) and short digits (Dsh) were crossed to test whether synergistic interactions occur between different dominant mutations whose individual pleiotropic phenotypic effects exhibit a common feature. These unlinked mutations are homozygous lethal, and they are congenic on the C57BL/10 background. Each mutation caused more than 10 different anomalies and showed variable expressivity. Each mutation produced several malformations that were present in every heterozygote. Seven different synergistic interactions were found, including one that yielded an entirely new abnormality not predicted from any abnormalities found in either of the single heterozygotes. Although synergistic interactions between dominant mutations have not, to our knowledge, been described in humans, these findings in mice increase the probability that they occur in humans. Under certain circumstances in human populations, the segregation of mutations causing synergistic interactions of the type demonstrated might be confused with recessive inheritance. It will be important to learn whether synergistic interactions can occur between other mutations. If they can, it will probably become important to take synergistic interactions into account when estimating the genetic hazards to humans from mutagens. Three antagonistic interactions were also found.",M2
9182764,"Cbfa1, a candidate gene for cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome, is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone development.We have generated Cbfa1-deficient mice. Homozygous mutants die of respiratory failure shortly after birth. Analysis of their skeletons revealed an absence of osteoblasts and bone. Heterozygous mice showed specific skeletal abnormalities that are characteristic of the human heritable skeletal disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia (<e>CCD</e>). These defects are also observed in a mouse Ccd mutant for this disease. The Cbfa1 gene was shown to be deleted in the Ccd mutation. Analysis of embryonic Cbfa1 expression using a lacZ reporter gene revealed strong expression at sites of bone formation prior to the earliest stages of ossification. Thus, the Cbfa1 gene is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and the Cbfa1 heterozygous mouse is a paradigm for a human skeletal disorder.",M2

In some families, the phenotype segregates with deletions resulting in heterozygous loss of CBFA1, a member of the runt family of transcription factors. In other families, insertion, deletion, and missense mutations lead to translational stop codons in the DNA binding domain or in the C-terminal transactivating region. In-frame expansion of a polyalanine stretch segregates in an affected family with brachydactyly and minor clinical findings of CCD. We conclude that CBFA1 mutations cause CCD and that heterozygous loss of function is sufficient to produce the disorder.",M2
