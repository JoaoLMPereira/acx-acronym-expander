20336794,"A single nucleotide polymorphism in the alcohol dehydrogenase 7 gene (alanine to glycine substitution at amino acid 92) is associated with the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a hospital-based study of 1110 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and a control group of 1129 patients to replicate the associations reported by a recent, large European study between 2 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) genes, a substitution in ADH1B at amino acid 48 from arginine to histidine (R48H) (reference SNP number [rs]1229984; guanine to adenine [G--&gt;A]) and a substitution in ADH7 at amino acid 92 from alanine to glycine (A92G) (rs1573496; cytosine to guanine [C--&gt;G]), and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). False-positive report probabilities (FPRPs) also were calculated for significant findings. RESULTS: The ADH7 A92G GG and combined CG + GG genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of SCCHN (GG: adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.82; CG + GG: adjusted OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.94; FPRP, .098) compared with the CC genotype. This association was also evident in subgroups of older patients (aged &gt;57 years), men, former smokers, patients with oral cancer, and patients with N) lymph node status (P &lt; .05 for all); however, such associations were not observed for the ADH1B R48H SNP. CONCLUSIONS: The current results support the ADH7 A92G SNP as a marker for the risk of SCCHN in non-Hispanic white populations.",M1
20204218,"Biocatalysed concurrent production of enantioenriched compounds through parallel interconnected kinetic asymmetric transformations.Parallel interconnected kinetic asymmetric transformations were performed in order to obtain enantioenriched derivatives starting from a set of racemic or prochiral compounds. Thus, in a one-pot reaction using two redox biocatalysts (a BVMO and an <e>ADH</e>) and a catalytic amount of cofactor that acts as a mediator, enantioenriched ketones, sulfoxides, and sec-alcohols were concurrently obtained in a strict parallel way, minimising the quantity of reagents employed. By selecting the appropriate biocatalysts, this methodology represents a potential tool for performing stereodivergent transformations.",M1
20193044,"Inhibition kinetics of catabolic dehydrogenases by elevated moieties of ATP and ADP--implication for a new regulation mechanism in Lactococcus lactis.ATP and ADP inhibit, in varying degrees, several dehydrogenases of the central carbon metabolism of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 19435 in vitro, i.e. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>). Here we demonstrate mixed inhibition for GAPDH and competitive inhibition for LDH and ADH by adenine nucleotides in single inhibition studies. The nonlinear negative co-operativity was best modelled with Hill-type kinetics, showing greater flexibility than the usual parabolic inhibition equation. Because these natural inhibitors are present simultaneously in the cytoplasm, multiple inhibition kinetics was determined for each dehydrogenase. For ADH and LDH, the inhibitor combinations ATP plus NAD and ADP plus NAD are indifferent to each other. Model discrimination suggested that the weak allosteric inhibition of GAPDH had no relevance when multiple inhibitors are present. Interestingly, with ADH and GAPDH the combination of ATP and ADP exhibits lower dissociation constants than with either inhibitor alone. Moreover, the concerted inhibition of ADH and GAPDH, but not of LDH, shows synergy between the two nucleotides. Similar kinetics, but without synergies, were found for horse liver and yeast ADHs, indicating that dehydrogenases can be modulated by these nucleotides in a nonlinear manner in many organisms. The action of an elevated pool of ATP and ADP may effectively inactivate lactococcal ADH, but not GAPDH and LDH, providing leverage for the observed metabolic shift to homolactic acid formation in lactococcal resting cells on maltose. Therefore, we interpret these results as a regulation mechanism contributing to readjusting the flux of ATP production in L. lactis.",M1
20188915,"Metal-protein binding losses in proteomic studies by PAGE-LA-ICP-MS.Some experiments to study the influence of electrophoresis conditions and subsequent LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) determination of two metal-binding proteins with different metal-protein affinities (superoxide dismutase, containing Cu and Zn, and alcohol dehydrogenase, containing Zn) are performed. In metal-binding proteins with weak metal-protein affinities, metal losses can happen during electrophoretic separation. It has been demonstrated that the detection of these metals bound to the proteins depends, not only on the nature of the electrophoretic process (naturing or non-denaturing) and post-separation gel treatment, but also on the trailing ion chosen and current applied in the electrophoretic method used. Non-denaturing methods are preferred to denaturing ones in the case of alcohol dehydrogenase being BN-PAGE (Blue Native-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) with the use of Tricine as trailing ion the most recommended method. The concentration obtained for Zn in <e>ADH</e> applying BN-PAGE-LA-ICP-MS was 2.6+/-0.30 mg g(-1) very close to the one obtained for ADH solution by ICP-MS (3+/-0.23 mg g(1)). For superoxide dismutase either denaturing or non-denaturing electrophoresis conditions can be used, but a denaturing method based on the use of Tricine as trailing ion is recommended to preserve metals-protein binding when the use of non-denaturing conditions must be avoided. The found concentration for Cu and Zn in SOD after applying SDS-Tris-Tricine-PAGE-LA-ICP-MS was 2.5+/-0.33 and 2.4+/-0.37 mg g(-1) respectively, more or less close (especially for Cu) to the one obtained in SOD solution by ICP-MS (3+/-0.21 and 3.7+/-0.32 mg g(-1) for Cu and Zn). We observe that as higher current is applied the possibility of metal-protein binding losses is higher. In all cases staining of the gel prior to LA-ICP-MS is not recommended.",M1
20158305,"Associations between <e>ADH</e> gene variants and alcohol phenotypes in Dutch adults.Recently, Macgregor et al. (2009) demonstrated significant associations of ADH polymorphisms with reactions to alcohol and alcohol consumption measures in an Australian sample. The aim of the present study was to replicate these findings in a Dutch sample. Survey data on alcohol phenotypes came from 1,754 unrelated individuals registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. SNPs in the ADH gene cluster located on chromosome 4q (n = 491) were subdivided in seven gene sets: ADH5, ADH4, ADH6, ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH7. Within these sets associations of SNPs with alcohol consumption measures, age at onset variables, reactions to alcohol and problem drinking liability were examined. Of the original 38 SNPs studied by Macgregor et al. (2009), six SNPs were not available in our dataset, because one of them had a minor allele frequency &lt; .01 (rs1229984) and five could not be imputed. The remaining SNP associations with alcohol phenotypes as identified by Macgregor et al. (2009) were not replicated in the Dutch sample, after correcting for multiple genotype and phenotype testing. Significant associations were found however, for reactions to alcohol with a SNP in ADH5 (rs6827292, p = .001) and a SNP just upstream of ADH5 (rs6819724, p = .0007) that is in strong LD with rs6827292. Furthermore, an association between age at onset of regular alcohol use and a SNP just upstream of ADH7 (rs2654849, p = .003) was observed. No significant associations were found for alcohol consumption and problem drinking liability. Although these findings do not replicate the earlier findings at the SNP level, the results confirm the role of the ADH gene cluster in alcohol phenotypes.",M1
20148520,"The membrane-bound quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5 carries a [2Fe-2S] cluster.Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus stands out among the acetic acid bacteria as it fixes dinitrogen and is a true endophyte. It has a set of constitutive enzymes to oxidize ethanol and acetaldehyde which is upregulated during N(2)-dependent growth. The membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) is a heterodimer (subunit I approximately 72 kDa, subunit II approximately 44 kDa) and constitutes an important component of this organism. ADH of Ga. diazotrophicus is a typical quinohemoprotein with one pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and four c-type cytochromes. For the first time, a [2Fe-2S] cluster has been identified by EPR spectroscopy in this type of enzyme. This finding is supported by quantitative chemical analysis, revealing 5.90 +/- 0.15 Fe and 2.06 +/- 0.10 acid-labile sulfurs per ADH heterodimer. The X-band EPR spectrum of ADH (as isolated in the presence of dioxygen, 20 K) showed three broad resonances at g 2.007, 1.941, and 1.920 (g(av) 1.956), as well as an intense narrow line centered at g = 2.0034. The latter signal, which was still detected at 100 K, was attributed to the PQQ semiquinone radical (PQQ(sq)). The broad resonances observed at lower temperature were assigned to the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the one-electron reduced state. The oxidation-reduction potentials E(m) (pH 6.0 vs SHE) of the four c-type cytochromes were estimated to E(m1) = -64 (+/-2) mV, E(m2) = -8 (+/-2) mV, E(m3) = +185 (+/-15) mV, and E(m4) = +210 (+/-10) mV (spectroelectrochemistry), E(mFeS) = -250 (+/-5) mV for the [2Fe-2S] cluster, and E(mPQQ) = -210 (+/-5) mV for the PQQ/PQQH(2) couple (EPR spectroscopy). We propose a model for the membrane-bound ADH of Ga. diazotrophicus showing hypothetical intra- and intermolecular electron pathways. Subunit I binds the PQQ cofactor, the [2Fe-2S] cluster, and one c-type cytochrome. Subunit II harbors three c-type cytochromes, thus providing an efficient electron transfer route to quinones located in the cytoplasmic membrane.",M1
20141418,"Oikopleura dioica alcohol dehydrogenase class 3 provides new insights into the evolution of retinoic acid synthesis in chordates.Enzymes that synthesize retinoic acid (RA) constitute the first level of regulation of RA action. In vertebrates, enzymes of the medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (MDR-<e>Adh</e>) family catalyze the first step of the RA synthetic pathway by oxidizing retinol. Among MDR-Adh enzymes, Adh3 is the only member present in non-vertebrates, and whether Adh3 is actually involved in RA biosynthesis remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the MDR-Adh family in Oikopleura dioica, a urochordate representing the sister group to vertebrates. Oikopleura is of special interest because it has lost the classical RA role in development, which relaxed evolutionary constraints to preserve the RA-genetic machinery, leading to the loss of RA-system components. The hypothesis that Adh3 plays a role in RA synthesis predicts that the relaxation of selection in Oikopleura should have led to the loss of Adh3, or changes in residues related to retinol oxidation. The hypothesis also predicts changes in the expression pattern of Oikopleura Adh3 compared to other chordates that preserved RA-signaling. Our results, however, revealed the presence of a highly conserved Adh3 gene in Oikopleura, with no significant changes in functional residues. Our results also revealed that the Oikopleura Adh3 expression remains unchanged in comparison to other non-vertebrate chordates, restricted to specific compartments of the digestive system. Because Adh3 has been highly conserved in an animal that has dismantled the RA system, we conclude that Adh3 preservation is not due to a conserved role in RA synthesis. Thereby, if Adh3 plays a role in RA synthesis in vertebrates, it might be a lineage-specific neofunctionalization.",M1
20116195,"The role of ethanol metabolism in development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in the rat.The importance of ethanol metabolism in the development of alcoholic liver disease remains controversial. The present study examined the effects of selective inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 compared with the inhibition of overall ethanol metabolism on the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed via total enteral nutrition for 45 days with or without 10-12g/kg/d ethanol. Some groups were given 200mg/kg/d of the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide (DAS). Other groups were treated with 164mg/kg/d of the alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and dosed at 2-3g/kg/d ethanol to maintain similar average urine ethanol concentrations. Liver pathology scores and levels of apoptosis were elevated by ethanol (P&lt;.05) but did not differ significantly on cotreatment with DAS or 4-MP. However, liver triglycerides were lower when ethanol-fed rats were treated with DAS or 4-MP (P&lt;.05). Serum alanine aminotransferase values were significantly lower in ethanol-fed 4-MP-treated rats indicating reduced necrosis. Hepatic oxidative stress and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker tribbles-related protein 3 were increased after ethanol (P&lt;.05); further increased by DAS but partly attenuated by 4-MP. Both DAS and 4-MP reversed ethanol increases in the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the chemokine CXCL-2 (P&lt;.05). However, neither inhibitors prevented ethanol suppression of interleukins IL-4 or IL-12. Moreover, neither inhibitors prevented ethanol increases in tumor growth factor-beta mRNA. Ethanol and DAS additively induced hepatic hyperplasia (P&lt;.05). These data suggest that a significant proportion of hepatic injury after ethanol exposure is independent of alcohol metabolism. Ethanol metabolism by CYP2E1 may be linked in part to triglyceride accumulation, to induction of TNF-alpha, and to chemokine production. Ethanol metabolism by ADH may be linked in part to oxidative and ER stress and necrotic injury.",M1
20090911,"Alcohol dehydrogenase accentuates ethanol-induced myocardial dysfunction and mitochondrial damage in mice: role of mitochondrial death pathway.OBJECTIVES: Binge drinking and alcohol toxicity are often associated with myocardial dysfunction possibly due to accumulation of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde although the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study was designed to examine the impact of accelerated ethanol metabolism on myocardial contractility, mitochondrial function and apoptosis using a murine model of cardiac-specific overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>). METHODS: ADH and wild-type FVB mice were acutely challenged with ethanol (3 g/kg/d, i.p.) for 3 days. Myocardial contractility, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis (death receptor and mitochondrial pathways) were examined. RESULTS: Ethanol led to reduced cardiac contractility, enlarged cardiomyocyte, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, the effects of which were exaggerated by ADH transgene. In particular, ADH exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction manifested as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of mitochondrial O(2) (*-). Myocardium from ethanol-treated mice displayed enhanced Bax, Caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 expression, the effect of which with the exception of Caspase-3 was augmented by ADH. ADH accentuated ethanol-induced increase in the mitochondrial death domain components pro-caspase-9 and cytochrome C in the cytoplasm. Neither ethanol nor ADH affected the expression of ANP, total pro-caspase-9, cytosolic and total pro-caspase-8, TNF-alpha, Fas receptor, Fas L and cytosolic AIF. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced acetaldehyde production through ADH overexpression following acute ethanol exposure exacerbated ethanol-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction, cardiomyocyte enlargement, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, indicating a pivotal role of ADH in ethanol-induced cardiac dysfunction possibly through mitochondrial death pathway of apoptosis.",M1
20078057,"Pharmacophore mapping via cross-relaxation during adiabatic fast passage.A novel NMR method is demonstrated for the investigation of protein ligand interactions. In this approach an adiabatic fast passage pulse, i.e. a long, weak pulse with a linear frequency sweep, is used to probe (1)H-(1)H NOEs. During the adiabatic fast passage the effective rotating-frame NOE is a weighted average of transverse and longitudinal cross-relaxation contributions that can be tuned by pulse power and frequency sweep rate. It is demonstrated that the occurrence of spin diffusion processes leads to sizable deviations from the theoretical relationship between effective relaxation rate and effective tilt angle in the spin lock frame and can be used to probe protein-ligand binding. This methodology comprises high sensitivity and ease of implementation. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated with two protein complexes, vanillic acid bound to the quail lipocalin Q83 and NAD(+) and AMP binding to alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>).",M1
20041794,"Effects of a preparation of combined glutathione-enriched yeast and rice embryo/soybean extracts on ethanol hangover.The effects of a preparation of combined glutathione-enriched yeast (GEY) and rice embryo/soybean (RES) extracts (20:1), GEY/RES, on experimentally induced ethanol hangover were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. To evaluate the preventive effects on hangover, rats were orally administered GEY/RES (50/2.5, 100/5, or 200/10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At 30 minutes after the final treatment, they were challenged with 3 mL/kg ethanol (15 mL of 20% in water/kg). The blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde were analyzed up to 7 hours postchallenge. Hepatic mRNA expression levels of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), cytochrome P450 type 2E1 (CYP2E1), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additional rats were challenged with ethanol and, 60 minutes later, administered GEY/RES to evaluate alcohol clearance. Pretreatment with GEY/RES for 2 weeks reduced the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde in a dose-dependent manner, lowering by 29.5% and 54.6% at the highest dose (200/10 mg/kg), respectively. The expressions of mRNAs for ADH and ALDH, the major alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, were markedly increased in the livers of rats administered GEY/RES for 2 weeks, whereas CYP2E1 mRNA was suppressed. Postchallenge treatment with GEY/RES enhanced the alcohol clearance rate by lowering blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde by 24% and 26.6%, respectively, for the highest dose group. GEY/RES remarkably eliminated 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate radical and FeCl(3)-mediated lipid peroxidation in vitro and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation following ethanol administration in vivo. Therefore, it is suggested that GEY/RES reduces the blood concentrations of alcohol and acetaldehyde not only by modulating alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, but also by exerting its antioxidant activity, and that GEY/RES could be a promising candidate for improvements of alcoholic hangover.",M1
20026516,"Ranitidine as an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor in acute methanol toxicity in rats.Methanol poisoning is a hazardous intoxication characterized by visual impairment and formic acidemia. The therapy for methanol poisoning is alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) inhibitors to prevent formate accumulation. Ranitidine has been considered to be an inhibitor of both gastric alcohol and hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. This study aimed at testing ranitidine as an antidote for methanol acute toxicity and comparing it with ethanol and 4-methyl pyrazole (4-MP). This study was conducted on 48 Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into 6 groups, with 8 rats in each group (one negative control group [C1], two positive control groups [C2, C3] and three test groups [1, 2 and 3]). C2, C3 and all test groups were exposed to nitrous oxide by inhalation, then, C3 group was given methanol (3 g/kg orally). The three test groups 1, 2 and 3 were given ethanol (0.5 g/kg orally), 4-MP (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and ranitidine (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally), respectively, 4 hours after giving methanol. Rats were sacrificed and heparinized, cardiac blood samples were collected for blood pH and bicarbonate. Non-heparinized blood samples were collected for formate levels by high performance liquid chromatography. Eye balls were enucleated for histological examination of the retina. Ranitidine corrected metabolic acidosis (p = .025), decreased formate levels (p = .014) and improved the histological findings in the retina induced by acute methanol toxicity.",M1
19966063,"Experimentally increased codon bias in the Drosophila <e>Adh</e> gene leads to an increase in larval, but not adult, alcohol dehydrogenase activity.Although most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon, the synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. This phenomenon is known as codon bias and appears to be a universal feature of genomes. The translational selection hypothesis posits that the use of optimal codons, which match the most abundant species of isoaccepting tRNAs, results in increased translational efficiency and accuracy. Previous work demonstrated that the experimental reduction of codon bias in the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene led to a significant decrease in ADH protein expression. In this study we performed the converse experiment: we replaced seven suboptimal leucine codons that occur naturally in the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene with the optimal codon. We then compared the in vivo ADH activities imparted by the wild-type and mutant alleles. The introduction of optimal leucine codons led to an increase in ADH activity in third-instar larvae. In adult flies, however, the introduction of optimal codons led to a decrease in ADH activity. There is no evidence that other selectively constrained features of the Adh gene, or its rate of transcription, were altered by the synonymous replacements. These results are consistent with translational selection for codon bias being stronger in the larval stage and suggest that there may be a selective conflict over optimal codon usage between different developmental stages.",M1
19963209,"Chaperone-like activity of alpha-cyclodextrin via hydrophobic nanocavity to protect native structure of <e>ADH</e>.The chaperone action of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CyD), based on providing beneficial microenvironment of hydrophobic nanocavity to form molecular complex with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was examined by experimental and computational techniques. The results of UV-vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the chaperone-like activity of alpha-CyD depends on molecular complex formation between alpha-CyD and ADH, which caused to decrease the amount and size of polymerized molecules. Computational calculations of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and blind docking (BD) demonstrated that alpha-CyD acts as an artificial chaperone because of its high affinity to the region of ADH's two chains interface. The hydrophobic nanocavity of alpha-CyD has the ability to form inclusion complex due to the presence of phenyl ring of aromatic phenylalanine (Phe) residue in the dimeric intersection area. Delocalization of ADH subunits, which causes the exposure of Phe110, takes part in the enzyme polymerization and has proven to be beneficial for aggregation inhibition and solubility enhancement within the host alpha-CyD-nanocavity.",M1
19954758,"Opioid peptides derived from food proteins suppress aggregation and promote reactivation of partly unfolded stressed proteins.A new view of the opioid peptides is presented. The potential of small peptides derived from precursor food proteins, to bind to partly unfolded stressed proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation and inactivation has been demonstrated in various in vitro test systems: dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin (LA), heat-induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), and aggregation and inactivation of bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the process of its refolding after removal of stress conditions. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), turbidimetry, fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements protective effects of the synthetic opioid peptides: exorphin C from wheat gluten (Tyr-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu), rubiscolin-5 from spinach ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu), and hemorphin-6 from bovine hemoglobin (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg) have been revealed. We have demonstrated the concentration-dependent suppression of light scattering intensity of aggregates of LA and ADH in the presence of the peptides, the population of nanoparticles with higher hydrodynamic radii being shifted to the lower ones, accompanied by an increase in the lag period of aggregation. The presence of the peptides in the refolding solution was shown to assist reactivation of CA and enhance the yield of the CA soluble protein. The results suggest that bioactive food protein fragments may be regarded as exogenous supplements to the endogenous defense mechanisms of the human organism under stress conditions.",M1
19932956,"Purification and characterization of an alcohol dehydrogenase with an unusual specificity towards glycerol from Thermus thermophilus.The purification and characterization of an NAD(+)-dependent and zinc containing alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) from Thermus thermophilus (TTHADH) is described. The enzyme could be purified with 25-fold purification and 68% yield using a single chromatographic step. The enzyme was found to be a tetramer (170 kDa) of identical subunits. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was 8.8 and the temperature optimum was found to be 80 degrees C. Thermal denaturation curves were determined by monitoring the CD values at 222 nm and the T(m) was found to be 89 degrees C. The enzyme showed much higher activity towards glycerol as compared to short chain primary and secondary alcohols. This thermostable enzyme was also highly stereospecific in oxidation of glycerol and converted glycerol into d-glyceraldehyde. The enzyme which converts glycerol into a chiral molecule like d-glyceraldehyde opens up several synthetic opportunities.",M1
19924753,"Observation of protein domain motions by neutron spectroscopy.High-resolution inelastic neutron scattering, which is available with neutron spin-echo spectroscopy (NSE) is introduced as a tool for the analysis of biomolecule flexibility. Coherent scattering in a range where it is sensitive to length scales of nanometers and covering a time range from picoseconds to several 100 ns makes the motion of larger subdomains within proteins visible. We show that and how the internal domain motion within a protein in solution can be measured. Comparison with displacement patterns from normal mode analysis provides further insight into the nature of the geometry of the motions that lead to the observed dynamic signature. The NSE experiment on alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) is used as example to illustrate the general principles of the method.",M1
19902949,"Finding the joker among the maize endogenous reference genes for genetically modified organism (GMO) detection.The comparison of five real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods targeted at maize ( Zea mays ) endogenous sequences is reported. PCR targets were the alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>adh</e>) gene for three methods and high-mobility group (hmg) gene for the other two. The five real-time PCR methods have been checked under repeatability conditions at several dilution levels on both pooled DNA template from several genetically modified (GM) maize certified reference materials (CRMs) and single CRM DNA extracts. Slopes and R(2) coefficients of all of the curves obtained from the adopted regression model were compared within the same method and among all of the five methods, and the limit of detection and limit of quantitation were analyzed for each PCR system. Furthermore, method equivalency was evaluated on the basis of the ability to estimate the target haploid genome copy number at each concentration level. Results indicated that, among the five methods tested, one of the hmg-targeted PCR systems can be considered equivalent to the others but shows the best regression parameters and a higher repeteability along the dilution range. Thereby, it is proposed as a valid module to be coupled to different event-specific real-time PCR for maize genetically modified organism (GMO) quantitation. The resulting practicability improvement on the analytical control of GMOs is discussed.",M1
19874713,"Isolation and characterization of a novel short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase gene from Panax ginseng.The cDNA of alcohol dehydrogenase (PgADH) was isolated and characterized from the leaf of Panax ginseng. The cDNA had an open reading frame of 801 bp and a deduced amino acid sequence of 266 residues. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein is approximately 29 kDa with a predicated isoelectric point of 6.84. Homology analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid of PgADH shares a high degree of homology with the short-chain <e>ADH</e> proteins of other plants. Genomic DNA hybridization analysis indicated that PgADH represents a multi-gene family. The expression of PgADH under various environmental stresses was analyzed at different time points using real-time PCR. ABA, SA and especially JA (80-fold) significantly induced PgADH expression within 24 h of treatment. The positive responses of PgADH to abiotic stimuli suggest that ginseng ADH may protect against hormone-related environmental stresses.",M1
19861527,"Impact of multiple alcohol dehydrogenase gene polymorphisms on risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in a Japanese population.Alcohol intake is positively associated with the risk of upper aerodigestive tract (UAT) cancer. The genes that encode alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, primarily alcohol dehydrogenases (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), are polymorphic. In Caucasians, significant associations between polymorphisms in ADH1B (rs1229984) and ADH1C (rs698 and rs1693482), and UAT cancer have been observed, despite strong linkage disequilibrium among them. Moreover, UAT cancer was significantly associated with rs1573496 in ADH7, and not with rs1984362 in ADH4. However, little evidence is available concerning ADH4 or ADH7 polymorphisms in Asian populations. We conducted a matched case-control study to clarify the role of ADH polymorphisms in a Japanese population. Cases and controls were 585 patients with UAT cancer and 1,170 noncancer outpatients. Genotyping for ADHs and ALDH2 was done using TaqMan assays. Associations between polymorphisms and UAT cancer were assessed by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, smoking, drinking, and ALDH2. Adjusted odds ratios were significant for rs4148887 and rs3805322 in ADH4, rs1229984 in ADH1B, rs698 and rs1693482 in ADH1C, and rs284787, rs1154460, and rs3737482 in ADH7. We also observed that ADH7 rs3737482 and ADH4 rs4148887 had independently and statistically significant effects on UAT cancer. The magnitude of effect of these ADH polymorphisms was greater in subjects who were heavy drinkers, heavy smokers, and had esophageal cancer. These findings show that multiple ADH gene polymorphisms were associated with UAT cancer in this Japanese population. Further studies in various ethnicities are required.",M1
19834749,"Evaluation of the impact of functional diversification on Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes.The plant alcohol dehydrogenases (<e>ADHs</e>) have been intensively studied in the last years in terms of phylogeny and they have been widely used as a molecular marker. However, almost no information about their three-dimensional structure is available. Several studies point to functional diversification of the ADH, with evidence of its importance, in different organisms, in the ethanol, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and bile acid metabolism. Computational results demonstrated that in plants these enzymes are submitted to a functional diversification process, which is reinforced by experimental studies indicating distinct enzymatic functions as well as recruitment of specific genes in different tissues. The main objective of this article is to establish a correlation between the functional diversification occurring in the plant alcohol dehydrogenase family and the three-dimensional structures predicted for 17 ADH belonging to Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae botanical families. Volume, molecular weight and surface areas are not markedly different among them. Important electrostatic and pI differences were observed with the residues responsible for some of them identified, corroborating the function diversification hypothesis. These data furnish important background information for future specific structure-function and evolutionary investigations.",M1
19824993,"Structural features of the NAD-dependent in situ retinoic acid supply system in esophageal mucosa.BACKGROUND: We previously reported that an NAD-dependent in situ retinoic acid supply system, which comprises some isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and provides retinoic acid from retinol via a 2-step oxidation process, exists in the rat esophagus. Herein, their isoforms responsible for the pathway and its localization in the rat esophagus was examined. METHODS: The expressions of mRNAs of various isoforms of ADH and ALDH were examined in the fraction mainly comprising mucosal layer of the rat esophagus by RT-PCR. Expression levels of Class IV ADH and ALDH 1A1 were compared between the fractions and that mainly comprising muscle layer of the rat esophagus by quantitative PCR. The catalytic activities producing retinoic acid from retinal were compared between the 2 fractions and its optimum pH was also determined. RESULTS: Classes I, III, and IV ADHs and ALDHs 1A1 and 3A1 were predominant isoforms in the rat esophageal mucosa. The expression levels of mRNA of Class IV ADH and ALDH 3A1 were significantly higher in the mucosal than in the muscle layer. Consistently, the catalytic activities producing retinoic acid from retinal were significantly higher in the former than the latter. The optimum pH of the process was 9.0. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the affinities for retinol and retinal of ADHs and ALDHs expressed in the rat esophagus, the NAD-dependent in situ retinoic acid supply system in the rat esophagus is thought to comprise Class IV ADH and ALDH 1A1. In the rat esophagus, the system exists predominantly in the mucosal layer.",M1
19811926,"Functional characterization of three water deficit stress-induced genes in tobacco and Arabidopsis: an approach based on gene down regulation.Functional characterization of water deficit stress responsive genes is important to understand their role in stress tolerance. RNAi-based silencing of gene of interest and studying the stress response of knockdown plants under stress can be one of the potential options for assessing functional significance of these genes. Several genes showing higher transcript expression under water deficit stress were cloned earlier from a stress adapted crop species, groundnut. In this study, a few selected gene homologs have been characterized in Nicotiana tabacum and Arabidopsis. Using post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) based RNAi approach we developed N. tabacum knockdown lines for three of the genes namely alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), trans caffeoyl coA-3-O-methyl transferase (CcoAOMT) and flavonol-3-O-glucosyl transferase (F3OGT). By quantitative RT-PCR we demonstrated that the RNAi lines showed significant reduction in target gene transcripts. We followed a stress imposition protocol that allows the plants to experience initial gradual acclimation stress and subsequently severe stress for a definite period. The RNAi knockdown lines generated against ADH and F3OGT, when subjected to water deficit stress showed susceptible symptoms signifying the relevance of these genes under stress. Knockdown of CcoAOMT showed higher chlorophyll degradation and less cell viability upon stress compared to control plants. Further, the Arabidopsis mutant lines clearly showed susceptibility to salinity and water deficit stresses validating relevance of these three genes under abiotic stresses.",M1
19778255,"Induction of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and heat shock protein expression by ethanol and modulation by fenugreek seed polyphenols in Chang liver cells.The present study investigated the effect of fenugreek seed polyphenolic extract (FPEt) on ethanol-induced protein expression in Chang liver cells. Cells were incubated with either 30 mM EtOH alone or together in the presence of FPEt for 24 h. Cells were harvested and assessed for expression of alcohol metabolizing enzymes-alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>(2) isoform), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH(2) isoform), cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1), the electron transport component (cytochrome-c), and the heat shock proteins. The expression of ADH(2), ALDH(2), and CYP2E1 were upregulated, whereas the expression of cytochrome-c was downregulated in the ethanol-treated cells. The expression of cellular heat shock proteins-HSP70, HSC70, HSC92, and mitochondrial protein mtHSP70 were induced in ethanol-treated Chang liver cells. FPEt modulated the protein expression changes induced by ethanol and had no effect when incubated with normal Chang liver cells. FPEt might exert cytoprotective action on ethanol-induced liver cell damage, possibly by enhancing cellular redox status.",M1
19710201,"Mechanism of protection against alcoholism by an alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism: development of an animal model.Humans who carry a point mutation in the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase-1B (ADH1B*2; Arg47His) are markedly protected against alcoholism. Although this mutation results in a 100-fold increase in enzyme activity, it has not been reported to cause higher levels of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol known to deter alcohol intake. Hence, the mechanism by which this mutation confers protection against alcoholism is unknown. To study this protective effect, the wild-type rat cDNA encoding rADH-47Arg was mutated to encode rADH-47His, mimicking the human mutation. The mutated cDNA was incorporated into an adenoviral vector and administered to genetically selected alcohol-preferring rats. The V(max) of rADH-47His was 6-fold higher (P&lt;0.001) than that of the wild-type rADH-47Arg. Animals transduced with rAdh-47His showed a 90% (P&lt;0.01) increase in liver <e>ADH</e> activity and a 50% reduction (P&lt;0.001) in voluntary ethanol intake. In animals transduced with rAdh-47His, administration of ethanol (1g/kg) produced a short-lived increase of arterial blood acetaldehyde concentration to levels that were 3.5- to 5-fold greater than those in animals transduced with the wild-type rAdh-47Arg vector or with a noncoding vector. This brief increase (burst) in arterial acetaldehyde concentration after ethanol ingestion may constitute the mechanism by which humans carrying the ADH1B*2 allele are protected against alcoholism.",M1
19687126,"A non-synonymous variant in ADH1B is strongly associated with prenatal alcohol use in a European sample of pregnant women.Pregnant women are advised to abstain from alcohol despite insufficient evidence on the fetal consequences of moderate prenatal alcohol use. Mendelian randomization could help distinguish causal effects from artifacts due to residual confounding and measurement errors; however, polymorphisms reliably associated with alcohol phenotypes are needed. We aimed to test whether alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) gene variants were associated with alcohol use before and during pregnancy. Ten variants in four ADH genes were genotyped in women from South-West England. Phenotypes of interest were quantity and patterns of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, including quitting alcohol following pregnancy recognition. We tested single-locus associations between genotypes and phenotypes with regression models. We used Bayesian models (multi-locus) to take account of linkage disequilibrium and reanalyzed the data with further exclusions following two conservative definitions of 'white ethnicity' based on the woman's reported parental ethnicity or a set of ancestry-informative genetic markers. Single-locus analyses on 7410 women of white/European background showed strong associations for rs1229984 (ADH1B). Rare allele carriers consumed less alcohol before pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.86, P = 0.001], were less likely to have 'binged' during pregnancy (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.78, P = 0.0009), and more likely to have abstained in the first trimester of gestation (adjusted OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.12-1.80, P = 0.004). Multi-locus models confirmed these results. Sensitivity analyses did not suggest the presence of residual population stratification. We confirmed the established association of rs1229984 with reduced alcohol consumption over the life-course, contributing new evidence of an effect before and during pregnancy.",M1
19618839,"Effects of polymorphisms in untranslated regions of the class I alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) genes on alcohol metabolism in Japanese subjects and transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells.Human class I ADH is a dimmer formed by the random association of three types of subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) encoded by ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C, respectively. Different kinetic properties were reported due to polymorphisms of ADH1B Arg47His and ADHIC Ile349Val. Besides these polymorphisms in the coding region, various mutations in the promoter region and 3' untranslated (UTR) region, which possibly affect expression and degradation rate, were recently reported. In this study, to asses the involvement of each genotype in alcohol metabolism in humans, our previously collected data set of blood EtOH and AcH changes were reanalyzed with regard to the ALDH2 Glu487Lys genotype. The effects of genotypes and haplo-types on transcriptional activity were also examined by a luciferase reporter assay by cloning the promoter region and 3' UTR corresponding to each polymorphism and transfecting into HepG2 cells. Among the nine polymorphisms, including ADH1B Arg47His and ADH1C Ile349Val, blood EtOH levels were significantly affected by polymorphisms ADH1B -451G&gt;T, ADH1B +52A&gt;G, ADH1B +531G&gt;A, ADH1B +1176AG&gt;del. and ADH1A -55C&gt;T in ALDH2 Glu/Glu subjects. In the ALDH2 Glu/Lys genotype background, only ADH1C -254G&gt;C and ADH1B His47Arg showed significant effects on blood EtOH. These five loci (and the two loci which had significant effect on blood EtOH in ALDH2 Glu/Glu and Glu/Lys subjects) also showed strong linkage disequilibrium. In comparison to the in vivo study on alcohol metabolism, significantly higher transcriptional activities in ADH1B -451T (rather than C) promoter and ADH1C-254 G (rather than C) promoter were observed in a luciferase assay in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, polymorphisms in the untranslated regions of ADH class I genes were demonstrated to clearly affect individual differences in alcohol metabolism. Especially, ADH1B -451G&gt;T, ADH1C-254G&gt;C polymorphisms were suggested to have functional significance with regard to transcriptional activity to the linkage equilibrium of polymorphisms ADH1B His47Arg and ADH1C Ile349Val.",M1
19609521,"Engineering the isobutanol biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli by comparison of three aldehyde reductase/alcohol dehydrogenase genes.Biofuels synthesized from renewable resources are of increasing interest because of global energy and environmental problems. We have previously demonstrated production of higher alcohols from Escherichia coli using a 2-keto acid-based pathway. Here, we have compared the effect of various alcohol dehydrogenases (<e>ADH</e>) for the last step of the isobutanol production. E. coli has the yqhD gene which encodes a broad-range ADH. Isobutanol production significantly decreased with the deletion of yqhD, suggesting that the yqhD gene on the genome contributed to isobutanol production. The adh genes of two bacteria and one yeast were also compared in E. coli harboring the isobutanol synthesis pathway. Overexpression of yqhD or adhA in E. coli showed better production than ADH2, a result confirmed by activity measurements with isobutyraldehyde.",M1
19588068,"Role of tryptophan 95 in substrate specificity and structural stability of Sulfolobus solfataricus alcohol dehydrogenase.A mutant of the thermostable NAD(+)-dependent (S)-stereospecific alcohol dehydrogenase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsADH) which has a single substitution, Trp95Leu, located at the substrate binding pocket, was fully characterized to ascertain the role of Trp95 in discriminating between chiral secondary alcohols suggested by the wild-type SsADH crystallographic structure. The Trp95Leu mutant displays no apparent activity with short-chain primary and secondary alcohols and poor activity with aromatic substrates and coenzyme. Moreover, the Trp --&gt; Leu substitution affects the structural stability of the archaeal <e>ADH</e>, decreasing its thermal stability without relevant changes in secondary structure. The double mutant Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr was also purified to assist in crystallographic analysis. This mutant exhibits higher activity but decreased affinity toward aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes as well as NAD(+) and NADH compared to the wild-type enzyme. The crystal structure of the Trp95Leu/Asn249Tyr mutant apo form, determined at 2.0 A resolution, reveals a large local rearrangement of the substrate site with dramatic consequences. The Leu95 side-chain conformation points away from the catalytic metal center and the widening of the substrate site is partially counteracted by a concomitant change of Trp117 side chain conformation. Structural changes at the active site are consistent with the reduced activity on substrates and decreased coenzyme binding.",M1
19586851,"[Molecular cloning and expression of alcohol dehydrogenase gene of Phanerochaete chrysosporium]When Phanerochaete chrysosporium is grown under oxygen-limited condition, ethanol is one of the important metabolites. In order to understand the metabolic mechanism of P. chrysosporium grown under oxygen-limited condition, a cDNA sequence (1 071 bp) designated  PCAdh1  encoding an alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) was cloned from the filamentous white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium. PCAdh1 gene encodes a protein of 356 amino acid residues. Although the catalytic domain and coenzyme-binding domain were highly conserved, the protein sequence of PCAdh1 showed a low level of similarity to other known ADH. The recombinant PCAdh1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and its enzyme activity was detected. The protein was purified and used to prepare antibody. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated that the expression level of PCAdh1 in P. chrysosporium remained stable despite the lowered oxygen content, indicating that the gene expression is constitutive. But with the reduction of oxygen content, the overall activity of ADH from the crude mycelia proteins was increased during the growing periods, implying that the expression of other Adh genes in P. chrysosporium is inductive.",M1

The effect of immobilization on ADH activity, optimum temperature and pH, thermal, pH and operational stability, reusability of immobilized ADH, and bioreduction of ethyl 3-oxobutyrate (EOB) to ethyl(S)-3-hydroxybutyrate ((S)-EHB) by the immobilized ADH were investigated. The results show the immobilized ADH retained higher activity over wider ranges of pH and temperature than those of the free. The optimum temperature and pH were 7.5 and 35 degrees C, respectively, and 58% of the original activity was retented after incubation at 35 degrees C for 32 h. More importantly, in bioreduction of EOB mediated by immobilized ADH, the conversion of substrate and enantiomeric excess (ee) of product reached 88% and 99.2%, respectively, within 2 h and retained about 42% of the initial activity after eight cycles.",M1
19565194,"Superabsorbed alcohol dehydrogenase--a new catalyst for asymmetric reductions.A new immobilisate of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) is described in which all components for the reaction, i.e. enzyme, the coenzyme NADP(+), the buffer and other cofactors (trace elements), are immobilized together. It is an all-inclusive catalyst. The support is a cheap, commercially-available, superabsorbent polymer. The immobilisation is easy to achieve. The superabsorbed ADH is, even when dried, a stable and storable catalyst for at least five weeks at -18 degrees C. Asymmetric reductions of the prochiral ketones, acetophenone, 4-acetylpyridine and ethyl acetoacetate, with a superabsorbed ADH from Lactobacillus brevis (ADH 002) and a superabsorbed ADH from Thermoanaerobicum sp.

19557362,"Four flavonoids from Echinosophora koreensis and their effects on alcohol metabolizing enzymes.A new prenylated dihydroflavonol, 3-hydroxy-kenusanone B 1, as well as three other known isoflavanones, sophoronol 2, sophoraisoflavanone A 3 and kenusanone H 4, were isolated from the rhizomes of Echinosophora koreensis. The structures of these compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic analyses that included extensive 2D NMR, optical rotation spectrometry and mass spectrometry. All four flavonoids enhanced the activities of alcohol metabolizing enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) at micromolar concentrations. Sophoronol 2 showed a nine-fold increased activation of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase than a negative control group at concentrations of 100 microg/mL and 50 microg/mL, respectively. This study suggests that prenylated flavonoids have the potential to prevent 'hangovers' after alcohol intake.",M1
19550411,"Alcohol intake, alcohol dehydrogenase genotypes, and liver damage and disease in the Danish general population.OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that alcohol, alone and in combination with alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) 1B and ADH1C genotypes, affects liver damage and disease in the general population. METHODS: Information on alcohol intake and on liver disease was obtained from 9,080 men and women from the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Biochemical tests for the detection of liver damage were specific for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-ALT ratio (AST/ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, coagulation factors, and erythrocyte volume. RESULTS: Increasing alcohol intake was associated with increasing erythrocyte volume, AST/ALT, and levels of ALT, gamma-GT, albumin, bilirubin, coagulation factors, and with decreasing levels of alkaline phosphatase. Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for alcoholic liver disease overall were 0.9 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-1.4), 1.4 (0.8-2.5), 1.8 (0.9-3.5), and 4.1 (2.5-7.0) for an alcohol intake of 1-13, 14-20, 21-27, and &gt; or = 28 drinks per week, respectively, compared with drinking &lt;1 drink per week (P for trend&lt;0.0001); the corresponding hazard ratios for alcoholic liver cirrhosis were 1.7 (0.6-4.7), 2.0 (0.8-7.1), 6.5 (2.0-21), and 13 (4.6-37) (P for trend&lt;0.0001). ADH1B and ADH1C genotypes were not associated with and did not modify the effect of alcohol on biochemical tests or risk of liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing alcohol intake from none to low (1-6 drinks per week) through to moderate (7-20 drinks per week) and excessive intake (&gt; or = 21 drinks per week) leads to stepwise increases in signs of liver damage with no threshold effect, and to an increased risk of liver disease. The minor changes in biochemical tests for low alcohol intake may not account for subclinical liver disease.",M1
19497388,"Alcohol dehydrogenase gene expression in Chironomus riparius exposed to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an industrial additive that is widely used as a plasticizer. Due to its widespread use, DEHP is often found in freshwater ecosystems and many freshwater species have been exposed to various levels of DEHP in natural aquatic systems. Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) is a metabolizing enzyme produced in response to exposure to DEHP. To evaluate the effects of DEHP exposure on the ADH metabolizing process of Chironomus, the full-length cDNA of ADH from Chironomus riparius was determined through molecular cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The expression of ADH was then analyzed during different life-cycle developmental stages and under various DEHP concentrations. In addition, a comparative and phylogenetic study among different orders of insects and vertebrates was conducted through analysis of sequence databases. The complete cDNA sequence of the ADH gene was 1134 bp in length. The amino acid sequence of C. riparius ADH was found to have a low degree of homology (around 70%) with other insects available in the databases. ADH mRNA was highly expressed during various developmental stages. ADH gene expression by C. riparius increased significantly after short-term exposure (24 h) to DEHP, regardless of the exposure concentration. ADH gene expression also increased in C. riparius following exposure to DEHP for 7 days. These results suggest that DEHP affects the metabolism associated with ADH in Chironomus species.",M1
19452585,"Polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 and esophageal cancer risk in Southeast Chinese males.AIM: To evaluate the impact of alcohol dehydrogenase-2 (ADH2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) polymorphisms on esophageal cancer susceptibility in Southeast Chinese males. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one esophageal cancer patients and 191 healthy controls from Taixing city in Jiangsu Province were enrolled in this study. ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes were examined by polymerase chain reaction and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The <e>ADH</e> G allele carriers were more susceptible to esophageal cancer, but no association was found between ADH2 genotypes and risk of esophageal cancer when disregarding alcohol drinking status. Regardless of ADH2 genotype, ALDH2G/A or A/A carriers had significantly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer, with homozygous individuals showing higher esophageal cancer risk than those who were heterozygous. A significant interaction between ALDH2 and drinking was detected regarding esophageal cancer risk; the OR was 3.05 (95% CI: 1.49-6.25). Compared with non-drinkers carrying both ALDH2 G/G and ADH2 A/A, drinkers carrying both ALDH2 A allele and ADH2 G allele showed a significantly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer (OR = 8.36, 95% CI: 2.98-23.46). CONCLUSION: Both ADH2 G allele and ALDH2 A allele significantly increase the risk of esophageal cancer development in Southeast Chinese males. ALDH2 A allele significantly increases the risk of esophageal cancer development especially in alcohol drinkers. Alcohol drinkers carrying both ADH2 G allele and ALDH2 A allele have a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.",M1
19444390,"New model for polymerization of oligomeric alcohol dehydrogenases into nanoaggregates.Polymerization and self-assembly of proteins into nanoaggregates of different sizes and morphologies (nanoensembles or nanofilaments) is a phenomenon that involved problems in various neurodegenerative diseases (medicine) and enzyme instability/inactivity (biotechnology). Thermal polymerization of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (dimeric) and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (tetrameric), as biotechnological <e>ADH</e> representative enzymes, was evaluated for the development of a rational strategy to control aggregation. Constructed ADH nuclei, which grew to larger amorphous nanoaggregates, were prevented via high repulsion strain of the net charge values. Good correlation between the variation in scattering and lambda(-2) was related to the amorphousness of the nanoaggregated ADHs, shown by electron microscopic images. Scattering corrections revealed that ADH polymerization was related to the quaternary structural changes, including delocalization of subunits without unfolding, i.e. lacking the 3D conformational and/or secondary-ordered structural changes. The results demonstrated that electrostatic repulsion was not only responsible for disaggregation but also caused a delay in the onset of aggregation temperature, decreasing maximum values of aggregation and amounts of precipitation. Together, our results demonstrate and propose a new model of self-assembly for ADH enzymes based on the construction of nuclei, which grow to formless nanoaggregates with minimal changes in the tertiary and secondary conformations.",M1

In this paper, carbon nanomaterial supports have been employed in conjunction with heme-c containing pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (PQQ-AldDH) oxidoreductase enzymes as oxidation catalysts to produce stable high surface area catalyst supports for the bioelectrocatalysis of ethanol in biofuel cells. The structure of PQQ-ADH and PQQ-AldDH allow for direct electron transfer (DET) between the enzymes and carbon nanomaterial support without the use of additional charge carrying chemical mediators. In this paper, the employment of nanomaterials are used to produce stable, high surface area catalyst supports which aid in enzyme adsorption and direct electron transfer. Fundamental DET studies were performed on both PQQ-ADH and PQQ-AldDH in order to understand the processes occurring at the electrode surface. Data shows a direct correlation between concentration of substrate and peak potential and peak current.

19437773,"Immobilization of alcohol dehydrogenase in phospholipid Langmuir-Blodgett films to detect ethanol.Enzyme immobilization in nanostructured films may be useful for a number of biomimetic systems, particularly if suitable matrixes are identified. Here we show that alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) has high affinity toward a negatively charged phospholipid, dimyristoylphosphatidic acid (DMPA), which forms a Langmuir monolayer at an air-water interface. Incorporation of ADH into the DMPA monolayer was monitored with surface pressure measurements and polarization-modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, with the alpha-helices from ADH being mainly oriented parallel to the water surface. ADH remained at the interface even at high surface pressures, thus allowing deposition of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films from the DMPA-ADH film. Indeed, interaction with DMPA enhances the transfer of ADH, where the mass transferred onto a solid support increased from 134 ng for ADH on a Gibbs monolayer to 178 ng for an LB film with DMPA. With fluorescence spectroscopy it was possible to confirm that the ADH structure was preserved even after one month of the LB deposition. ADH-containing films deposited onto gold-interdigitated electrodes were employed in a sensor array capable of detecting ethanol at concentrations down to 10 ppb (in volume), using impedance spectroscopy as the method of detection.",M1
19426664,"Characterization of a gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase in benznidazole-susceptible and -resistant populations of Trypanosoma cruzi.Alcohol dehydrogenases (<e>ADH</e>) are a class of oxidoreductases that catalyse the reversible oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi the TcADH gene was identified through microarray analysis as having reduced transcription in an in vitro induced benznidazole (BZ)-resistant population. In the present study, we have extended these results by characterizing the TcADH gene from 11 strains of T. cruzi that were either susceptible or naturally resistant to benznidazole and nifurtimox or had in vivo selected or in vitro induced resistance to BZ. Sequence comparisons showed that TcADH was more similar to prokaryotic ADHs than to orthologs identified Leishmania spp. Immunolocalisation using confocal microscopy revealed that TcADH is present in the kinetoplast region and along the parasite body, consistent with the mitochondrial localization predicted by sequence analysis. Northern blots showed a 1.9kb transcript with similar signal intensity in all T. cruzi samples analysed, except for the in vitro selected resistant population, where transcript levels were 2-fold lower. These findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. In Western blot analysis, anti-TcADH polyclonal antisera recognised a 42kDa protein in all T. cruzi strains tested. The level of expression of this polypeptide was approximately 2-fold lower in the in vitro induced benznidazole-resistant strain, than in the susceptible parental strain. The chromosomal location of the TcADH gene was variable, but was not associated with the zymodeme or with the drug resistance phenotype. The data presented here show that the TcADH enzyme has a decreased level of expression in the in vitro induced BZ-resistant T. cruzi population, a situation that has not been observed in the in vivo selected BZ-resistant and naturally resistant strains.",M1

There is no report on the widely studied Arg47His and Glu487Lys polymorphisms from Indian alcohol-dependent populations. In this paper, we report, for the first time, allelic and genotypic frequencies of Arg47His and Glu487Lys single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in North Indian alcohol-dependent subjects. A total of 174 alcohol-dependent males, recruited using DSM IV criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The results obtained from genetic analysis were correlated with clinical parameters using Student's t-test or Mann Whitney's U test. The highlight of the study findings was the uniquely high frequency of the ALDH2*2/*2 genotype (among alcohol-dependent subjects) being a risk-conferring factor for alcohol dependence.",M1
19401227,"Optimization of metabolic pathways for bioconversion of lignocellulose to ethanol through genetic engineering.The optimization of metabolic pathways is of fundamental importance for strategies aimed at improving the economics and yield of the lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes. Although Escherichia coli is capable of metabolizing a wide variety of substrates including hexoses and pentoses, its hexose metabolism is inferior to that of Zymomonas mobilis, an obligate, ethanologenic bacterium. We therefore inserted and expressed Z. mobilis genes encoding essential enzymes involved in the fermentation pathway, alcohol dehydrogenase II (<e>adh</e> II) and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), into E. coli, resulting in increased cell growth and ethanol production. Ethanol concentrations of &gt;30 g/L were obtained on 10% glucose. Additionally, since pyruvate is mainly assimilated through pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and forms formic acid and acetyl coenzyme A, metabolic redirection was attempted through gene knockout by Red-mediated recombination to decrease the byproducts of pyruvate metabolism. Under microaerobic conditions, pflA- and pflB-mutants produced more ethanol (163% and 207%, respectively) relative to the parent strain, using glucose as a carbon source.",M1
19382905,"Expression pattern, ethanol-metabolizing activities, and cellular localization of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in human pancreas: implications for pathogenesis of alcohol-induced pancreatic injury.BACKGROUND: Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are major enzymes responsible for metabolism of ethanol. Genetic polymorphisms of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 occur among racial populations. The metabolic effect and metabolites contribute to pathogenesis of pancreatic injury. The goal of this study was to determine the functional expressions and cellular localization of ADH and ALDH families in human pancreas. METHODS: Fifty five surgical specimens of normal pancreas as well as 15 samples each for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were investigated. Class-specific antibodies were prepared by affinity chromatographies from rabbit antisera raised against recombinant human ADH1C1, ADH4, ADH5, ADH7, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and ALDH3A1. The isozyme expression patterns of ADH/ALDH were identified by isoelectric focusing, and the activities were assayed spectrophotometrically. The protein contents of ADH/ALDH isozymes were determined by immunoblotting, and the cellular localizations were detected by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry. RESULTS: At 33 mM ethanol, pH 7.5, the activities were significantly different between allelic phenotypes of ADH1B. The activity of ALDH2-inactive phenotypes was slightly lower than ALDH2-active phenotypes at 200 microM acetaldehyde. The protein contents were in the following decreasing order: ALDH1A1, ALDH2, ADH1, and ADH5. ADH1B was detected in the acinar cells and ADH1C in the ductular, islet, and stellate cells. The expression of ADH1C appeared to be increased in the activated pancreatic stellate cells in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol dehydrogenase and ALDH family members are differentially expressed in the various cell types of pancreas. ADH1C may play an important role in modulation of activation of pancreatic stellate cells.",M1
19351582,"Biofuel cell controlled by enzyme logic network--approaching physiologically regulated devices.A  smart  biofuel cell switchable ON and OFF upon application of several chemical signals processed by an enzyme logic network was designed. The biocomputing system performing logic operations on the input signals was composed of four enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), amyloglucosidase (AGS), invertase (INV) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). These enzymes were activated by different combinations of chemical input signals: NADH, acetaldehyde, maltose and sucrose. The sequence of biochemical reactions catalyzed by the enzymes models a logic network composed of concatenated AND/OR gates. Upon application of specific  successful  patterns of the chemical input signals, the cascade of biochemical reactions resulted in the formation of gluconic acid, thus producing acidic pH in the solution. This resulted in the activation of a pH-sensitive redox-polymer-modified cathode in the biofuel cell, thus, switching ON the entire cell and dramatically increasing its power output. Application of another chemical signal (urea in the presence of urease) resulted in the return to the initial neutral pH value, when the O(2)-reducing cathode and the entire cell are in the mute state. The reversible activation-inactivation of the biofuel cell was controlled by the enzymatic reactions logically processing a number of chemical input signals applied in different combinations. The studied biofuel cell exemplifies a new kind of bioelectronic device where the bioelectronic function is controlled by a biocomputing system. Such devices will provide a new dimension in bioelectronics and biocomputing benefiting from the integration of both concepts.",M1
19348159,"Use of acetaldehyde and methanol as markers of alcohol abuse and their measurement.It is believed that ethanol metabolites (ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate) are produced when alcohol is consumed in accumulation with the binding of biological components. Additionally, it has been reported that ethanol metabolites and methanol present in the blood and urine are bound to biological components in habitual alcohol drinkers, even when alcohol has not been consumed. Consequently, with the purpose of investigating the potential for effectively using ethanol metabolite and methanol as markers of alcohol abuse, acetaldehyde level was measured in blood hemoglobin samples, and ethanol, acetaldehyde and methanol levels were measured in urine samples in healthy adult males (volunteers: control group) and alcoholics that had not consumed alcohol. Simultaneously, investigations were carried out on the genetic analysis of <e>ADH</e> and ALDH enzymes that participate in ethanol metabolism. Acetaldehyde levels were found to be significantly higher in alcoholics than in the volunteers for the period of 2 to 3 months after admission. In urine samples, acetaldehyde level (bound) was significantly higher in the period of 2 to 3 months after admission, and methanol level (free and bound) was significantly higher within a period of 1 month after admission. A correlation between alcoholics and genotype was found with regard to the distribution of ADH2 and ALDH2 genotypes (Volunteers: ADH2 2-2 type, 81%; ALDH2 1-1 type, 61.9%; Alcoholics: ADH2 2-2 type, 39.6%; ALDH2 1-1 type, 84.9%). Based on these results, alcoholism or alcohol abuse might be predicted by concentration of acetaldehyde as well as methanol during abstinence. It also might be used as markers of alcohol abuse.",M1
19345571,"Enzyme-modified nanoporous gold-based electrochemical biosensors.On the basis of the unique physical and chemical properties of nanoporous gold (NPG), which was obtained simply by dealloying Ag from Au/Ag alloy, an attempt was made in the present study to develop NPG-based electrochemical biosensors. The NPG-modified glassy carbon electrode (NPG/GCE) exhibited high-electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which resulted in a remarkable decrease in the overpotential of NADH and H(2)O(2) electro-oxidation when compared with the gold sheet electrode. The high density of edge-plane-like defective sites and large specific surface area of NPG should be responsible for the electrocatalytic behavior. Such electrocatalytic behavior of the NPG/GCE permitted effective low-potential amperometric biosensing of ethanol or glucose via the incorporation of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) or glucose oxidase (GOD) within the three-dimensional matrix of NPG. The ADH- and GOD-modified NPG-based biosensors showed good analytical performance for biosensing ethanol and glucose due to the clean, reproducible and uniformly distributed microstructure of NPG. The stabilization effect of NPG on the incorporated enzymes also made the constructed biosensors very stable. After 1 month storage at 4 degrees C, the ADH- and GOD-based biosensors lost only 5.0% and 4.2% of the original current response. All these indicated that NPG was a promising electrode material for biosensors construction.",M1
19332052,"The activity of class I, II, III and IV of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms.OBJECTIVE: Human blood vessels contain a huge amount of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which play a significant role in the metabolism of many biological substances and participate in various metabolic pathways. The aim of this study was the investigation of the differences between the activities of ADH and ALDH in the wall of aortic aneurysm and wall of healthy aorta, that can explain the pathological background of aneurysm development. METHODS: For the measurement of the activity of class I and II ADH isoenzymes and ALDH activity the fluorometric methods was employed. The total ADH activity and activity of class III and IV isoenzymes was measured by the photometric method. The study material consisted of vessels wall samples obtained from 45 abdominal aortic aneurysm. RESULTS: The activity of the class I ADH isoenzyme was significantly lower in the wall of aortic aneurysm than in healthy aorta. The other tested classes of ADH showed the tendency to lower level of the activity in aneurysm tissue than that in wall of unchanged aorta. The activities of total ADH and ALDH were also not significantly lower in the aneurysms. CONCLUSION: The decrease of the activity of class I ADH isoenzymes in the wall of aortic aneurysm may be a factor of some disorders in metabolic pathways with participation of these isoenzymes.",M1
19320452,"Effect of salt on the formation of alcohol-dehydrogenease monolayer: a study by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique.We report here the effect of salt (KCl) on the interfacial surface activity of yeast alcohol dehydogenease (<e>ADH</e>) at air/water interface using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. Effect of salt content in the water subphase on ADH structure has been studied. The change of area/molecule, compressibility, rigidity, and unfolding of ADH are insignificant up to 10 mM KCl concentration. The significant changes are observed above 0.1 M KCl concentrations. Observations are explained in the context of DLVO theory. FTIR study of amide band together with AFM imaging of ADH monolayer indicate that KCl perturbs the ADH monolayer by the increment of beta-structure resulting into larger unfolding and intermolecular aggregates at high salt concentration.",M1
19275155,"Evaluating precision and accuracy when quantifying different endogenous control reference genes in maize using real-time PCR.The agricultural biotechnology industry routinely utilizes real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for the detection of biotechnology-derived traits in plant material, particularly for meeting the requirements of legislative mandates that rely upon the trace detection of DNA. Quantification via real-time RT-qPCR in plant species involves the measurement of the copy number of a taxon-specific, endogenous control gene exposed to the same manipulations as the target gene prior to amplification. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO 21570:2005) specifies that the copy number of an endogenous reference gene be used for normalizing the concentration (expressed as a % w/w) of a trait-specific target gene when using RT-qPCR. For this purpose, the copy number of a constitutively expressed endogenous reference gene in the same sample is routinely monitored. Real-time qPCR was employed to evaluate the predictability and performance of commonly used endogenous control genes (starch synthase, SSIIb-2, SSIIb-3; alcohol dehydrogenase, <e>ADH</e>; high-mobility group, HMG; zein; and invertase, IVR) used to detect biotechnology-derived traits in maize. The data revealed relatively accurate and precise amplification efficiencies when isogenic maize was compared to certified reference standards, but highly variable results when 23 nonisogenic maize cultivars were compared to an IRMM Bt-11 reference standard. Identifying the most suitable endogenous control gene, one that amplifies consistently and predictably across different maize cultivars, and implementing this as an internationally recognized standard would contribute toward harmonized testing of biotechnology-derived traits in maize.",M1
19233665,"Differential expression levels of aroma-related genes during ripening of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.).Fruit aroma is a complex trait, particularly in terms of the number of different biosynthetic pathways involved, the complexity of the final metabolites, and their regulation. In order to understand the underlying biochemical processes involved in apricot aroma, four cDNAs (Pa-aat, EU784138; Pa-adhEU395433; Pa-pdcEU395434; and Pa-loxEU439430) encoding an alcohol acyl transferase (AAT), alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), and lipoxygenase (LOX), respectively, were isolated and characterized at four stages of maturity in Prunus armeniaca L. cv. Modesto. We observed a reduction in aldehyde and alcohol production between early-harvested fruit and late-harvest fruit, concomitant with an increase in ester production. qPCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the adh gene and the lox gene stayed constant at all stages. Interestingly, aat levels showed a sharp increase in the late-harvest stages concurrent with the changes observed in ester levels. The significance of these changes in relation to aroma production in apricot is discussed.",M1
19232490,"A novel assay for rapid in vivo determination of phenotypic stability of recombinant ethanol-producing microorganisms.A rapid empirical assay is presented for assessing the phenotypic stability of continuous cultures of recombinant bacteria containing transposed pdc and <e>adh</e> genes for ethanol production. The method measures spectrophotometrically the rate of colour formation when cells oxidize added ethanol to acetaldehyde in the presence of Schiff's reagent. During chemostat cultures of the recombinant ethanologen Escherichia coli KO11 on 20 g/l glucose, assay activities were stable and high at ca 8 x 10(-4) DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), reflecting the high, stable ethanol yield (ca 95%). On 20 g/l and 50 g/l xylose, ethanol yields declined rapidly to about 60% and this was closely mirrored by the assay activities which fell to ca 1.5 DeltaOD(540)/(s.OD(550)), only slightly higher than those measured for the parent strain. Typically taking only about an hour to perform, the assay provides a faster means of gauging the phenotypic stability of ethanol production than is possible by conventional methods.",M1
19218278,"Effects of iron depletion on Entamoeba histolytica alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (EhADH2) and trophozoite growth: implications for antiamoebic therapy.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism by which iron chelation affects the trophozoite survival of Entamoeba histolytica. Fe2+ is a cofactor for E. histolytica alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (EhADH2), an essential bifunctional enzyme [alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)] in the glycolytic pathway of E. histolytica. METHODS: We tested the effects of iron depletion on trophozoite growth, the kinetics of iron binding to EhADH2, and the activities of ADH and ALDH. RESULTS: Growth of E. histolytica trophozoites, and ADH and ALDH enzymatic activities were directly inhibited by iron chelation. Kinetics of iron binding to EhADH2 reveals the differential iron affinity of ADH (higher) and ALDH (lower). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that iron chelation interrupts the completion of the fermentative pathway of E. histolytica by removing the metal cofactor indispensable for the structural and functional stability of EhADH2, thus affecting trophozoite survival. We propose that iron-starvation-based strategies could be used to treat amoebiasis.",M1
19205389,"[Effects of H2-blockers on alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) activity]First-pass metabolism (FPM) of alcohol is demonstrated by lower blood alcohol concentrations after oral than intravenous administration of the same dose. FPM occurs predominantly in the stomach and has been attributed to class IV of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isoenzyme localizated in the gastric mucosa. A number of factors that influence on gastric ADH activity and thereby modulate FPM have been identified. These include age, sex, ethnicity, concentrations and amounts of alcohol consumed and drugs. Several H2-receptor antagonists, including cimetidine and ranitidine, inhibit gastric ADH activity and reduce FPM, resulting in higher blood alcohol concentrations after H2-blockers administration.",M1
19200331,"Quantification of the expression of reference and alcohol dehydrogenase genes of some acetic acid bacteria in different growth conditions.AIMS: The aim of this study was to develop a reliable system to analyse the expression of the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and test its ability to predict the growth and oxidative activity of some acetic acid bacteria (AAB). METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific primers were designed for use in RT-PCR to quantify ADH expression and several housekeeping genes in four species of AAB. 16S rRNA gene was selected as an internal control. The relative expression of adhA was measured in Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Gluconacetobacter hansenii and Gluconobacter oxydans grown in two media that had glucose or ethanol as the carbon source. AAB adhA expression was shown to be related to the two Acetobacter species' ability to oxidise and grow on ethanol, whereas G. oxydans were unable to grow on ethanol and the growth of Ga. hansenii was not related to adhA expression. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression of ADH could be a marker to analyse both growth and oxidation ability in some AAB, especially those of the genus Acetobacter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Several housekeeping genes were tested in AAB and after growth in different media and it was evident that only the ribosomal coding genes were adequate as reference genes for RT-PCR.",M1
19198751,"Phase I enzyme induction in Girardinichthys viviparus, an endangered goodeid fish, exposed to water from native localities enriched with polychlorinated biphenyls.The present study examines the induction of mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes, including CYP content CYP1A (EROD) activity and alcohol dehydrogenase activity (<e>ADH</e>), in an endemic Mexican fish species, the black-fin goodeid Girardinichthys viviparus, exposed to the water of two localities, Lake Texcoco (LTX) and Lake Zumpango, and to the same matrices enriched in polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to simulate the potential toxic effects of sublethal increases in these xenobiotics. Fishes of both sexes born in the laboratory were exposed for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days. Water from the two types of localities of the black-fin goodeid contains MFO inducers. Of the two, the most contaminated is LTX water, which also contains PCBs. EROD activity was higher in all treatments with female compared with male fish. This suggests greater metabolic compromise in female fish as a response to damage caused by these xenobiotics. In this species, CYP induction displayed two patterns that were not always concurrent with higher CYP1A activity. In the enriched matrix system, biotransformation processes were notably altered. Increased ADH may indicate that this enzyme is involved in the biotransformation of PCBs and their metabolites, particularly in male fish, and provides at least a part of reductive power required by the MFO enzymes; however, specific studies are needed to clarify this point.",M1
19195028,"Ethanol metabolism alters major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted antigen presentation in liver cells.The proteasome is a major enzyme that cleaves proteins for antigen presentation. Cleaved peptides traffic to the cell surface, where they are presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Recognition of these complexes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes is crucial for elimination of cells bearing  nonself  proteins. Our previous studies revealed that ethanol suppresses proteasome function in ethanol-metabolizing liver cells. We hypothesized that proteasome suppression reduces the hydrolysis of antigenic peptides, thereby decreasing the presentation of the peptide MHC class I complexes on the cell surface. To test this we used the mouse hepatocyte cell line (CYP2E1/<e>ADH</e>-transfected HepB5 cells) or primary mouse hepatocytes, both derived from livers of C57Bl/6 mice, which present the ovalbumin peptide, SIINFEKL, complexed with H2Kb. To induce H2Kb expression, HepB5 cells were treated with interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and then exposed to ethanol. In these cells, ethanol metabolism decreased not only proteasome activity, but also hydrolysis of the C-extended peptide, SIINFEKL-TE, and the presentation of SIINFEKL-H2Kb complexes measured after the delivery of SIINFEKL-TE to cytoplasm. The suppressive effects of ethanol were, in part, attributed to ethanol-elicited impairment of IFNgamma signaling. However, in primary hepatocytes, even in the absence of IFNgamma, we observed a similar decline in proteasome activity and antigen presentation after ethanol exposure. CONCLUSION: Proteasome function is directly suppressed by ethanol metabolism and indirectly by preventing the activating effects of IFNgamma. Ethanol-elicited reduction in proteasome activity contributes to the suppression of SIINFEKL-H2Kb presentation on the surface of liver cells.",M1
19193628,"<e>ADH</e> single nucleotide polymorphism associations with alcohol metabolism in vivo.We have previously found that variation in alcohol metabolism in Europeans is linked to the chromosome 4q region containing the ADH gene family. We have now typed 103 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across this region to test for allelic associations with variation in blood and breath alcohol concentrations after an alcohol challenge. In vivo alcohol metabolism was modelled with three parameters that identified the absorption and rise of alcohol concentration following ingestion, and the rate of elimination. Alleles of ADH7 SNPs were associated with the early stages of alcohol metabolism, with additional effects in the ADH1A, ADH1B and ADH4 regions. Rate of elimination was associated with SNPs in the intragenic region between ADH7 and ADH1C, and across ADH1C and ADH1B. SNPs affecting alcohol metabolism did not correspond to those reported to affect alcohol dependence or alcohol-related disease. The combined SNP associations with early- and late-stage metabolism only account for approximately 20% of the total genetic variance linked to the ADH region, and most of the variance for in vivo alcohol metabolism linked to this region is yet to be explained.",M1
19185835,"Alcohol and genetic polymorphisms: effect on risk of alcohol-related cancer.Public health guidelines aim to limit the consumption of alcoholic beverages worldwide and the subsequent health burden. In particular, alcohol consumption is an avoidable risk factor for cancer. In human beings, ethanol in alcoholic drinks is mainly oxidised in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenases to acetaldehyde, and is further detoxified to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases. Functional variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in differences between individuals in exposure to carcinogenic acetaldehyde, suggesting a possible interaction of genetic susceptibility and alcohol exposure in cancer. We reviewed available studies of the combined effects of alcohol drinking and genetic polymorphisms on alcohol-related cancer risk. Most available data were for polymorphisms in alcohol and folate metabolism. We give an overview of published studies on the combined effects of alcohol drinking and polymorphisms in genes for alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 2E1, and methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase on the risk of alcohol-related cancer. Current data lend support to a role of polymorphisms ADH1B and ALDH2 combined with alcohol consumption in cancer.

19184326,"Alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in the sera of patients with esophageal cancer.Various alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) isoenzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) exist in the human esophageal mucosa. In our last experiments we have shown that ADH and ALDH are present also in the esophageal cancer cells. Moreover, the activities of total ADH and class IV isoenzymes were significantly higher in cancer tissue than in healthy mucosa, which suggests that these changes may be reflected by enzyme activity in the serum. Therefore, we measured the activity of total alcohol dehydrogenase, and classes I-IV of this enzyme and aldehyde dehydrogenase in the sera of patients with this cancer. Serum samples were taken for routine biochemical investigation from 67 patients with esophageal cancer before treatment. Total ADH activity was measured by photometric method with p-nitrosodimethylaniline (NDMA) as a substrate and ALDH activity by the fluorometric method with 6-methoxy-2-naphtaldehyde as a substrate. For the measurement of the activity of class I and II isoenzymes, we employed the fluorometric methods, with class-specific fluorogenic substrates. The activity of class III alcohol dehydrogenase was measured by the photometric method with formaldehyde and class IV with m-nitrobenzaldehyde as a substrate. A statistically significant increase of class IV alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes was found in the sera of cancer patients. The median activity of this class isoenzyme in the total cancer group increased by about 26.5% (7.42 mU/l) in comparison to the control level (5.46 mU/l). The total alcohol dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher (30%) among patients with cancer. The activities of other tested ADH isoenzymes and total ALDH were unchanged. The activity of the class I ADH isoenzyme was significantly higher in the sera of drinkers with esophageal cancer than non-drinking patients. The increased total activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and class IV isoenzyme in the sera of patients with esophageal cancer probably can be caused by release of this isoenzyme from cancer cells or might be stimulated by alcohol drinking.",M1
19183134,"Contribution of NADH increases to ethanol's inhibition of retinol oxidation by human <e>ADH</e> isoforms.BACKGROUND: A decrease in retinoic acid levels due to alcohol consumption has been proposed as a contributor to such conditions as fetal alcohol spectrum diseases and ethanol-induced cancers. One molecular mechanism, competitive inhibition by ethanol of the catalytic activity of human alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) on all-trans-retinol oxidation has been shown for the ADH7 isoform. Ethanol metabolism also causes an increase in the free reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in cells, which might reasonably be expected to decrease the retinol oxidation rate by product inhibition of ADH isoforms. METHODS: To understand the relative importance of these two mechanisms by which ethanol decreases the retinol oxidation in vivo we need to assess them quantitatively. We have built a model system of 4 reactions: (1) ADH oxidation of ethanol and NAD(+), (2) ADH oxidation of retinol and NAD(+), (3) oxidation of ethanol by a generalized Ethanol(oxidase) that uses NAD(+), (4) NADH(oxidase) which carries out NADH turnover. RESULTS: Using the metabolic modeling package ScrumPy, we have shown that the ethanol-induced increase in NADH contributes from 0% to 90% of the inhibition by ethanol, depending on (ethanol) and ADH isoform. Furthermore, while the majority of flux control of retinaldehyde production is exerted by ADH, Ethanol(oxidase) and the NADH(oxidase) contribute as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the ethanol-induced increase in NADH makes a contribution of comparable importance to the ethanol competitive inhibition throughout the range of conditions likely to occur in vivo, and must be considered in the assessment of the in vivo mechanism of ethanol interference with fetal development and other diseases.",M1
19182438,"Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human class II alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH4) gene affect both transcriptional activity and ethanol metabolism in Japanese subjects.Class II alcohol dehydrogenase (pi-<e>ADH</e>), encoded by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH4), is considered to contribute to ethanol (EtOH) oxidation in the liver at high concentration. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the promoter region of this gene. Analysis of genotype distribution in 102 unrelated Japanese subjects revealed that four loci were in strong linkage disequilibrium and could be classified into three haplotypes. The effects of these polymorphisms on transcriptional activity were investigated in HepG2 cells. Transcriptional activity was significantly higher in cells with the -136A allele than in those with the -136C allele. To investigate whether this difference in transcriptional activity caused a difference in EtOH elimination, previous data on blood EtOH changes after 0.4 g/kg body weight alcohol ingestion were analyzed. When analyzed based on aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene (ALDH2) (487)Glu/Lys genotype, the significantly lower level of EtOH at peak in subjects with -136C/A and -136A/A genotype compared with subjects with -136C/C genotype indicated that -136 bp was a suggestive locus for differences in EtOH oxidation. This effect was observed only in subjects with ALDH2 (487)Glu/Glu. These results suggested that the SNP at -136bp in the ADH4 promoter had an effect on transcriptional regulation, and that the higher activity of the -136A allele compared with the -136C allele caused a lower level of blood EtOH after alcohol ingestion; that is, individuals with the -136A allele may consume more EtOH and might have a higher risk for development of alcohol dependence than those without the -136A allele.",M1

Molecular genetics studies have identified numerous candidate genes associated with alcoholism. It is crucial to verify the disease susceptibility genes by correlating the pinpointed allelic variations to the causal phenotypes. Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are the principal enzymes responsible for ethanol metabolism in humans. Both ADH and ALDH exhibit functional polymorphisms among racial populations; these polymorphisms have been shown to be the important genetic determinants in ethanol metabolism and alcoholism. Here, we briefly review recent advances in genomic studies of human ADH/ALDH families and alcoholism, with an emphasis on the pharmacogenetic consequences of venous blood acetaldehyde in the different ALDH2 genotypes following the intake of various doses of ethanol. This paper illustrates a paradigmatic example of phenotypic verifications in a protective disease gene for substance abuse.",M1
19160843,"[Breeding of Actinobacillus succiniogenes mutants with improved succinate production based on metabolic flux analysis]It is very important to obtain high yield mutant strains on the base of metabolic flux analysis of Actinobacillus succinogenes S.JST for the industrial bioconversion of succinic acid. The metabolic pathway was analized at first and the flux of the metabolic networks was calculated by matrix. In order to decrease acetic acid flux, the strains mutated by soft X-ray of synchronous radiation were screened on the plates with high concentration of fluoroacetic acid. For decreasing the metabolic flux of ethanol the site-directed mutagenesis was carried out for the reduction of alcohol dehydrogenase(<e>Adh</e>) specific activity. Then the enzyme activity determination and the gene sequence analysis of the mutant strain was compared with those of the parent strain. Metabolic flux analysis of the parent strain indicated that the flux of succinic acid was 1.78(mmol/g/h) and that the flux of acetic acid and ethanol were 0.60 (mmol/g/h) and 1.04( mmol/g/h), respectively. Meanwhile the metabolic pathway analysis showed that the ethanol metabolism enhanced the lacking of H electron donor during the synthesis of succinic acid and that the succinic acid flux was weakened by the metabolism of byproducts ethanol and acetic acid. Compared with the parent strain, the acetic acid flux of anti-fluoroacetic mutant strain S.JST1 was 0.024 (mmol/g/h), decreasing by 96%. Then the enzyme determination showed that the specific activity unit of phosphotransacetylase(Pta) decreased from 602 to 74 and a mutated site was founded in the pta gene of the mutant strain S.JST1. Compared with that of the parent strain S.JST1 the ethanol flux of adh-site-directed mutant strain S.JST2 was 0.020 (mmol/g/h), decreasing by 98%. Then the enzyme determination showed that the specific activity unit of Adh decreased from 585 to 62 and the yield of end product succinic acid was 65.7 (g/L). The interdiction of Adh and Pta decreased the metabolism of byproducts and the H electron donor was well balanced, thus the succinic acid flux was strengthened by the redundant carbon flux from these byproducts. The mutant strain S.JST2 obtained in this paper deserves being extended to application of industrial fermentation.",M1
19154371,"Sexual selection accelerates the elimination of a deleterious mutant in Drosophila melanogaster.Although theory indicates that indirect genetic benefits through mate choice should be widespread, empirical work has often either failed to detect the operation of such benefits or shown a net cost to the presence of sexual selection. We tested whether sexual selection can increase the speed with which a conditionally deleterious allele is removed from a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster. The alcohol dehydrogenase null allele (<e>Adh</e>-) confers slightly lower viability than wild-type alleles in the absence of ethanol but is lethal in homozygotes when ethanol comprises 6% of the medium. We tracked the frequency of this allele in artificially constructed populations reared at three different levels of ethanol (0%, 2%, and 4%) that either experienced sexual selection or did not. Loss of the deleterious Adh- allele was more rapid when sexual selection was allowed to act, especially in the presence of ethanol. We also quantified the strength of both nonsexual and sexual selection against the Adh- allele using maximum-likelihood estimation. In contrast to recent experiments employing monogamy/polygamy designs, our results demonstrate a fitness benefit to sexual selection. This is consistent with the operation of good-genes female choice.",M1
19146995,"Oxidation of Cys278 of <e>ADH</e> I isozyme from Kluyveromyces lactis by naturally occurring disulfides causes its reversible inactivation.The inactivation of the homotetrameric cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase I from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlADH I) by naturally occurring disulfides, oxidized glutathione, cystine and cystamine, was studied. The inactivation was fully reversed by dithiothreitol. The nicotinamide coenzyme, but not the substrate ethanol, protected KlADH I from inactivation. Gel filtration experiments and SDS-PAGE analysis, also, revealed that enzyme inactivation coincides with inter-subunits disulfide bond formation which are noticeably enhanced after prolonged oxidation with GSSG. Moreover, oxidized KlADH I, as its reduced state, retained the tetrameric stucture and appears mainly as a dimer under non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Conversely, KlADH I Cys278Ile mutant is unaffected by disulfides treatment. Therefore, in vitro, KlADH I wild-type could exist in two reversible forms: reduced (active) and oxidized (inactive), in which the Cys278 residues of each tetramer are linked by disulfide bonds. The redox state of KlADH I could represent the path for modulating its activity and then a regulatory step of glycolysis under hypoxic conditions. It might be hypothesized that KlADH I could represent an important target in redox signaling of Kluyveromyces lactis cell by inhibiting, under oxidative stress, the glycolytic pathway in favor of the pentose-phosphate shunt to restore its reducing potential.",M1

19115036,"Molecular characterization of the recombinant iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon, Thermococcus strain ES1.The gene encoding a thermostable iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermococcus Strain ES1 (ES1 <e>ADH</e>) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant and native ES1 ADHs were purified using multistep column chromatography under anaerobic conditions. Both enzymes appeared to be homotetramers with a subunit size of 45+/-1 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE, which was close to the calculated value (44.8 kDa). The recombinant ADH contained 1.0+/-0.1 g-atom iron per subunit. Both enzymes were sensitive to oxygen with a half-life upon exposure to air of about 4 min. The recombinant enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 105+/-2 U mg(-1), which was very similar to that of the native enzyme (110+/-3 U mg(-1)). The optimal pH-values for both enzymes for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction were 10.4 and 7.0, respectively. Both enzymes also showed similar temperature-dependent activities, and catalyzed the oxidation of primary alcohols, but there was no activity towards methanol and secondary alcohols. Kinetic parameters of the enzymes showed lower K (m)-values for acetaldehyde and NADPH and higher K (m)-values for ethanol and NADP(+). It is concluded that the gene encoding ES1 ADH was expressed successfully in E. coli. This is the first report of a fully active recombinant version of an iron-containing ADH from a hyperthermophile.",M1
19110411,"Electrochemiluminescence detection of NADH and ethanol based on partial sulfonation of sol-gel network with gold nanoparticles.We developed a stable, sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on the synthesis of a new sol-gel material with the ion-exchange capacity sol-gel to coimmobilize the Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and enzyme. The partial sulfonated (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane sol-gel (PSSG) film acted as both an ion exchanger for the immobilization of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and a matrix to immobilize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film modified electrode allowed sensitive the ECL detection of NADH as low as 1 nM. Such an ability of AuNPs/PSSG/Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) film to promote the electron transfer between Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and the electrode suggested a new, promising biocompatible platform for the development of dehydrogenase-based ECL biosensors. With alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) as a model, we then constructed an ethanol biosensor, which had a linear range of 5 microM to 5.2 mM with a detection limit of 12nM.",M1
19109675,"Biocatalytical production of (5S)-hydroxy-2-hexanone.Biocatalytical approaches have been investigated in order to improve accessibility of the bifunctional chiral building block (5S)-hydroxy-2-hexanone ((S)-2). As a result, a new synthetic route starting from 2,5-hexanedione (1) was developed for (S)-2, which is produced with high enantioselectivity (ee &gt;99%). Since (S)-2 can be reduced further to furnish (2S,5S)-hexanediol ((2S,5S)-3), chemoselectivity is a major issue. Among the tested biocatalysts the whole-cell system S. cerevisiae L13 surpasses the bacterial dehydrogenase <e>ADH</e>-T in terms of chemoselectivity. The use of whole-cells of S. cerevisiae L13 affords (S)-2 from prochiral 1 with 85% yield, which is 21% more than the value obtained with ADH-T. This is due to the different reaction rates of monoreduction (1--&gt;2) and consecutive reduction (2--&gt;3) of the respective biocatalysts. In order to optimise the performance of the whole-cell-bioreduction 1 2 with S. cerevisiae, the system was studied in detail, revealing interactions between cell-physiology and xenobiotic substrate and by-products, respectively. This study compares the whole-cell biocatalytic route with the enzymatic route to enantiopure (S)-2 and investigates factors determining performance and outcome of the bioreductions.",M1
19082766,"Cloning, expression, and characterization of a novel (S)-specific alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir.A gene encoding a novel (S)-specific NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (LK-<e>ADH</e>) was isolated from the genomic DNA of Lactobacillus kefir DSM 20587 by thermal asymmetric interlaced-polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of (S)-LK-ADH gene (adhS) was determined, which consists of an open reading frame of 1,044 bp, coding for 347 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37.065 kDa. After a BLAST similarity search in GenBank database, the amino acid sequence of (S)-LK-ADH showed some homologies to several zinc containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases. This novel gene was deposited into GenBank with the accession number of EU877965. adhS gene was subcloned into plasmid pET-28a(+), and recombinant (S)-LK-ADH was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Purified enzyme showed a high enantioselectivity in the reduction of acetophenone to (S)-phenylethanol with an ee value of 99.4%.

The corresponding genes Ta0841 and Ta1316 encode proteins of 336 and 328 amino acids with molecular masses of 36.48 and 36.01 kDa, respectively. The genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzymes were functionally assessed for activity. Throughout the study only Ta1316 ADH resulted active in the oxidative reaction in the pH range 2-8 (optimal pH 5.0) and temperatures from 25 to 90 degrees C (optimal 75 degrees C). This ADH catalyzes the oxidation of several alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, 2-propanol, butanol, and pentanol during the reduction of the cofactor NAD(+). The highest activity was found in the presence of ethanol producing optically pure acetaldehyde. The specific enzyme activity of the purified Ta1316 ADH with ethanol as a substrate in the optimal conditions was 628.7 U/mg.",M1
19034537,"Inhibition of a Zn(II)-containing enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, by anticancer antibiotics, mithramycin and chromomycin A3.One of the major attributes for the biological action of the aureolic acid anticancer antibiotics chromomycin A(3) (CHR) and mithramycin (MTR) is their ability to bind bivalent cations such as Mg(II) and Zn(II) ions and form high affinity 2:1 complexes in terms of the antibiotic and the metal ion, respectively. As most of the cellular Zn(II) ion is found to be associated with proteins, we have examined the effect of MTR/CHR on the structure and function of a representative structurally well characterized Zn(II) metalloenzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) from yeast. MTR and CHR inhibit enzyme activity of ADH with inhibitory constants of micromolar order. Results from size-exclusion column chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry have suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of the metalloenzyme by the antibiotics is due to the antibiotic-induced disruption of the enzyme quaternary structure. The nature of the enzyme inhibition, the binding stoichiometry of two antibiotics per monomer, and comparable dissociation constants for the antibiotic and free (or substrate-bound) ADH imply that the association occurs as a consequence of the binding of the antibiotics to Zn(II) ion present at the structural center. Confocal microscopy shows the colocalization of the antibiotic and the metalloenzyme in HepG2 cells, thereby supporting the proposition of physical association between the antibiotic(s) and the enzyme inside the cell.",M1
19033156,"Direct evidence that genetic variation in glycerol-3-phosphate and malate dehydrogenase genes (Gpdh and Mdh1) affects adult ethanol tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster.Many studies of alcohol adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster have focused on the <e>Adh</e> polymorphism, yet the metabolic elimination of alcohol should involve many enzymes and pathways. Here we evaluate the effects of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh) and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (Mdh1) genotype activity on adult tolerance to ethanol. We have created a set of P-element-excision-derived Gpdh, Mdh1, and Adh alleles that generate a range of activity phenotypes from full to zero activity. Comparisons of paired Gpdh genotypes possessing 10 and 60% normal activity and 66 and 100% normal activity show significant effects where higher activity increases tolerance. Mdh1 null allele homozygotes show reductions in tolerance. We use piggyBac FLP-FRT site-specific recombination to create deletions and duplications of Gpdh. Duplications show an increase of 50% in activity and an increase of adult tolerance to ethanol exposure. These studies show that the molecular polymorphism associated with GPDH activity could be maintained in natural populations by selection related to adaptation to alcohols. Finally, we examine the interactions between activity genotypes for Gpdh, Mdh1, and Adh. We find no significant interlocus interactions. Observations on Mdh1 in both Gpdh and Adh backgrounds demonstrate significant increases in ethanol tolerance with partial reductions (50%) in cytosolic MDH activity. This observation strongly suggests the operation of pyruvate-malate and, in particular, pyruvate-citrate cycling in adaptation to alcohol exposure. We propose that an understanding of the evolution of tolerance to alcohols will require a system-level approach, rather than a focus on single enzymes.",M1
19022233,"Activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenases on benzyl alcohols and benzaldehydes: characterization of ADH1 from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and transition state analysis.The substrate specificities of yeast alcohol dehydrogenases I and II from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SceADH1 and SceADH2) and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis (ScbADH1) were studied. For this work, the gene for the S. carlsbergensis ADH1 was cloned, sequenced and expressed. The amino acid sequence of ScbADH1 differs at four positions as compared to SceADH1, including substitutions of two glutamine residues with glutamic acid residues, and has the same sequence as the commercial yeast enzyme, which apparently is prepared from S. carlsbergensis. The electrophoretic mobilities of ScbADH1, SceADH2 and commercial <e>ADH</e> are similar. The kinetics and specificities of ScbADH1 and SceADH1 acting on branched, long-chain and benzyl alcohols are very similar, but the catalytic efficiency of SceADH2 is about 10-100-fold higher on these substrates. A three-dimensional structure of SceADH1 shows that the substrate binding pocket has Met-270, whereas SceADH2 has Leu-270, which allows larger substrates to bind. The reduction of a series of p-substituted benzaldehydes catalyzed by SceADH2 is significantly enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups, whereas the oxidation of p-substituted aromatic alcohols may be only slightly affected by the substituents. The substituent effects on catalysis generally reflect the effects on the equilibrium constant for the reaction, where electron-withdrawing substituents favor alcohol. The results are consistent with a transition state that is electronically similar to the alcohol, supporting previous results obtained with commercial yeast ADH.",M1
19014920,"Polymorphism of ethanol-metabolism genes and alcoholism: correlation of allelic variations with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences.Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are the principal enzymes responsible for metabolism of ethanol. Both ADH and ALDH exhibit genetic polymorphisms among racial populations. Functional variant alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 have been consistently replicated to show protection against developing alcohol dependence. Multiple logistic regression analyses suggest that ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 may independently influence the risk for alcoholism. It has been well documented that homozygosity of ALDH2*2 almost fully protects against developing alcoholism and that the heterozygosity only affords a partial protection to varying degrees. Correlations of blood ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations, cardiovascular hemodynamic responses, and subjective perceptions have been investigated in men with different combinatorial ADH1B and ALDH2 genotypes following challenge with ethanol for a period of 130 min. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences indicate that acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol, is primarily responsible for the observed alcohol sensitivity reactions, suggesting that the full protection by ALDH2*2/*2 can be ascribed to the intense unpleasant physiological and psychological reactions caused by persistently elevated blood acetaldehyde after ingesting a small amount of alcohol and that the partial protection by ALDH2*1/*2 can be attributed to a faster elimination of acetaldehyde and the lower accumulation in circulation. ADH1B polymorphism does not significantly contribute to buildup of the blood acetaldehyde. Physiological tolerance or innate insensitivity to acetaldehyde may be crucial for development of alcohol dependence in alcoholics carrying ALDH2*2.",M1
19013301,"Phytophenols in whisky lower blood acetaldehyde level by depressing alcohol metabolism through inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (class I) in mice.We recently reported that the maturation of whisky prolongs the exposure of the body to a given dose of alcohol by reducing the rate of alcohol metabolism and thus lowers the blood acetaldehyde level (Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 2007;31:77s-82s). In this study, administration of the nonvolatile fraction of whisky was found to lower the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood of mice by depressing alcohol metabolism through the inhibition of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>). Four of the 12 phenolic compounds detected in the nonvolatile fraction (caffeic acid, vanillin, syringaldehyde, ellagic acid), the amounts of which increase during the maturation of whisky, were found to strongly inhibit mouse ADH 1 (class I). Their inhibition constant values for ADH 1 were 0.08, 7.9, 15.6, and 22.0 mumol/L, respectively, whereas that for pyrazole, a well-known ADH inhibitor, was 5.1 mumol/L. The 2 phenolic aldehydes and ellagic acid exhibited a mixed type of inhibition, whereas caffeic acid showed the competitive type. When individually administered to mice together with ethanol, each of these phytophenols depressed the elimination of ethanol, thereby lowering the acetaldehyde concentration of blood. Thus, it was demonstrated that the enhanced inhibition of liver ADH 1 due to the increased amounts of these phytophenols in mature whisky caused the depression of alcohol metabolism and a consequent lowering of blood acetaldehyde level. These substances are commonly found in various food plants and act as antioxidants and/or anticarcinogens. Therefore, the intake of foods rich in them together with alcohol may not only diminish the metabolic toxicity of alcohol by reducing both the blood acetaldehyde level and oxidative stress, but also help limit the amount of alcohol a person drinks by depressing alcohol metabolism.",M1
19011745,"Medium- and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene and protein families : The role of zinc for alcohol dehydrogenase structure and function.Zinc plays an important role in the structure and function of many enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenases (<e>ADHs</e>) of the MDR type (mediumchain dehydrogenases/reductases). Active site zinc participates in catalytic events, and structural site zinc maintains structural stability. MDR-types of ADHs have both of these zinc sites but with some variation in ligands and spacing. The catalytic zinc sites involve three residues with different spacings from two separate protein segments, while the structural zinc sites involve four residues and cover a local segment of the protein chain (Cys97-Cys111 in horse liver class I ADH). This review summarizes properties of both ADH zinc sites, and relates them to zinc sites of proteins in general. In addition, it highlights a separate study of zinc binding peptide variants of the horse liver ADH structural zinc site. The results show that zinc coordination of the free peptide differs markedly from that of the enzyme (one His / three Cys versus four Cys), suggesting that the protein zinc site is in an energetically strained conformation relative to that of the peptide. This finding is a characteristic of an entatic state, implying a functional nature for this zinc site.",M1
18996923,"Associations of <e>ADH</e> and ALDH2 gene variation with self report alcohol reactions, consumption and dependence: an integrated analysis.Alcohol dependence (AD) is a complex disorder with environmental and genetic origins. The role of two genetic variants in ALDH2 and ADH1B in AD risk has been extensively investigated. This study tested for associations between nine polymorphisms in ALDH2 and 41 in the seven ADH genes, and alcohol-related flushing, alcohol use and dependence symptom scores in 4597 Australian twins. The vast majority (4296) had consumed alcohol in the previous year, with 547 meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for AD. There were study-wide significant associations (P&lt;2.3 x 10(-4)) between ADH1B-Arg48His (rs1229984) and flushing and consumption, but only nominally significant associations (P&lt;0.01) with dependence. Individuals carrying the rs1229984 G-allele (48Arg) reported a lower prevalence of flushing after alcohol (P=8.2 x 10(-7)), consumed alcohol on more occasions (P=2.7 x 10(-6)), had a higher maximum number of alcoholic drinks in a single day (P=2.7 x 10(-6)) and a higher overall alcohol consumption (P=8.9 x 10(-8)) in the previous year than those with the less common A-allele (48His). After controlling for rs1229984, an independent association was observed between rs1042026 (ADH1B) and alcohol intake (P=4.7 x 10(-5)) and suggestive associations (P&lt;0.001) between alcohol consumption phenotypes and rs1693482 (ADH1C), rs1230165 (ADH5) and rs3762894 (ADH4). ALDH2 variation was not associated with flushing or alcohol consumption, but was weakly associated with AD measures. These results bridge the gap between DNA sequence variation and alcohol-related behavior, confirming that the ADH1B-Arg48His polymorphism affects both alcohol-related flushing in Europeans and alcohol intake. The absence of study-wide significant effects on AD results from the low P-value required when testing multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotypes.",M1
18951774,"Ethanol physiology in the warehouse-staining fungus, Baudoinia compniacensis.The fungus Baudoinia compniacensis colonizes the exterior surfaces of a range of materials, such as buildings, outdoor furnishings, fences, signs, and vegetation, in regions subject to periodic exposure to low levels of ethanol vapour, such as those in the vicinity of distillery aging warehouses and commercial bakeries. Here we investigated the basis of ethanol metabolism in Baudoinia and investigate the role of ethanol in cell germination and growth. Germination of mycelia of Baudoinia was enhanced by up to roughly 1d exposure to low ethanol concentrations, optimally 10ppm when delivered in vapour form and 5mm in liquid form. However, growth was strongly inhibited following exposure to higher ethanol concentrations for shorter durations (e.g., 1.7m for 6h). We found that ethanol was catabolized into central metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ACDH). Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) were active in cells grown on glucose, but these enzymes were not expressed when ethanol was provided as a sole or companion carbon source. The glyoxylate cycle enzymes isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS) activities observed in cells grown on acetate were comparable to those reported for other microorganisms. By replenishing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, it is likely that the functionality of the glyoxylate cycle is important in the establishment of luxuriant growth of Baudoinia compniacensis on ethanol-exposed, nutrient-deprived, exposed surfaces. In other fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ADH II catalyses the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, which then can be metabolized via the TCA cycle. ADH II is known to be strongly repressed in the presence of glucose.",M1
18947901,"Waterlogging-induced increase in sugar mobilization, fermentation, and related gene expression in the roots of mung bean (Vigna radiata).The objective of this study was to examine the role of root carbohydrate levels and metabolism in the waterlogging tolerance of contrasting mung bean genotypes. An experiment was conducted with two cultivated mung bean (Vigna radiata) genotypes viz., T44 (tolerant) and Pusa Baisakhi (PB) (susceptible), and a wild Vigna species Vigna luteola under pot-culture to study the physiological and molecular mechanism of waterlogging tolerance. Waterlogging resulted in decrease in relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI) in root and leaf tissues, and chlorophyll (Chl) content in leaves, while the Chl a/b ratio increased. Waterlogging-induced decline in RWC, MSI, Chl and increase in Chl a/b ratio was greater in PB than V. luteola and T44. Waterlogging caused decline in total and non-reducing sugars in all the genotypes and reducing sugars in PB, while the content of reducing sugar increased in V. luteola and T44. The pattern of variation in reducing sugar content in the 3 genotypes was parallel to sucrose synthase (SS) activity. V. luteola and T44 also showed fewer declines in total and non-reducing sugars and greater increase in reducing sugar and SS activity than PB. Activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) increased up to 8d of waterlogging in V. luteola and T44, while in PB a marginal increase was observed only up to 4d of treatment. Gene expression studies done by RT-PCR in 24h waterlogged plants showed enhanced expression of ADH and SS in the roots of V. luteola and T44, while in PB there was no change in expression level in control or treated plants. PCR band products were cloned and sequenced, and partial cDNAs of 531, 626, and 667; 702, 736, and 744bp of SS and ADH, respectively were obtained. The partial cDNA sequences of cloned SS genes showed 93-100 homologies among different genotypes and with D10266, while in case of ADH the similarity was in the range of 97-100% amongst each other and with Z23170. The results suggest that the availability of sufficient sugar reserve in the roots, activity of SS to provide reducing sugars for glycolytic activity and ADH for the recycling of NADH, and for the continuation of glycolysis, could be one of the important mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance of V. radiata genotype T44 and wild species V. luteola. This was reflected in better RWC and Chl content in leaves, and membrane stability of leaf and root tissue in V. luteola and T44.",M1

The differences in activities of <e>ADH</e> and ALDH between cancer tissues and normal mucosa might be a factor for metabolic changes and disturbances in low- mature cancer cells, might be a reason for the high level of acetaldehyde and intensifying carcinogenesis.

18942333,"[Alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase as tumour markers and factors intensifying carcinogenesis in liver cancer]Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between alcohol consumption and the development of liver cancer. The metabolism of ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) leads to generation of carcinogenic acetaldehyde. AIM OF THE STUDY: Comparison of the ADH isoenzymes activity and the activity of ALDH between liver cancer cells and healthy liver tissue. Assessment activity of these enzymes in the serum of patients with liver cancer as potential tumour markers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cancer tissue and serum were taken from 42 liver cancer patients. Seventeen patients had primary cancer and 25 metastatic liver tumors. The total ADH activity and activity of class III and IV isoenzymes were measured by the photometric method and the activity of class I and II ADH isoenzymes and ALDH by spectrofluorometric method. RESULTS: The activities of total ADH, ALDH and class I ADH were significantly higher in cancer liver cells than in healthy liver. There were no differences of ADH and ALDH activity between primary and metastatic tumours. In the serum of patients with liver cancer the total activity of ADH and ADH I were significantly higher than in healthy subjects. The total activity of ADH and ADH I were higher in the serum of patients with metastatic liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the activities of total ADH, ALDH and class I ADH isoenzyme between cancer liver tissues and healthy hepatocytes might be a factor in ethanol metabolism disorders, which can intensify carcinogenesis. The increase mainly of the ADH I activity in the serum of patients with metastatic tumors seems to be caused by the enzyme released from liver cancer cells and primary tumors originating in other organs. Obtained results indicate that the activity of ADH I and total activity of ADH in the serum may be a markers of primary and secondary liver cancers.",M1
18929533,"Protein aggregates as depots for the release of biologically active compounds.Protein misfolding and aggregation is one of the most serious problems in cell biology, molecular medicine, and biotechnology. Misfolded proteins interact with each other or with other proteins in non-productive or damaging ways. However, a new paradigm arises that protein aggregation may be exploited by nature to perform specific functions in different biological contexts. From this consideration, acceleration of stress-induced protein aggregation triggered by any factor resulting in the formation of soluble aggregates may have paradoxical positive consequences. Here, we suggest that amorphous aggregates can act as a source for the release of biologically active proteins after removal of stress conditions. To address this concept, we investigated the kinetics of thermal aggregation in vitro of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) as a model substrate in the presence of two amphiphilic peptides: Arg-Phe or Ala-Phe-Lys. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and turbidimetry, we have demonstrated that under mild stress conditions the concentration-dependent acceleration of ADH aggregation by these peptides results in formation of large but soluble complexes of proteins prone to refolding.",M1
18853207,"Effects of industrial storage on the bioreduction capacity of brewer's yeast.The effects of industrial storage on the changes of the cell viability and the activities of intracellular alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in brewer's yeast, and the corresponding capacity for the bioconversion of ethyl-3-oxobutanoate (EOB) to ethyl (S)-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-EHB), were investigated. The viability of fresh brewer's yeast cells stored in industrial circulating cooling water at 1-2 degrees C showed 4 and 15% drop after the storage of 7 and 15 days, respectively, after which cells died rapidly. The pretreatment of the stored brewer's yeast cells by washing and screening significantly enhanced cell viability during industrial storage. The intracellular levels of ADH and G6PDH after permeabilization of these stored cells with cetyltrimetylammonium bromide (CTAB) were much higher, which showed only slight decrease within 2 weeks during the industrial storage. When the stored cells after the permeabilization treatment was used as the biocatalyst at 90-120 g/L, EOB was converted almost completely into enantiopure (S)-EHB with an enantiomeric excess (ee) more than 99% and a yield of over 96%, by fed-batch bioconversion of 560 mM EOB within 6 h.",M1
18850316,"Zinc binding to peptide analogs of the structural zinc site in alcohol dehydrogenase: implications for an entatic state.Zinc binding to the peptide replica and analogs to residues 93-115 of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) was examined by competition of the peptides and the chromophoric chelator 4-(2- pyridylazo)resorcinol for zinc and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis of the zinc ligands. In the enzyme, zinc is coordinated by four Cys residues. In the peptide replica, zinc is bound to three Cys and one His residue. A four-Cys zinc coordination is observed only when His is removed, leading to increased zinc stability. ADH crystal structures reveal that the epsilon-amino group of the conserved residue Lys323 is within H-bond distance of the backbone amide oxygens of residues 103, 105 and 108, likely stabilizing the zinc coordination in the enzyme. The peptide data thus indicate structural strain and increased energy in the zinc-binding site in the protein, characteristic of an entatic state, implying a functional nature for this zinc site.",M1
18850096,"Purification of an alcohol dehydrogenase involved in the conversion of methional to methionol in Oenococcus oeni IOEB 8406.Oenococcus oeni, the major lactic acid bacteria involved in malolactic fermentation (MLF) in wine, is able to produce volatile sulfur compounds from methionine. Methional reduction is the last enzymatic step of methionol synthesis in methionine catabolism. Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) activity was found to be present in the soluble fraction of O. oeni IOEB 8406. An NAD(P)H-dependent ADH involved in the reduction of methional was then purified to homogeneity. Sequencing of the purified enzyme and amino acid sequence comparison with the database revealed the presence of a conserved sequence motif specific to the medium-chain zinc-containing NAD(P)H-dependent ADHs. Despite the great importance of ADH activities in wine flavor modification, this is the first report of the purification of an ADH isolated from O. oeni. The purified ADH does not seem to be involved in the modification of buttery and lactic notes or to be involved in the specific formation of volatile alcohols during MLF. The enzyme was not strictly specific of methional reduction and the highest reducing activity was obtained with acetaldehyde as substrate. The function of the purified ADH remains unclear, although the role of the sulfur atom in methional molecules in the interaction between enzyme and substrate was evidenced.",M1

Evidence is presented for six opossum ADH genes localized on chromosome 5 and organized in a comparable ADH gene cluster to that reported for human and rat ADH genes. The predicted amino acid sequences and secondary structures for the opossum ADH subunits and the intron-exon boundaries for opossum ADH genes showed a high degree of similarity with other mammalian ADHs, and four opossum ADH classes were identified, namely ADH1, ADH3, ADH6 and ADH4 (for which three genes were observed: ADH4A, ADH4B and ADH4C). Previous biochemical analyses of opossum ADHs have reported the tissue distribution and properties for these enzymes: ADH1, the major liver enzyme; ADH3, widely distributed in opossum tissues with similar kinetic properties to mammalian class 3 ADHs; and ADH4, for which several forms were localized in extrahepatic tissues, especially in the digestive system and in the eye. These ADHs are likely to perform similar functions to those reported for other mammalian ADHs in the metabolism of ingested and endogenous alcohols and aldehydes. Phylogenetic analyses examined opossum, human, rat, chicken and cod ADHs, and supported the proposed designation of opossum ADHs as class I (ADH1), class III (ADH3), class IV (ADH4A, ADH4B and ADH4C) and class VI (ADH6). Percentage substitution rates were examined for ADHs during vertebrate evolution which indicated that ADH3 is evolving at a much slower rate to that of the other ADH classes.",M1
18845238,"Mechanism of alcohol-induced oxidative stress and neuronal injury.Neuro-cognitive deficits, neuronal injury, and neurodegeneration are well documented in alcoholics, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Oxidative damage of mitochondria and cellular proteins intertwines with the progression of neuroinflammation and neurological disorders initiated by alcohol abuse. Here, we present the evidence that metabolism of ethanol in primary human neurons by alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) or cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) via induction of NADPH/xanthine oxidase (NOX/XOX) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in human neurons. The acetaldehyde-mediated increase in NOX, XOX, or NOS activity is regulated as a transcriptional rather than a translational process. Marked increase in the lipid peroxidation product (4-hydroxynonenal) and enhanced ROS generation coincides with decreased neuronal viability and diminished expression of neuronal marker (neurofilaments). Novel quantitative methods of ROS and NO detection help dissect the mechanisms of alcohol-induced neurodegeneration.

Don) and Meizao/Mahaleb (P. mahaleb L.) as test materials, the respiration intensity and respiratory enzyme activities of their growing roots and brown lignified roots were determined under waterlogging. The results showed that under waterlogging, the root respiration intensity of the two kind rootstocks had a decreasing trend, with more decrement for their growing roots. For P. serrulata, the decrement of the respiration intensity of its growing roots and brown lignified roots was 1.47 and 1.36 times as much as that of P. mahaleb, respectively. The pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities of the two kind roots had a decrease after an initial increase. Alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) activity in growing roots also had a decrease after an initial increase, but that in brown lignified roots had an increasing trend. The test three enzyme activities changed more in growing roots than in brown lignified roots. The increment of ADH and LDH activities was higher for P. serrulata than for P. mahaleb, while PDC activity was in adverse. The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of the two kind roots decreased, and the decrement was larger in growing roots than in brown lignified roots. P. serrulata had a larger decrement of root MDH activity than P. mahaleb To the waterlogging stress, growing roots was more sensitive than brown lignified roots, and P. serrulata was more sensitive than P. mahaleb.",M1
18836025,"Regulation of aromatic alcohol production in Candida albicans.Colonization by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans varies significantly, depending upon the pH and availability of oxygen. Because of our interest in extracellular molecules as potential quorum-sensing molecules, we examined the physiological conditions which regulate the production of the aromatic alcohols, i.e., phenethyl alcohol, tyrosol, and tryptophol. The production of these fusel oils has been well studied for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data show that aromatic alcohol yields for C. albicans are determined by growth conditions. These conditions include the availability of aromatic amino acids, the pH, oxygen levels, and the presence of ammonium salts. For example, for wild-type C. albicans, tyrosol production varied 16-fold merely with the inclusion of tyrosine or ammonium salts in the growth medium. Aromatic alcohol production also depends on the transcription regulator Aro80p. Our results are consistent with aromatic alcohol production-aromatic transaminases (gene products for ARO8 and ARO9), aromatic decarboxylase (ARO10), and alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>)-via the fusel oil pathway. The expression of ARO8, ARO9, and ARO10 is also pH dependent. ARO8 and ARO9 were alkaline upregulated, while ARO10 was alkaline downregulated. The alkaline-dependent change in expression of ARO8 was Rim101 independent, while the expression of ARO9 was Rim101 dependent.",M1
18828806,"Alterations in ethyl alcohol pharmacokinetics during oral consumption of malt liquor beverages in African Americans.BACKGROUND: Malt liquor (ML) beverages have become increasingly popular among urban minority groups, due partly to their inexpensive price and targeted advertising. We hypothesized that nonfermented by-products contained in ML beverages will alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of its ethanol content. In addition, we determined the effect of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) genotypes on the PK following consumption of ML beverages. METHODS: The study was conducted in 31 healthy adult African-American social drinkers, mean +/- SD age of 22.3 +/- 1.3 years, and weight of 70.7 +/- 10.9 kg. Participants were administered ethanol, in randomized order, 2-weeks apart, in the form of oral ML beverage (6%v/v), or isocaloric solution of diet soda-ethanol (DS-Etoh) beverage (6%v/v). During each session the beverage was consumed over 4 minutes and breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) as well as subjective and behavioral effects of ethanol were evaluated over 180 minutes. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol were calculated using Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics. The effect of ML and ADH genotype on PK was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test, respectively. RESULTS: Results show a slower mean rate of absorption, K(a), (0.12 vs. 0.15 min(-1), p = 0.03) and a longer time to reach maximum concentration, T(max), (28 vs. 23 minute, p &lt; 0.01) for the ML compared with DS-Etoh beverage. The ML beverage resulted in a larger area under the BrAC-time curve compared with DS-Etoh beverage (8.4 vs. 6.8 min g/dl, p = 0.02). There was no difference in the subjective PD effects between the 2 beverages. CONCLUSION: Results show that exposure to ethanol following the consumption of ML beverages is different compared to that following nonmalt beverages in African-Americans. These differences may be related to nonfermented by-products present in commercially available ML products. These PK differences do not appear to result in significant perceived alcohol PD changes, nor are they related to ADH genotype.",M1
18817191,"Purification and characterization of alcohol dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter suboxydans.Purification and characterization of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>) from Gluconobacter suboxydans was done in order to biotechnological and industrial application. Solubilization of enzyme from bacterial membrane fraction by Triton X-100 and subsequent fractionation on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and Hydroxyapatite was successful in enzyme purification. Enzyme assay reaction mixture contained potassium ferricyanide 0.1 M, McIlvaine buffer 0.1 M (pH 5.5), Triton X-100 10%, ethanol 1 M and enzyme solution. The purified ADH Optimum pH activity was 5.5. The enzyme was in maximum stability in pH 5.8. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was determined using the same enzyme assay method as described above, except that various substrates (100 mM) were used instead of ethanol. The relative activity of the ADH for ethanol was higher than the others. The effects of metal ions and inhibitors on the activity of the enzyme were examined by measuring the activity using the same assay method as described above. Activity of purified enzyme was increased in the presence of Ca(+2) and was decreased in presence the of ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). Because the proper structure and function of the enzyme is related to structural Ca(+2) and EDTA can chelate Ca(+2). An apparent Michaelis constant for ethanol were examined to be 1.7 x 10(-3) M for ethanol as substrate.",M1
18802746,"Tissue expression pattern of class II and class V genes found in the <e>Adh</e> complex on mouse chromosome 3.The alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes in mice and humans are encoded by a linked group of genes in the same transcriptional orientation. The enzymes play important roles in alcohol metabolism and retinoid signaling and homeostasis. The expression patterns at the mRNA level of the mouse Adh4 (class II) gene and the recently identified Adh6a and Adh6b genes (class V) are now reported to complete this analysis for the entire family. Adh4 is expressed at high levels in liver and is detectable in small intestine and testes. Adh6b is expressed in liver but Adh6a is not. Adh6a is expressed at high levels in small intestine while Adh6b is not. Adh6a expression is detectable in the female adrenal and not at all in the male adrenal, but Adh6b is expressed at moderate levels in both sexes. Although Adh6a and Adh6b have expression patterns different from each other, neither expresses like any other gene in the complex, suggesting different control mechanisms and possibly different functions.",M1
18793820,"Role of electrostatics on membrane binding, aggregation and destabilization induced by NAD(P)H dehydrogenases. Implication in membrane fusion.Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is considered a classical glycolytic protein that can promote the fusion of phospholipid vesicles and can also play a vital role on in vivo fusogenic events. However, it is not clear how this redox enzyme, which lack conserved structural or sequence motifs related to membrane fusion, catalyze this process. In order to detect if this ability is present in other NAD(P)H dehydrogenases with available structure, spectroscopic studies were performed to evaluate the capability of alcohol dehydrogenase (<e>ADH</e>), glutamic dehydrogenase (GDH) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) to bind, aggregate, destabilize and fuse vesicles. Based on finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations (FDPB) the protein-membrane interactions were analyzed. A model for the protein-membrane complex in its minimum free energy of interaction was obtained for each protein and the amino acids involved in the binding processes were suggested. A previously undescribed relationship between membrane destabilization and crevices with high electropositive potential on the protein surface was proposed. The putative implication of the non-specific electrostatics on NAD(P)H dehydrogenases induced membrane fusion is discussed.",M1
18782342,"The association of <e>ADH</e> and ALDH gene variants with alcohol drinking habits and cardiovascular disease risk factors.BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in ethanol metabolism may have an influence on both alcohol drinking habits and the susceptibility to health effects of alcohol drinking. Such influences are likely to bias exposure-disease associations in epidemiologic studies of health effects of alcohol drinking. In a Caucasian population, we examined the association of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genetic variants with alcohol drinking habits, biomarkers of alcohol exposure, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The study population consisted of 1,216 Danish men and women aged 15-77 years participating in a health examination in 1998. The health examination included a self-administered questionnaire (alcohol drinking habits), a physical examination (blood pressure), and various blood tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (E-MCV), and lipids]. ADH and ALDH gene variants were determined by standard techniques. Data were analyzed by regression analyses adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Self-reported alcohol drinking was significantly associated with increasing levels of ALAT, E-MCV, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. The ALDH1b ala69val variant was associated with nondrinking and total alcohol intake. The ALDH2 promoter variant was associated with binge-drinking, and the ALDH1b1 ala69val polymorphism was associated with diastolic blood pressure. We did not find any statistically significant interactions between any of the gene variants and alcohol consumption in relation to the various outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this Caucasian population sample, we found evidence to support that genetic variation in ethanol metabolism may influence drinking habits, but no statistically significant gene-environment interactions. More large-scale epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm theses results and to further investigate genetic susceptibility to the effects of alcohol drinking.",M1

17571056,"Therapeutic options in childhood nocturnal enuresis.Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, a heterogeneous condition, is frequently treated in children aged &gt;5 years. Of the various treatment options, enuresis alarm has been widely advocated as being effective for treating nocturnal enuresis, while extracorporeal pelvic floor magnetic stimulation for overactive bladder, urge incontinence and urgency-frequency syndrome has not yet been confirmed by controlled studies as primary treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. Desmopressin, an antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) analog, or arginine vasopressin (AVP), can resolve primary nocturnal enuresis by decreasing night-time urine production. Enuretic children requiring either desmopressin or desmopressin plus oxybutynin to achieve dryness have polyuria. Tricyclic antidepressants (i.e. imipramine) are used successfully in enuretic children. Although tricyclics and desmopressin are effective in reducing the number of wet nights, most children relapse after discontinuation of active treatment. Combined therapy (enuresis alarm, bladder training, motivational therapy and pelvic floor muscle training) is more effective than each component alone or than pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, desmopressin combined with alarm therapy has a positive effect on enuresis. Pharmacotherapy can provide early relief of enuresis, while behavioral intervention may lead to greater long-term benefits. The positive effect of achieving dry nights with pharmacotherapy can encourage the child to sustain behavioral therapy.",M2

17021585,"The use of desmopressin in the management of nocturnal enuresis in patients with spinal cord injury.AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) in the management of nocturnal enuresis in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), as well as arginine vasopressin (AVP) daily production, urine output, urine osmolarity and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) before and after the use of desmopressin. METHODS: We studied 11 patients with SCI (7 men 4 women). All patients attended a rehabilitation program and used a wheelchair for locomotion. To improve bladder function and achieve socially acceptable continence all patients were placed on a regimen of anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin 5 mg, 1x3 daily), evening antibiotic prophylaxis and CIC. The subjects were also on night CIC in order to avoid nocturnal incontinence. DDAVP was given intranasally (20 mg before bedtime) in association with other standard therapy. Urine samples were collected under sterile conditions from all patients at 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Urine volume was measured and the amount of urine per hour was calculated. Blood samples were also taken to measure serum AVP, urea, creatinine and serum electrolyte. RESULTS: Our data suggest that nocturnal polyuria in SCI patients occurs due to a lack of diurnal variation of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) secretion. The use of desmopressin produced a statistically significant increase in urine production rate during the day (56.2 vs 81.2 mL/h, P&lt;0.001) and a decrease in nocturnal urine production (59.2 vs 27.7 mL/h, P&lt;0.001). Desmopressin treatment reflects also on urine osmolarity, which did not change during the day (496 vs 489 mOsm/mL, P&gt;0.5) but showed a significant increase during the night (385 vs 862 mOsm/mL, P&lt;0.001). There was a significant decrease in night CIC. No serious adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that desmopressin administration is an beneficial treating option for patients with SCI when fluid restriction and other preventive measures are not able to control abnormal nocturnal polyuria.",M2
15772501,"Role of hypobaria in fluid balance response to hypoxia.To estimate the separate and combined effects of reduced P(B) and O2 levels on body fluid balance and regulating hormones, measurements were made during reduced PB (altitude, ALT; P(B) = 432 mm Hg, F(I(O2)) = 0.207), reduced inspired O2 concentration (normobaric hypoxia, HYX; P(B) = 614 mm Hg, F(I(O2)) = 0.142), and lowered ambient pressure without hypoxia (normoxic hypobaria HYB; P(B) = 434 mm Hg, F(I(O2)) = 0.296). Nine fit and healthy young men were exposed to these conditions for 10 h in a decompression chamber. Lake Louise AMS scores, urine collections, and blood samples were obtained every 3 h, with recovery measurements 2 h after exposure. AMS was significantly greater during ALT than HYX, as previously reported (J. Appl. Physiol. 81:1908-1910. 1996), because the combination of reduced P(B) and P(O2) over the 10 h favored fluid retention by reducing urine volume, while plasma volume (PV) remained higher than during HYX. At ALT the plasma Na+ fell significantly at 6 h, probably from dilution of extracellular fluid, and antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) was highest (p = 0.006 versus HYB). The PV, urine flow, free water clearance, and plasma renin activity (PRA) rose significantly during recovery from ALT as AMS symptoms subsided, suggesting increased intravascular fluid and reduced adrenergic tone. During HYB, the plasma aldosterone (ALDO) and K+ levels were significantly elevated, and PRA was highest and ADH lowest, without fluid retention. During HYX, fluid balance was similar to HYB, but PV and ALDO were significantly lower, and ALDO increased significantly in recovery from HYX. The fluid retention at ALT in AMS-susceptible subjects appears related to a synergistic interaction involving reduced P(B) and ADH and ALDO.",M2
15246584,"Serum cortisol as a predictive marker of the outcome in patients resuscitated after cardiopulmonary arrest.OBJECTS: To analyze the relationship between stress hormones (arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol and the outcome of patients resuscitated after cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). METHODS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled in this study. In 36 of the resuscitated cases, 27 were non-survivors and 9 survived. The survival group was defined as cases either in a persistent vegetative state, with some disability or good recovery 1 month after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The non-survival group was defined as cases who died within 1 month. RESULTS: The plasma ADH and ACTH levels and the serum cortisol levels in both the surviving and the non-surviving patients were 82.3+/-74.5 and 149.6+/-135.4 (pg/ml), 239.7+/-327.4 and 282.4+/-553.0 (pg/ml), 34.1+/-11.2 and 19.0+/-12.8 (g/ml) (mean+/-S.D., respectively). The plasma ADH and ACTH levels showed no significant difference between the two groups. The serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in survivors than in the non-survivors (P=0.029). We also used the receiving-operating characteristics (ROC) curves to evaluate the optimal cutoff value of the concentration of serum cortisol as a predictive maker of non-surviving patients. The cutoff value of 16.7 g/ml for the concentrations of serum cortisol was a 1.00 positive predictive value and a 1.00 specificity at a 0.519 negative predictive and a 0.409 sensitivity for predicting non-surviving patients. The area under the ROC curve was calculated to be 0.858 at a prevalence of 0.58. The plasma ADH levels correlated significantly and positively with the plasma ACTH levels (r=0.516, P&lt;0.0010). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the serum cortisol levels were significantly higher in survivors than in non-survivors resuscitated after CPA.",M2
12665254,"Renal responses to chronic cold exposure.The aim of this study was to assess our hypothesis that the release of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>), the renal concentrating response to ADH, or both is decreased by prolonged cold exposure. Six groups (n = 6/group) of rats were used. Three groups were exposed to cold (5 degrees C), whilethe remaining three groups were kept at room temperature (25 degrees C). It was found that urine osmolality decreased significantly and serum osmolality increased significantly during cold exposure. The ratio of water/food intake was not affected by prolonged cold exposure. However, prolonged cold exposure increased the ratio of urine output/food intake in the cold-exposed rats, indicating that more urine flow is required by the cold-exposed rats to excrete the osmotic substance at a given food intake. The difference between water intake and urine output decreased significantly in the cold-exposed rats. Thus, prolonged cold exposure increases water loss from excretion. Renal concentrating responses to 24-h dehydration and Pitressin were decreased significantly in the cold-exposed rats. Plasma ADH levels remained unchanged, but renal ADH receptor (V2 receptor) mRNA was decreased significantly in the cold-exposed rats. The results strongly support the conclusion that cold exposure increases excretive water loss, and this may be due to suppression of renal V2 receptors rather than inhibition of ADH release.",M2

9871489,"Antidiuretic hormone infusion reduces taurine and NaCl-induced hypernatremia in the rat.Rats drinking taurine and hypertonic saline (T + S) develop severe hypernatremia, but rats drinking either T or S alone do not. One hypothesis for this disruption of homeostasis is that the T + S combination interferes with the actions of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>). Rats drinking T + S developed severe hypernatremia (170 mmol/L) by day 8 when infused with distilled water by osmotic minipumps, but maintained plasma sodium below 150 mmol/L when infused with ADH. Cumulative water balance in T + S drinkers receiving ADH was consistently higher than in those not receiving ADH. However the ratio of cumulative sodium balance to cumulative water balance suggests little uniform advantage to rats receiving ADH nor does comparison of urine osmolality in the two groups. Precisely how ADH administration reduces hypernatremia in T + S drinking rats remains unclear, but the hypothesis that T + S interferes with the action of ADH in its regulation of extracellular fluid volume and osmolality remains viable.",M2
8853830,"Effect of acute exposure to hypoxia on electrolytes and water metabolism regulatory hormones.BACKGROUND: Many studies suggest the hypothesis that the pathology of high altitude could be due to an early alteration of the hormones that regulate sodium homeostasis. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of these hormones during an acute exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. METHODS: We studied 26 young healthy pilot students (23.1 +/- 2.9 yrs) in a hypobaric chamber, for 3 h (samples collected at time 0, 120, and 180 min), at 5000 m ASL. RESULTS: The results show an early increase of plasma renin activity (PRA) paradoxically associated to a decrease of aldosterone plasma levels. This later returned to the baseline values at 180 min, whereas PRA remained increased throughout the exposure. Both arginine-vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) and the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) significantly increased, while a new putative hormone, the so-called digoxin-like substance (DLS) did not show significant changes.

The relationship with results previously reported is also addressed.",M2
7711446,"Participation of the kidney in the kinetics of arginine vasopressin in the water-loaded rat.The kidney is a target organ for antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) and it is also the main organ involved in the clearance of this hormone. There is controversy on the mechanisms involved in the renal handling of ADH, mainly in regard to whether it is secreted or reabsorbed. Kinetic and renal clearance studies of ADH were performed in water-loaded rats and were compared with inulin (glomerular filtration marker) and tetraethylammonium (TEA, marker of organic cation secretion). The kinetics of the three molecules fitted a bicompartmental model. Distribution constants of [125I]-ADH were twofold higher than those of inulin. Elimination constant was higher for inulin than for ADH (0.049 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.020 +/- 0.003 min-1, respectively), suggesting reabsorption of the hormone. The ratios of Clearance ADH/Clearanceinulin and ClearanceTEA/Clearanceinulin were 0.14 and 4.86, respectively. In summary, data from kinetic studies and from renal clearances suggested that ADH is reabsorbed.",M2
7475890,"Central mu opioids mediate differential control of urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion in conscious rats.Central administration of the selective mu opioid agonist, dermorphin, produces a concurrent diuretic and antinatriuretic response in conscious rats. To determine whether central mu opioids differentially affect the renal excretion of water and sodium, we examined changes in renal function produced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of dermorphin during continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of a synthetic <e>ADH</e> analogue in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. During ADH infusion the typical diuresis produced by i.c.v. dermorphin was abolished although the antinatriuresis remained intact. Alone, i.v. ADH produced a decrease in urine flow rate without significantly altering urinary sodium excretion. In other studies, the effects of i.c.v. dermorphin were examined on the renal responses produced by i.v. infusion of a V2-ADH receptor antagonist. In these studies the magnitude of the V2 antagonist-induced diuresis was not altered by i.c.v. dermorphin but the increase in urinary sodium excretion produced by this antagonist was converted to an antinatriuresis. Central dermorphin did not alter heart rate or mean arterial pressure in either study. These findings suggest that the effects of central dermorphin on renal sodium and water handling are mediated by separate mechanisms; the effects on water involving changes in circulating ADH levels and the effects on sodium independent of the action of this hormone.",M2

8023324,"Surface membrane remodeling following removal of vasopressin in toad urinary bladder.Vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) increases transepithelial water flow in renal epithelia by a process that involves the insertion of water channels into the apical membrane. The objective of the present study was to examine membrane surface remodeling under conditions that promote the recovery of water channels. Hemibladders were set up as sacs with an imposed osmotic gradient. The control sacs received no hormone treatment, whereas the other sacs were stimulated with 100 mU/ml ADH for 10 or 15 min to induce exocytosis and enhanced water flow. ADH was then washed from the tissues with fresh buffer rinses to abolish the hormone actions. These tissues were then allowed to recover for 15, 30 and 60 min. During this time water channels are recovered intracellularly by a process of endocytosis. This time period was called the retrieval period. At specified time intervals, tissues were fixed and processed for SEM or embedded in epon for ultrathin sectioning for TEM studies. Control tissues, regardless of the length of time, showed little or no sign of surface remodeling that was indicative of endocytosis during pre- or post-buffer washes, whereas the ADH-treated tissues showed a time-dependent remodeling of the apical membrane during activation and following removal of the hormone during the retrieval period. At the 10 min retrieval period, greater than 47% of the granular cells showed extensive surface remodeling. By 30 and 60 min posthormone treatment during recovery, fewer than 23% of granular cells showed signs of surface membrane changes. During retrieval the apical membrane undergoes a transition with a loss of both microridges and microvilli prior to membrane restoration. These observations suggest that apical membrane remodeling is crucial for the restoration of membrane permeability following hormone activation and termination.",M2
8170349,"Proto-oncogene c-fos and the regulation of vasopressin gene expression during dehydration.Secretion of the antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) vasopressin is increased when body fluid homeostasis is disturbed by dehydration.

The proto-oncogene c-fos codes for a nuclear phospho-protein Fos which binds to specific DNA elements and acts as a transcriptional regulator coupling short-term extracellular stimuli to long-term responses by altering secondary target gene expression. This study in rats examined the time courses of dehydration induced c-fos expression and the change of vasopressin gene expression in the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus. Immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization study demonstrated that c-fos was induced by acute intracellular dehydration in the hypothalamic magnocellular nuclei of paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and accessory groups such as nucleus circularis. Double-label immunocytochemical study co-localized Fos and vasopressin-neurophysin immunoreactivity in the same magnocellular neurons in the SON and PVN. In situ hybridization analysis after acute dehydration revealed a rapid and transient c-fos induction followed by a persistent increase in vasopressin mRNA for up to 2 days even after rehydration. Furthermore, prevention of c-fos translation by pretreatment with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide attenuated this dehydration induced increase in vasopressin mRNA. This study demonstrated that an increase in vasopressin transcription after acute dehydration is dependent on an early phase of protein synthesis.",M2

In order to precise the characteristics and the specific cellular mechanisms of this reduced hydro-osmotic response we used a sensitive volumetric technique to monitor net water flow and studied the correlation between the antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>)-induced net water flow and the fine ultrastructural appearance of the urinary bladder epithelium. Transmural net water flow was entirely dependent on the osmotic gradient across the preparation and not on the hydrostatic pressure difference. We observed the existence of a low but significant hydro-osmotic response to arginine vasopressin. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of typical aggrephores in the subapical cytoplasm. The response to the hormone was accompanied by the appearance of typical intramembrane aggregates into the apical plasma membrane. Water permeability increase and apical aggregate insertion were both slowly but fully reversible. Except for the multilayered structure of the epithelium and the particularly low response to antidiuretic hormone, all the studied permeability and ultrastructural characteristics of the bladder were thus very similar to those observed in other sensitive epithelia such as the amphibian bladder and skin and the mammalian collecting duct which exhibit a high hydro-osmotic response to the hormone.",M2

We explored whether overexpression of one of the cAMP-PDE type isozymes, PDE-IV, in [8-Arg]-vasopressin (AVP) sensitive renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells can prevent the hormone-elicited cAMP increase. LLC-PK1 cells were stably transfected with ratPDE3.1 cDNA (which encodes for rolipram-sensitive PDE-IV), inserted in plasmid pCMV5 and then were compared with sham-transfected LLC-PK1 cells and wild LLC-PK1 cells. In the stably transfected clone (LLC-PK1-S #16), the rolipram-sensitive PDE-IV activity was about five times higher than in controls, whereas activities of other types of PDEs were not different. The presence of cognate mRNA for PDE-IV was confirmed by Northern blot. Whereas in the control cells (wild LLC-PK1 cells and sham-transfected LLC-PK1 cells), the incubation with 10(-7) M AVP increased cAMP more than tenfold, the LLC-PK1-S#16 cells with overexpressed cAMP-PDE were resistant to cAMP-increasing effects of AVP and forskolin. However, in the same LLC-PK1-S#16 cells the cGMP increases in response to nitroprusside were not diminished. The AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in LLC-PK1-S#16 cells with overexpressed PDE-IV was restored by addition of roliprams which decreased cAMP-PDE activity to the levels similar to those in wild LLC-PK1 cells and sham-transfected LLC-PK1-#A1 cells. In contrast, inhibitors of other PDE isozymes (PDE-I or PDE-III) had little or no effect. Our findings show that excessive activity of cAMP-PDE, in this case of isozyme PDE-IV, can cause resistance to AVP which is analogous to that observed in collecting ducts of mice with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",M2

1329852,"Effects of high altitude exposure on plasma and urinary digoxin-like immunoreactive substance.Six young healthy subjects underwent a 20 day exposure to altitude, at 4930 m (16,174 ft), to evaluate possible plasma and urine digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (DLIS) changes accompanying the altered water and electrolyte balance induced by hypoxia. We studied DLIS, plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) in serial blood and urine samples. An increase in DLIS in plasma (P less than .005) and urine (P less than .01) was found, while aldosterone was decreased (P less than .02). PRA, ADH, and ANP did not change significantly. A trend to a greater loss of sodium through urinary excretion, correlated with urinary DLIS values (r = 0.47, P less than .01), was observed. Data suggest a possible important role of DLIS in adaptive response of human organism to high altitude.",M2
1534149,"Molecular cloning of the receptor for human antidiuretic hormone.Antidiuresis, the recovery of water from the lumen of the renal collecting tubule, is regulated by the hypothalamic release of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>), which binds to specific receptors on renal collecting tubule cells, stimulates adenylyl cyclase and promotes the cyclic AMP-mediated incorporation of water pores into the luminal surface of these cells. We report here the isolation of the human ADH receptor gene using a genomic expression cloning approach. The gene was used to clone the complementary DNA from a human renal library. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the receptor yields a hydropathy profile characteristic of receptors with seven putative transmembrane regions. This and the comparison with other cloned receptors indicates that the ADH receptor is a member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors.",M2
1451573,"Antidiuresis and natriuresis induced by gastric distension in water-loaded rats.Antidiuretic and natriuretic responses were observed following gastric distension in anesthetized, water-loaded rats. An increase of intragastric pressure to 25, 30, 35, and 40 cm H2O of 2-minute duration respectively elicited 11, 35, 45, and 55% inhibition of water diuresis with concomitant, graded increase of sodium excretion by the kidney. These antidiuretic and natriuretic responses to gastric distension persisted and sustained the same intensity after acute bilateral cervical vagotomy, indicating that the sensory input conveyed from the gastric mechanoreceptors to central nervous system during gastric distension should involve afferent fibers other than vagus nerve. Rats with diabetes insipidus (D1) produced by hypothalamic lesions were also tested, but neither antidiuresis nor natriuresis in response to gastric distension was observed in these D1 rats whose neurohypophysis contained little antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>). In conclusion, gastric distension may induce liberation of ADH and probably other neurohypophysial hormone which affects renal handling of sodium and water in anesthetized, water-loaded rats.",M2
1410435,"ANF-induced modulation of <e>ADH</e>-release in the rabbit and Pekin duck.The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) as an osmoregulatory hormone causes a reduction of extracellular fluid volume primarily through stimulation of renal and extrarenal water and sodium elimination. Consequently, ANF counteracts the renin-angio-tensin II-aldosterone (RAAS) and the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) systems at their target organ level. The possible direct interaction of ANF with the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal ADH system was investigated in conscious ducks and rabbits during conditions of eu- and dehydration. In euhydrated animals, the plasma concentration of ADH remained unchanged during the systemic infusion of species-specific ANF, whereas in dehydrated rabbits but not ducks, the plasma concentration of ADH was significantly decreased. These differences in ADH modulation were supported by the localization of binding sites for radiolabeled ANF at the sites of ADH release, the median eminence (ME) and neurohypophysis (NH) of the rabbit but not duck brain, using receptor-autoradiography. For both species, circumventricular organs lacking a functional blood-brain barrier (BBB) such as the subfornical organ (SFO), the organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (OVLT), the pineal and the choroid plexus (ChP), as well as the ependymal lining of the third ventricle (VIII) were labeled specifically. Within the BBB, binding sites for ANF could not be detected in the ADH-synthesizing paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of either species, however, sites were observed in the anterior median nucleus of the hypothalamus (AM) of the duck brain. In the AM as well as the PVN and ME, the existence of a brain-intrinsic ANF system could be demonstrated for the Pekin duck using immunocytochemistry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

Osmotic water movement across toad isolated hemibladders was measured by a gravimetric method. 2. The influence of carbamazepine, chlorpropamide and demeclocycline on the antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>)-induced water flow rate was examined. 3. No antidiuretic activity due to carbamazepine alone was observed but a slight inhibition due to ADH-induced water flow was observed in the presence of carbamazepine over a selected dose-range. This was unexpected and is inconsistent with data from in vivo studies in man. 4. Chlorpropamide potentiated ADH-induced water flow, in keeping with the hypothesis that chlorpropamide sensitizes the renal tubules to ADH-induced water flow. 5. Demeclocycline inhibited ADH-induced water flow. The mechanism of action remains unclear.",M2
1787644,"TMB-8 prevents the hydroosmotic response to <e>ADH</e> in rabbit cortical collecting tubules.Both AVP and dDAVP effect a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium (iCa2+) in cortical collecting tubule (CCT) cells. To investigate the physiological role of this increase in iCa2+, we examined the effect of TMB-8, a putative inhibitor of iCa2+ release, on the initial and sustained phase of AVP- and dDAVP-stimulated water permeability (Pf) in isolated, perfused CCTs. Pretreatment of tubules with TMB-8, 50 microM, suppressed the increase in osmotic water permeability (Pf) induced by 10 microU/ml AVP and dDAVP, but had no effect on the sustained phase of the response. When increased to 100 microM. TMB-8 inhibited the sustained phase of AVP action. A similar pattern was observed on AVP-stimulated adenyly cyclase activity in rabbit renal membranes. Pretreatment of tubules with 50 microM TMB-8 attenuated the initial increase in Pf in response to cholera toxin but not to 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin. There was no effect of this concentration of TMB-8 on the sustained phase of these agonists. These studies suggest that, in lower concentrations, TMB-8 inhibits the mobilization of iCa2+, which is important for the interaction of Gs with the catalytic unit of adenylyl cyclase and the initial increase in AVP-stimulated Pf. In higher concentrations, TMB-8 inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity directly.",M2
1832462,"Up-regulation of renal adenylate cyclase-coupled vasopressin receptors after chronic administration of vasopressin antagonists to rats.Chronic administration of vasopressin [antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>)] antagonists has been shown to produce a paradoxical antidiuresis in both ADH-replete and ADH-deplete (diabetes insipidus) rats. The antidiuretic effect is progressive, reaching maximal levels in 4 to 5 days, and sustained, persisting for at least 24 hr after cessation of treatment. The antidiuretic profiles associated with these antagonists do not coincide with the profiles of potent ADH agonists, arginine vasopressin and 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. To investigate the mechanism of the antidiuretic effect of ADH antagonists, male diabetes insipidus rats were administered antagonists selective for the renal [adenylate cyclase-coupled (V2)] or pressor (phosphytidyl inositol-coupled) vasopressin receptor and urine output (volume and osmolality) and renal vasopressin receptor properties (concentration and affinity) were determined and compared to rats treated with arginine vasopressin or 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. After acute administration, only the V2-acting antagonists were antidiuretic, but were 3 orders of magnitude less potent than 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. Following chronic administration, all of the antagonists were antidiuretic, but the level of antidiuresis achieved with the phosphytidyl inositol-coupled vasopressin receptor-selective antagonist was 2- to 3-fold lower than for analogs with V2 activity. Maximal antidiuretic effects were realized in 5 days and were apparent at 24 hr after cessation of treatment. The antidiuretic activities and potencies of the ADH antagonists appeared to be increased following chronic antagonist administration. Finally, renal vasopressin receptor concentration was significantly elevated 24 hr after cessation of antagonist treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
1647518,"Antidiuretic hormone acts via V1 receptors on intracellular calcium in the isolated perfused rabbit cortical thick ascending limb.The effect of antidiuretic hormone [( Arg]vasopressin, <e>ADH</e>) on intracellular calcium activity [Ca2+]i of isolated perfused rabbit cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL) segments was investigated with the calcium fluorescent dye fura-2. The fluorescence emission ratio at 500-530 nm (R) was monitored as a measure of [Ca2+]i after excitation at 335 nm and 380 nm. In addition the transepithelial potential difference (PDte) and transepithelial resistance (Rte) of the tubule were measured simultaneously. After addition of ADH (1-4 nmol/l) to the basolateral side of the cTAL R increased rapidly, but transiently, from 0.84 +/- 0.05 to 1.36 +/- 0.08 (n = 46). Subsequently, within 7-12 min R fell to control values even in the continued presence of ADH. The increase in R evoked by the ADH application corresponded to a rise of [Ca2+]i from a basal level of 155 +/- 23 nmol/l [Ca2+]i up to 429 +/- 53 nmol/l [Ca2+]i at the peak of the transient, as estimated by intra- or extracellular calibration procedures. The electrical parameters (PDte and Rte) of the tubules were not changed by ADH. The ADH-induced Ca2+ transient was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ on the basolateral side, whereas luminal Ca2+ had no effect. d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]2,Arg8vasopressin, a V1 antagonist (Manning compound, 10 nmol/l), blocked the ADH effect on [Ca2+]i completely (n = 5). The V2 agonist 1-desamino-[D-Arg8]vasopressin (10 nmol/l, n = 4), and the cAMP analogues, dibutyryl-cAMP (400 mumol/l, n = 4), 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (100 mumol/l, n = 1) or 8-bromo-cAMP (200 mumol/l, n = 4) had no influence on [Ca2+]i. The ADH-induced [Ca2+]i increase was not sensitive to the calcium-channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil (100 mumol/l, n = 4). We conclude that ADH acts via V1 receptors to increase cytosolic calcium activity transiently in rabbit cortical thick ascending limb segments, possibly by an initial Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and by further Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels in the basolateral membrane. These channels are insensitive to L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, e.g. nifedipine and verapamil.",M2

In a 3-year-old girl with status asthmaticus who developed a grand mal seizure in association with hyponatremia, urinary AVP levels remained high and fluctuated before convulsion; the cause of the convulsion was considered to be water intoxication due to inappropriate ADH secretion. In 19 of 28 patients with moderately severe asthmatic attacks, increases in urinary AVP levels occurred before treatment (300 +/- 80 pg/ml vs. 40 +/- 24 pg/ml (normal controls), p less than 0.01); elevated AVP levels tended to fall in response to intravenous fluid therapy (appropriate ADH secretion) in 2 of 6 patients, but did not fall (inappropriate ADH secretion) in the remaining patients. It is concluded that inappropriate ADH secretion may occur in asthmatic attacks, and that in such a condition there seems to be a potential risk of water intoxication during fluid therapy, as demonstrated in the present patient.",M2
2500029,"Effects of AVP and dDAVP on PGE2 synthesis in superfused cortical collecting tubules.Whereas interactions between antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) and prostaglandins (PGs) have been reported in the cortical collecting tubule (CCD), the precise effects of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and its analogue, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) on PGE2 synthesis remain controversial. We examined the dynamic response of PGE2 synthesis to these two analogues in isolated rabbit CCD. Microdissected CCD were superfused, and basal and hormone-induced PGE2 synthesis were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Addition of arachidonic acid (AA) steeply increased basal PGE2 synthesis, in the 0-1 microM-dose range. The presence of AA was necessary to obtain a stimulatory effect of AVP on PGE2 synthesis. AVP induced an immediate, transitory, and dose-dependent stimulation of PGE2 synthesis. A maximal effect was obtained at 10(-8) M; PGE2 synthesis was increased by approximately 150-200% over the basal synthesis. With dDAVP, a very weak response was obtained only at 10(-7) M. From these results, we conclude that PGE2 synthesis in CCD is stimulated by ADH. This effect of ADH does not depend on the V2-receptor pathway and suggests the presence of V1-receptors in CCD.",M2

The experimental results suggested that changes in the intrarenal osmotic gradients, as well as in the aggregate state of the ADH receptors as a result of the decreased ADH blood level under hypogravitation, might be a cause of the inadequate response to ADH in cosmonauts during readaptation to the Earth's gravity.",M2

The hypothesis of direct phosphorylation of the purified amiloride-blockable epithelial Na+ channel protein by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A after ADH treatment of cultured cells was investigated in this study. Phosphate-depleted A6 cells (a cell line derived from toad kidney) were exposed to 32PO4(3-) in the absence or presence of basolateral ADH (100 milliunits/ml). After 20 min (the time needed for ADH to increase maximally Na+ transport), the Na+ channels were extracted from the cells and purified. At every stage of purification, only one subunit of the Na+ channel, namely, the 315-kDa subunit, was specifically phosphorylated as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or scintillation counting. In addition, a polyclonal antibody raised against purified epithelial Na+ channel protein was able to immunoprecipitate the phosphorylated channel protein from a detergent-solubilized fraction of vasopressin-treated A6 cells. This same subunit was also specifically phosphorylated in vitro when the purified Na+ channel protein was incubated with gamma-[32P]ATP and the purified catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Thus, only a single component, the 315-kDa subunit, of the Na+ channel protein complex (which is composed of six subunits) can be phosphorylated both in vivo and in vitro. This subunit is selectively phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a level of 2-3 mol of 32P/mol of protein.",M2
2841870,"cAMP-binding proteins in medullary tubules from rat kidney: effect of <e>ADH</e>.Little is known of the regulatory steps in the cellular action of vasopressin (AVP) on the renal epithelium, subsequent to the cAMP generation. We studied cAMP-binding proteins in the medullary collecting tubule (MCT) and the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (MTAL) microdissected from the rat kidney by use of photoaffinity labeling. Microdissected tubules were homogenized and photoaffinity labeled by incubation with 1 microM 32P-labeled 8-azido-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (N3-8-[32P]-cAMP); the incorporated 32P was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Both in MCT and MTAL preparations, the analyses showed incorporation of N3-8-[32P]cAMP into two bands (Mr = 49,000 and Mr = 55,000) that comigrated with standards of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunits RI and RII. In MCT, most of the 32P (80%) was incorporated into RI, whereas in MTAL the 32P incorporated into RI and RII was equivalent. When freshly dissected MCT segments were incubated with 10(-12)-10(-6) M AVP, the subsequent photoaffinity labeling of RI with N3-8-[32P]cAMP was markedly diminished in a dose-dependent manner compared with controls. Our results suggest that cAMP binds in MCT and MTAL to regulatory subunits RI and RII of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. However, in MCT the dominant type of cAMP-dependent protein kinase appears to be type I. The outlined procedure is suitable to indirectly measure the occupancy of RI by endogenous cAMP generated in MCT cells in response to physiological levels (10(-12) M) of AVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

In order to study possible involvement of ovarian steroids in this mechanism, their effect on cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response to arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined utilizing rat and human renal medullary cells in monolayer culture. In both rat and human cells, estradiol significantly reduced cAMP response to AVP; estradiol at 1.84 x 10(-8) M, 1.84 x 10(-7) M and 1.84 x 10(-6) M decreased cAMP production stimulated by 10(-8) M AVP to 78 +/- 5%, 67 +/- 2% (P less than 0.05) and 52 +/- 1% (P less than 0.001) of the control in rat renal cells, respectively, and in human renal cells the effect of estradiol was comparable to that in rat cells.

2964643,"The effect of angiotensin II and <e>ADH</e> on the secretion of atrial natriuretic factor.Studies in intact animals have suggested that angiotensin II (AII) and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increase the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). The purpose of these studies was to examine the effects of AII and ADH on ANF secretion in a rat heart-lung preparation under conditions where aortic pressure could be regulated and other indirect effects of these hormones eliminated. ANF secretion was estimated as the total amount of ANF present in a perfusion reservoir at the end of each 30-min period. A pump was used to deliver a fluorocarbon perfusate to the right atrium at rates of either 2 or 5 ml/min. In a time control series where venous return was maintained at 2 ml/min for three 30-min periods ANF secretion was 672 +/- 114, 794 +/- 91, and 793 +/- 125 pg/min (n = 6, P greater than 0.05). When venous return was increased from 2 to 5 ml/min ANF secretion increased from 669 +/- 81 to 1089 +/- 127 pg/min (P less than 0.01). The addition of AII to the perfusate in concentrations of 50, 100, or 200 pg/ml (n = 6 in each group) had no significant effect on basal ANF secretion or the ANF response to increasing venous return. Similarly, the addition of ADH to the perfusate in concentrations of 5, 25, or 100 pg/ml had no significant effect on ANF release from the heart. These results suggest that the ability of AII and ADH to increase plasma ANF concentration in vivo may be due to the effects of these hormones on right or left atrial pressure.",M2
2894873,"Effect of dopamine antagonists on the urine flow of rats infused with hypotonic saline.1. The probable involvement of dopamine in the regulation of water excretion was investigated by administering dopamine antagonists intravenously to barbiturate--anaesthetized rats undergoing a water diuresis induced by the infusion of 0.83% glucose with 0.3% NaCl at the rate of 9 ml h-1. 2. Administration of 100 micrograms of the D1-/D2-dopamine antagonist, haloperidol, reduced the enhanced urine flow of rats infused with the hypotonic solution by 69% (from 75.4 +/- 13.0 to 23.6 +/- 6.0 microliter min-1, P less than 0.01). Similarly, the D1-receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, reduced urine flow by 58% (from 77.5 +/- 9.2 to 32.7 +/- 7.2 microliters min-1, P less than 0.01) and the D2-receptor antagonist, sulpiride, by 47% (from 66.2 +/- 8.6 to 35.1 +/- 6.8 microliter min-1, P less than 0.05). 3. The injection of SCH 23390 increased the urine osmolality from 189.6 +/- 27.5 to 479.8 +/- 45.8 mosm kg-1 (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in sodium and potassium excretion in any of the experiments.

3323602,"Captopril inhibits the hydroosmotic effect of <e>ADH</e> in the cortical collecting tubule.Previous studies have shown that captopril (CP) inhibits ADH-stimulated osmotic water permeability (Pf) in the toad bladder by potentiating endogenous bradykinin (BK). The present studies examine the effect of CP on ADH-stimulated Pf in isolated, perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT). CP (10(-4) M) reversibly inhibited Pf, stimulated by maximal concentrations of ADH (10 microU/ml). Pretreatment of CCT's with 5 microM indomethacin, however, abolished the effect of CP. Inhibition of BK production by the kallikrein inhibitors, aprotinin and benzamidine, failed to enhance Pf stimulated by submaximal concentrations of ADH (2.5 microU/ml). Since ADH exerts its effects by activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), further experiments were performed to identify the site at which CP inhibits this cascade. CP significantly inhibited forskolin (10(-4) M) stimulated Pf; however, it had no effect on cyclic AMP (10(-5) M) stimulated Pf, suggesting that the site of action is on the catalytic subunit or one of the GTP regulatory proteins of AC. To further localize the site of CP's action, CCT's were pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram/ml) to inactivate the inhibitory, guanosine triphosphate (GTP) regulatory protein, Gi. In these tubules, CP failed to inhibit the action of ADH. We conclude that CP stimulates prostaglandin production which in turn activates Gi and inhibits AC activity. We further suggest that CP stimulates PG's directly, not via BK.",M2
3322820,"Water excretion in the elderly.Osmoreceptor sensitivity is enhanced in healthy elderly subjects and AVP secretion is increased, relative to that of younger subjects, when plasma osmolality rises. Increased AVP secretion/unit increase in plasma tonicity reflects a decrease in collecting tubule sensitivity to AVP by an as yet unknown mechanism in the aged kidney. This change in sensitivity is not completely offset by increased <e>ADH</e> release, so that maximum Uosm achievable under hydropenic conditions (concentrating ability) is reduced in the elderly. CH2O in older subjects decreases in proportion to the fall in GFR; thus, CH2O is intact in older subjects with preserved GFR. In subjects with age-related reductions in GFR, minimal Uosm achievable is usually less than 100 mOsm per kg H2O and thus usually sufficient to meet the demands of solute-free water intake so that plasma hypo-osmolarity does not result. Increasing exposure of the elderly to pharmacologic agents that reduce CH2O is primarily responsible for the impression that aged patients are at increased risk for hyponatremia.",M2
2453174,"Effect of reagents of protein functional groups on the <e>ADH</e>-induced urea facilitated transport across toad urinary bladder.1--The mechanism of the vasopressin-induced, facilitated transport across toad urinary bladder was studied by treating the luminal membrane of the epithelium with the following reagents of protein functional groups: NEM (SH groups), SITS (amino groups), EEDQ (carboxylic groups), DEPC (histidine). 2--Treatment of the luminal side of the epithelium by NEM strongly inhibits the ADH-induced urea transport, leaving unmodified the effect of the hormone on the flux of antipyrine, a lipid soluble molecule. These results confirm the hypothesis that the urea carrier is of proteic nature. 3--Treatment of the luminal side by SITS strongly inhibits ADH action on urea and antipyrine permeability; thus this effect can be considered rather unspecific. 4--On the contrary the EEDQ effect is more specific; in fact treatment of the luminal side by EEDQ strongly inhibits ADH effect on the permeability of urea, slightly increasing the ADH effect on that of antipyrine. 5--Finally, the luminal treatment by diethylpyrocarbonate inhibits almost completely the ADH action on the urea fluxes, slightly increasing the hormone effect on the antipyrine ones. 6--Based on these results we conclude that carboxylic groups and the imidazolic ring are more important than the amino groups in determining the urea transport across toad bladder, in the presence of ADH.",M2
3038297,"Hyponatremia in small cell lung cancer. Mechanisms not involving inappropriate <e>ADH</e> secretion.A 62-year-old man with small cell carcinoma (oat cell type) of the lung who had hyponatremia and renal sodium loss with inappropriate antidiuresis is reported. Plasma levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) were not elevated inappropriately. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), however, were high, and increased after water loading and hypertonic saline infusion. The renin-aldosterone axis was normal, as were adrenal, thyroid, and renal functions. Water restriction to 500 to 700 ml/d resulted in a rise in serum sodium. Analysis of the tumor tissue failed to demonstrate the presence of AVP or ANP. The findings (1) suggest that hyponatremia and renal sodium loss with inappropriate antidiuresis observed in the patient is due to an antidiuretic substance distinct from AVP, and (2) point to the possibility that hypersecretion of ANP may play a role in the pathophysiology.",M2
2440315,"Potassium transport in cortical collecting tubules from mineralocorticoid-treated rat.Unidirectional fluxes of 86Rb+ were used to examine the stimulation of K+ secretion produced by arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) in isolated perfused cortical collecting tubules from rats treated with desoxycorticosterone. ADH at 100 microU/ml in the bathing solution increased the bath-to-lumen flux (Jb----l; pmol X min-1 X mm-1) from 16.9 +/- 2.3 to 43.2 +/- 4.6 (n = 16). The lumen-to-bath flux (Jl----b) fell from 3.2 +/- 0.7 to 1.3 +/- 0.4 with ADH due to hyperpolarization of the transepithelial voltage from -12.6 +/- 1.3 to -39.3 +/- 2.0 mV, but the calculated Rb+ permeability was unaltered at 0.20-0.26 micron/s. Although 2 mM lumen Ba2+ inhibited Jb----l by 55 +/- 6%, the flux ratio (Jb----l/Jl----b) of 28 +/- 8 was larger than predicted for passive exchange. In the absence of ADH 2 mM Ba2+ reduced Jb----l to the level predicted for passive movement, but addition of ADH with Ba2+ still present increased Jb----l by an amount identical to that observed without Ba2+, although the absolute Jb----l was less. Simultaneous addition of 2 mM luminal and 4 mM bath Ba2+ also inhibited Jl----b for 22Na+ but not to passive levels. These results indicate either that the concentrations of Ba2+ used were insufficient to block K+ conductances completely or that K+/Rb+ secretion can occur through a Ba2+-insensitive pathway.",M2
3562867,"Effect of acetylsalicylic acid on urinary excretion of prostaglandin E in stroke patients.In 12 of 76 stroke patients complicated by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), a significant increase in urinary prostaglandin E (PGE) (p less than 0.005), and a significant positive relationship between the plasma arginine vasopressin (AVR) level and urinary PGE excretion were observed (r = 0.72, p less than 0.05). The experimental results are consistent with the view that renal PGE acts as a modulator of <e>ADH</e>. Nowadays acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, is widely used in ischemic stroke, it was felt necessary to study the effect of this drug on urinary PGE excretion. Therefore various daily doses of ASA were given orally for 3 days to patients with ischemic stroke. PGE values in 24-hour urine samples were measured every day for 3 days before administration of the drug and for 3 days during ASA administration. In 10 patients who took 75 mg of ASA, the decrease in urinary PGE excretion was not statistically significant. On the other hand when ASA was administered 300 mg once in 19 patients or 300 mg 4 times in 11 cases, urinary PGE excretion decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively). In another group of 8 patients who were observed before, during and after the ASA administration, a daily oral dose of 300 mg for 3 days caused a significant decrease in urinary PGE excretion during these 3 days (p less than 0.05). The urinary PGE excretion returned to the control level within 3 days after cessation of the ASA administration.",M2
3020336,"Inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone hydroosmotic response by phospholipids and phospholipid metabolites.Phospholipid metabolities and phospholipids containing arachidonic acid (AA) inhibited the antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>)-induced increase in transepithelial water flow in the toad urinary bladder, but had no effect on basal water flow when added to the serosal bathing solution. Other fatty acid-substituted phospholipid metabolites had no effect on osmotic water movement in the presence or absence of ADH. Indomethacin attenuated the inhibitory effects of the AA containing phospholipid metabolities (PMAA), suggesting that the PMAA response required AA release and prostaglandin (PG) formation. PMAA increased PGE formation as measured by radioimmunoassay. PG have been reported to inhibit ADH-stimulated water flow by inhibiting adenylcyclase. PGE2 (10(-8) M) had no effect on cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow, whereas exogenous AA and PMAA attenuated the hydroosmotic response to added cyclic AMP. Indomethacin only partially reversed the inhibition by AA of the cyclic AMP-associated water movement, suggesting that the inhibition by AA and PMAA may involve other metabolites of AA than PG. PG and the AA cascade have been implicated as cellular modulators of the ADH hydroosmotic response. The present results offer additional support to the theory that this system may regulate the intracellular events that are transduced following receptor activation by ADH.",M2
3740274,"Action of <e>ADH</e> on isolated medullary thick ascending limb of the Brattleboro rat.Establishment of a maximal corticomedullary osmotic gradient during chronic administration of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) to Brattleboro (diabetes insipidus, DI) rats is a gradual process. The effects of ADH on voltage and radioisotopic chloride efflux (lumen to bath) were investigated in medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) isolated from DI rats and perfused in vitro. Acute in vitro exposure of mTAL to ADH (250 microU/ml) significantly increased both the voltage (+3.3 +/- 0.3 to +4.5 +/- 0.5 mV) and chloride efflux (192.7 +/- 29.4 to 240.4 +/- 41.5 peq/min X mm). After chronic in vivo treatment with ADH for 10-21 days mTAL expressed substantially higher basal voltage and chloride efflux (+8.4 +/- 0.6 mV and 393.2 +/- 71.6 peq/min X mm). Acute in vitro application of ADH to mTAL from chronically treated animals induced a further small increase in voltage (22%). These results are taken to indicate that ADH may have dual effects on NaCl transport by the mTAL of the DI rat: a small rapid effect, and a larger long-term increase in transport that can be shown only after chronic administration of ADH. These effects may, in part, explain the gradual enhancement of concentrating ability observed in DI rats.",M2
3717348,"Effect of <e>ADH</e> on rubidium transport in isolated perfused rat cortical collecting tubules.Unidirectional fluxes of 86Rb+ were measured as an indicator of potassium transport in isolated rat cortical collecting tubules perfused and bathed at 38 degrees C with isotonic solutions in which Rb+ replaced K+. Under control conditions the lumen-to-bath flux (Jl----b) was significantly less than the bath-to-lumen flux (Jb----l), indicating net Rb+ secretion. Net secretion increased approximately 180% after addition of 100 microU/ml of arginine vasopressin (ADH) to the bathing solution, due to a rapid and reversible increase in Jb----l from 4.6 +/- 0.8 to 9.0 +/- 1.9 pmol X min-1 X mm-1 with no significant change in Jl----b. The ADH effect was completely inhibited by 2 mM luminal Ba2+. The average transepithelial voltage (Ve) was not significantly different from zero in the control period but became lumen negative (-5 to -10 mV) after ADH. With 10(-5) M amiloride in the lumen Ve was lumen positive (+2 to +4 mV) and was unaltered by ADH or Ba2+, yet ADH produced a significant but attentuated increase in Jb----l with no change in Jl----b. The results indicate that ADH augments net K+ secretion either by an increase in the Ba2+-sensitive conductance of the apical membrane or by an increase in the electrochemical potential driving force for net Rb+ secretion through this pathway.",M2
3714004,"Prolonged hemodynamic maintenance by the combined administration of vasopressin and epinephrine in brain death: a clinical study.The present study attempted long term hemodynamic maintenance in 16 adult brain-dead patients, 14 with head injury and 2 with cerebrovascular accidents. In addition to respiratory and fluid management, 10 were treated with continuous infusion of epinephrine to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg. The remaining 6 patients each received a continuous infusion of synthetic arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) at a rate of 1 or 2 units/hour (285 +/- 45 microunits/kg/minute) simultaneously with epinephrine. The 10 patients treated with epinephrine alone all succumbed to cardiac arrest within 48 hours of brain death, with a mean survival time of 24.1 +/- 17.2 hours. In the patients who received simultaneous ADH infusion, a minimal dose of epinephrine of no more than 0.5 mg/hr in most instances sufficed to maintain blood pressure. Their mean survival time after brain death was remarkably prolonged to 23.1 +/- 19.1 days. In brain death, ADH plays a critical role in hemodynamic maintenance, and ADH administration permits long term hemodynamic stabilization of brain-death patients, offering increasing opportunities for organ transplantation.",M2
3700653,"Inhibition by lithium of the hydroosmotic action of vasopressin in the isolated perfused cortical collecting tubule of the rabbit.Because treatment with lithium salts may impair renal concentrating ability, we investigated the possibility of a direct effect of lithium ions on the permeability to water of the collecting duct epithelium. The coefficient of hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of isolated perfused rabbit cortical collecting tubules (CCT) was measured in the presence and absence of arginine-8-vasopressin (AVP), or 8-bromo (Br) cyclic AMP (cAMP) and/or lithium chloride (Li 10 mM). In the absence of AVP, Li in the lumen for 30 min failed to affect basal water permeability; however, in tubules preincubated with Li in the lumen for 80 min, basal water permeability was reduced to 30% of the value found in control tubules (P less than 0.01). In CCT incubated at 25 degrees C with Li in the lumen for 3 h, the hydroosmotic response to 2.5 microU X ml-1 AVP (Lp = 6.88 +/- 1.54 nl X cm-2 X s-1 X atm-1) was significantly lower than that in the control tubules (13.98 +/- 1.59, P less than 0.01); the inhibition was not reversible. When Li was present in the peritubular medium only, the hydroosmotic effect of AVP was not different from that of the controls. The hydroosmotic effect of 25 microU/ml AVP was investigated at 37 degrees C. CCT exposed to Li in the lumen had a 49% inhibition of peak Lp under AVP (Lp = 10.98 +/- 1.17) as compared with control tubules (Lp = 21.39 +/- 1.51; P less than 0.005). In contrast, the hydroosmotic response to 8-Br-cAMP was not affected by lithium. The results are compatible with the view that Li inhibits the action of AVP at the level of the regulating protein or the catalytic unit of the membrane adenylate cyclase and that the site of the interaction can be reached by lithium only from the cytoplasmic side. The Li-antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) interaction found here may represent the earliest pathophysiological event underlying the renal concentrating defect observed after Li administration.",M2
3716831,"Influence of heat exposure on acid/base and fluid balance in hyperhydrated goats.Hyperhydrated goats were exposed to an environmental temperature of 45 degrees C (relative humidity 70%) for 120 min. After 90 min, rectal temperature and respiratory frequency reached plateau levels of 40.5 degrees C and 280 respirations min-1, respectively. Measurements of arterial and venous blood acid-base parameters revealed that respiratory alkalosis had started to develop after 60 min, and had become obvious at the end of the heat exposure period. Renal compensation (evidenced by gradual increases in urinary pH and renal Na excretion) developed in parallel with the respiratory alkalosis. The heat exposure elicited a moderate, temporary inhibition of the water diuresis, but no obvious increase in the renal excretion of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, <e>ADH</e>). Preliminary determinations of plasma aldosterone did not show any change during the actual heat exposure period, but a 50% temporary decrease in plasma aldosterone 30 min thereafter. The study confirms the susceptibility of goats to develop respiratory alkalosis during thermoregulatory panting, and shows that this is not to any appreciable extent diminished during hyperhydration. It can further be concluded that a heat-induced rise in body temperature to 40.5 degrees C is no powerful stimulus for vasopressin release in the hyperhydrated goat. The determinations of plasma aldosterone suggest that reduced liberation of the hormone does not contribute to the immediate renal compensation of respiratory alkalosis, but that respiratory alkalosis reaching a certain intensity inhibits aldosterone secretion.",M2
2949542,"Release of tissue kallikrein from the isolated perfused kidney.Experiments were designed to determine the action of regulatory peptides and potassium on the secretion of tissue kallikrein by the isolated perfused rat kidney. Such experiments indicated that in spite of the directly evoked release of kallikrein by arginine-vasopressin (AVP, <e>ADH</e>), oxytocin and potassium from isolated renal cortical slices, the secretion and clearance of active and total tissue kallikrein by the isolated kidney was primarily sensitive to changes in the perfusion pressure.",M2
2944140,"Influences of water deprivation and fasting on hypothalamic, pituitary and plasma opioid peptides and prolactin in rats.To study the physiological roles of endogenous opioid peptides in drinking and feeding behaviors, the effects of water deprivation and fasting on plasma immunoreactive (IR) beta-endorphin (beta-end), IR-Antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) and IR-Prolactin (Prl), pituitary IR-beta-end and IR-methionine-enkephalin (IR-Met-enk) and IR-ADH, and hypothalamic IR-beta-end and IR-Met-enk were observed in rats. The effects of water deprivation on hypothalamic dopaminergic system was also studied. In water deprived rats, plasma IR-beta-end and Prl were decreased significantly. In the neurointermediate lobe, IR-Met-enk, but not IR-beta-end, was decreased, although these peptides did not change in the anterior lobe and hypothalamus. Intraperitoneal injection of haloperidol reversed the decrease in plasma IR-beta-end in water deprived rats but did not change it in control rats. Subcutaneous injection of CB-154, on the other hand, decreased the plasma IR-beta-end in control rats but not in water deprived rats. The dopamine (DA) turnover rate in hypothalamus, in addition, was increased in water deprived rats as compared with controls. In fasted rats, IR-beta-end in plasma, but not in pituitary lobes and hypothalamus, was increased. The present results suggest that the increase of hypothalamic dopaminergic activity, in part, is related to the suppressed secretions of pituitary IR-beta-end and Prl in water deprivation, and plasma IR-beta-end play some roles in feeding behavior in rats.",M2
2430346,"Antidiuretic hormone response in the amphibian urinary bladder: time course of cytochalasin-induced vacuole formation, an ultrastructural study employing ruthenium red.Cytochalasin is known to inhibit the antidiuretic hormone-induced hydro-osmotic response (bulk water flow) in the amphibian urinary bladder without altering hormone-stimulated diffusional water permeability or short-circuit current. In addition, histological studies have shown that the mold metabolite induces the formation of large intracellular vacuoles or lakes in the epithelial cells. We report here a transmission electron microscopic time-course study which indicates that during the early phases of the <e>ADH</e> response cytochalasin causes the formation of numerous multivesicular bodies or aggregates derived from individual basolateral pinocytotic vesicles. Because of their apparent hypertonic nature, the vesicles, as well as the vesicular aggregates, accumulate water during hormone-stimulated hydro-osmotic flow. As a result, the multivesicular bodies dilate and fuse to form the large intracellular lakes characteristic of cytochalasin treatment in the presence of both an applied osmotic gradient and vasopressin. In the presence of mucosal ruthenium red, the luminal glycocalyx was heavily stained with this tracer. At no time, however, even in the presence of hormone, was there any evidence for the uptake of this dye at the apical epithelial border. In the presence of serosal ruthenium red, the lateral intercellular spaces, basolateral pinocytotic vesicles, basal lamina, and collagen, as well as other subepithelial structures, were ruthenium positive. With cytochalasin D, vasopressin, and serosal ruthenium red, both the pinocytotic vesicles and the multivesicular bodies demonstrated an apparent membrane associated ruthenium positive coat. The tracer data indicates that the basolateral pinocytotic vesicles, increased by the presence of hormone, are indeed endocytotic in nature. The mucopolysaccharide coat associated with these structures may be involved in ionic and/or fluid transport.",M2
2412453,"Forskolin and antidiuretic hormone stimulate a Ca2+-activated K+ channel in cultured kidney cells.Single channels in the apical cell membrane of primary cultured chick kidney cells were studied using the patch clamp technique. Cell-attached recordings revealed the presence of a 107 +/- 6 pS channel that increased fractional open time upon depolarization. Experiments with inside-out excised patches indicated that the channel is K+ selective, Ca2+ activated, and inhibited by Ba2+. The addition of forskolin or antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) to the bath during cell-attached recordings caused an increase in the fractional open time of the channel. The activation of a K+ channel by increases in cAMP may be one way in which K+ secretion in the kidney is stimulated by ADH in vivo.",M2
4025556,"Effects of dDAVP on rat juxtamedullary nephrons: stimulation of medullary K recycling.The effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) on the handling of water and electrolytes by the juxtamedullary nephrons were studied on rats with reduced circulating levels of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>), parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and glucagon, all of which stimulate the adenylate cyclase system of the thick ascending limb and the distal tubule. In such hormone-deprived rats and in hormone-deprived + dDAVP rats, the concentration of Na, Cl, and total solutes was lower in the ascending than in the descending limbs, whereas the inulin concentration was similar at both sites. dDAVP did not alter the fraction of NaCl remaining in the thin limbs, but tended to reduce that of Mg and Ca. On the other hand, dDAVP significantly increased the fraction of filtered K remaining from 65.8 +/- 5.2 to 107.3 +/- 15.8%. A direct correlation was observed between the fraction of filtered K remaining at the tip of the juxtamedullary loops and the fractional excretion rate of K in urine. Since dDAVP enhances distal K net secretion, as previously shown in our laboratory, these results indicate that the medullary recycling of K from nephron terminal segments to Henle's loop of juxtamedullary nephrons is stimulated by this peptide.",M2
4027571,"Lesions of the tissue surrounding the preoptic recess (AV3V region) affect neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nuclei in the rat.Lesions of the tissue surrounding the preoptic recess (AV3V region) have severe effects on body fluid homeostasis; these include acute adipsia and failure of the antidiuretic response. Because neurosecretory cells in supraoptic nuclei comprise the major source of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) in this species, we have previously observed the fine structure of supraoptic nuclei in rats with AV3V lesions. Paraventricular nuclei are the other major source of ADH in rats. Therefore, in this investigation we compared the fine structure of paraventricular nuclei in rats which had received AV3V lesions 3 days earlier with that of control rats which had received sham lesions and either had drinking water available or had water withheld for 3 days. Degenerating axons and axon terminals were present in paraventricular nuclei of lesioned rats. The degenerating terminals were in axodendritic and less often in axosomatic synapses. Morphometric evaluation revealed that neurosecretory cells did respond to the dehydrated state of the adipsic-lesioned animals, but the response was significantly attenuated compared to that which occurred in sham-lesioned rats deprived of water for 3 days. It appears that AV3V lesions damage afferent connections and impair the response of neurosecretory cells to dehydration in paraventricular as well as supraoptic nuclei. However, in paraventricular nuclei the response is not completely prevented by AV3V lesions during the adipsic period as was observed in supraoptic nuclei. The presence of a response in paraventricular nuclei may be at least partially stimulated by reduced body fluid volume. Information from volume receptors would be carried from the medulla to paraventricular nuclei by ascending pathways which are not affected by AV3V lesions.",M2

2412806,"Rat renal cell monolayer culture: a sensitive method for investigating <e>ADH</e> and PTH actions on the kidney by determining adenosine 3' :5'-cyclic monophosphate.The response of cAMP to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was studied using rat renal medullary cells in a monolayer culture. In addition, cAMP response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) was studied in renal cortical cells. As the culture aged, an increase in basal cAMP content and a gradual decrease in the cAMP responsiveness to arginine vasopressin (AVP) were observed. After 2 days of culture, AVP and hPTH-(1-34) produced a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP with single peaks, after 10 min and 5 min, respectively. Extracellular cAMP was increased linearly by both AVP and hPTH-(1-34). The response of cAMP to AVP was markedly greater in the medulla than in the cortex, while the response to hPTH-(1-34) was remarkable only in the cortex. Outstanding sensitivity of cAMP responsiveness was observed in this system, i.e., 10(-12) M AVP (1 pg/ml) and 2.43 X 10(-10) M hPTH-(1-34) (1 ng/ml) provoked significant increases in cAMP from the basal level of 0.31 +/- 0.04 and 0.59 +/- 0.05 pmol/dish to 0.79 +/- 0.03 and 1.07 +/- 0.13 pmol/dish, respectively (P less than 0.001).

3920247,"Roles of Ca2+ and Na+ on the modulation of antidiuretic hormone action on urea permeability in toad urinary bladder.The present studies probe the role of Ca2+ and Na+ in the stimulation-permeability coupling sequences by which antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) induces a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated increase in urea permeability in toad urinary bladder. The following results were obtained: (a) Removal of mucosal Na+ or Ca2+ or deletion of serosal Ca2+ did not modify ADH action. (b) Reduction of the serosal Na+ concentration to less than 50 mM inhibited the effects of both ADH and cAMP. The minimal concentration of serosal Na+ needed for the hormone to elicit its maximal effect was reduced to approximately 10 mM if serosal Ca2+ was concomitantly deleted. (c) The Na+ ionophore monensin produced an inhibition of ADH and cAMP actions that was dependent on the presence of Na+ and Ca2+ in the serosa. (d) The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 produced a serosal Ca2+-dependent inhibition of ADH effect and did not modify cAMP action. (e) Carbachol, which increases Ca2+ uptake to the same extent that A23187 does, had no effect on ADH action. (f) Quinidine, which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, produced a large inhibition of the action of ADH but not that of cAMP; the inhibition was greatly reduced if serosal Ca2+ was deleted. (g) Dinitrophenol and iodoacetate, which also release Ca2+ from intracellular pools, had no effect on ADH action. (h) The Ca2+ channel blocker diltiazem had no effect on ADH action and did not modify the inhibitions produced by deletion of serosal Na+ or monensin. (i) The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin partially removed the inhibition produced by deletion of serosal Na+ and almost completely impeded the inhibitions produced by either monensin or A23187. It is concluded: (a) Extracellular Ca2+, Na+ transport rates, and serosal Na+, in concentrations between 10 and 110 mM, have no participation in modulating the increase in urea permeability produced by ADH. (b) Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ activity, which are capable of inhibiting the effect of ADH on urea permeability at pre- and/or post-cAMP steps, seem to be highly compartmentalized. (c) Endogenous prostaglandins might play a role in the inhibitions produced by absence of serosal Na+, monensin, or A23187.",M2

The latter material is a specific fluorescent label for F actin. In the presence of an osmotic gradient, both ADH and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) appear to induce the polymerization of monomeric actin into F actin-containing microfilaments.

2860030,"Plasma arginine vasopressin response to water load during labor.To find out whether plasma vasopressin (PAVP) response to a water load during pregnancy is inappropriately high, as had been speculated, we measured PAVP by radioimmunoassay in 30 women at the time of delivery. Ten women had received infusion of aqueous glucose solution during labor for hydration (GW group); another ten received infusion of glucose solution as a vehicle for oxytocin (OT group), and ten women did not receive any intrapartum intravenous fluid therapy (controls). Serum sodium and osmolality were also determined in all the subjects. PAVP levels were significantly lower in GW (0.70 +/- 0.4 pg/ml) and OT groups (0.7 +/- 0.6 pg/ml) (P less than 0.05). Significant negative correlation was seen between the amount of glucose solution infused and levels of PAVP (r = -0.66; P less than 0.01), while a significant positive correlation was seen between PAVP and serum sodium (r = 0.61; P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that during labor, the physiological relationship between serum osmolality and PAVP is intact, and that infusion of a water load in the form of aqueous glucose solution is attended by an expected lowering of PAVP. We infer that inappropriate <e>ADH</e> response is not the cause of water retention and hyponatremia often seen in women receiving aqueous glucose solution during labor.",M2
3922622,"Fusion images and intramembrane particle aggregates during the action of antidiuretic hormone. A rapid-freeze study.Antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) causes the appearance of water-conducting particle aggregates in the luminal membrane of receptor cells in amphibian bladder and skin, and in the mammalian collecting duct. The aggregates originate from cytoplasmic tubules that fuse with the luminal membrane during ADH stimulation. We have studied the process of fusion and the structure of the particle aggregates by a rapid-freeze technique that renders chemical fixation and glycerol protection unnecessary. Our findings differ in some important respects from previously published work. Aggregate particles, in our study, partition equally between the external (EF) and protoplasmic (PF) membrane leaflets, rather than remaining in the protoplasmic leaflet exclusively. By including the entire population of fusion images in our survey, we have found that aggregate delivery in ADH-treated cells proceeds preferentially from small fusion images whose diameter is significantly less than the 0.12 micron characteristic of the carrier tubules themselves. We have also found that, even in unstimulated preparations, fusion images are numerous, being mostly of small diameter. ADH stimulation produces a moderate increase in the number of fusion images and a significant increase in fusion-image diameter. These findings indicate that the individual particles are mobile within the membrane, lacking interparticle linkage. In addition, contact of cytoplasmic tubules with the luminal membrane may take place even in the absence of ADH, producing small fusion images which are not associated with aggregate delivery to the luminal membrane.",M2
3841034,"Evidence against a vasopressor role of <e>ADH</e> in malignant DOC-salt hypertension.To investigate the possible role of vasopressin (VP) in the maintenance of DOC-salt hypertension the effect of two VP pressor antagonists on mean arterial pressure and the pressor responsiveness to exogenous VP were studied in conscious, freely moving rats with malignant DOC-salt hypertension. Intravenous injections of either 20 micrograms/kg of dP Tyr(Me)AVP or 10 micrograms/kg of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure and heart rate, although both antagonists almost completely abolished the pressor response to VP. Furthermore, the animals with DOC-salt hypertension exhibited decreased pressor responsiveness to exogenous VP. The present findings strongly suggest that VP is not essential as a pressor hormone for maintaining blood pressure in malignant DOC-salt hypertension.",M2
6391788,"Assessment of hormonal disorders of water metabolism.Clinical disorders of water regulation are relatively common and occur with severity ranging from profound and easily recognizable disturbance of body water balance to mild and often clinically inapparent. The development of sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay procedures capable of quantitating the level of AVP in plasma and urine has allowed elucidation of the pathophysiology of many of the disorders whether due to deficiency of <e>ADH</e> secretion and action or to excessive or persistent hormone release. In turn, the understanding of the factors regulating ADH release and action has led to establishment and validation of a variety of procedures that by indirect means allow estimation of extent of hormone action. These procedures based on physiologic influences that stimulate or inhibit ADH release or action are simple, readily available, and relatively inexpensive, and are capable of making an accurate diagnosis of a water-losing or water-retaining disorder. Properly performed and interpreted, such tests as water deprivation, saline infusion, comparison of urine and serum osmolality, and water loading can obviate the need for AVP immunoassays in evaluating most clinical disorders of water regulation. The immunoassay of AVP, although a valuable tool for the study of normal and pathologic physiology of ADH, is rarely necessary to firmly establish a clinical diagnosis and may itself be the source of misleading conclusions if its limitations are not fully appreciated.",M2
6498676,"Hereditary central diabetes insipidus: plasma levels of antidiuretic hormone in a family with a possible osmoreceptor defect.A large Canadian kindred of Irish extraction extending from Quebec to British Columbia with autosomal dominant diabetes insipidus responsive to exogenous antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) is described. Out of 121 individuals 34 have been identified as affected in seven generations. The disorder is characterized by variability in age at onset and in severity, and by apparently spontaneous abatement in old age. The affected subjects do not appear to manifest hypertension or its sequelae. In three individuals tested the plasma ADH level was very low in spite of adequate osmotic stimulation. However, the level rose in two of them when they were given furosemide, which suggests an osmoreceptor defect and a normal ADH response to volume change.",M2
6097738,"Sustained response to vasopressin in isolated rat cortical collecting tubule.The effect of arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) on water permeability and transepithelial voltage was examined in cortical collecting tubules from a specific pathogen-free line of male Sprague-Dawley rats (75-125 g body weight). Tubules were bathed in a medium resembling serum ultrafiltrate (310 mOsm/kg H2O) at 38 degrees C. Osmotic water permeability (Pf, micron/sec) was determined by the volume flow occurring with a hypo-osmotic perfusate (210-220 mOsm/kg H2O) and diffusional water permeability (Pd, micron/sec) was calculated from the lumen-to-bath flux of tritiated water using an isosmotic perfusate. In the absence of ADH, both Pf and Pd were low, 17 +/- 6 and 9.0 +/- 0.6 (SEM), respectively. ADH added to the bath at concentrations above 0.5 microunits/ml increased Pf, with a maximal response at 40 microunits/ml or greater. With 100 microunits/ml ADH, Pf and Pd were, respectively, 994 +/- 117 and 37.0 +/- 2.4. Without ADH, the transepithelial voltage was variable (range, -5.4 to +2.5 mV; mean, -1.9 +/- 0.4); however, with 100 microU/ml ADH, it hyperpolarized (lumen-negative) by 4.2 +/- 0.8 mV. In contrast to findings in the rabbit, both the hyperpolarization and the increased water permeability persisted for at least 3 hr. The higher water permeabilities are consistent with the shorter length of the cortical collecting tubule in the rat, and may reflect the importance of attaining osmotic equilibration within the cortex during maximal antidiuresis.",M2
6467834,"Renal excretion of antidiuretic hormone in healthy subjects and patients with renal failure.Urinary clearance of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) has been measured under basal conditions and during intravenous administration of arginine vasopressin in ten healthy subjects, and only under basal conditions in 18 patients with chronic renal failure and seven patients with acute renal failure at the polyuric phase of the disease. In healthy subjects studied under conditions of mild water diuresis plasma concentration, urinary excretion rate, urinary clearance and fractional clearance of ADH were 3.3 +/- 0.36 pg/ml, 25.2 +/- 5.5 pg/min, 7.5 +/- 1.2 ml/min and 6.4 +/- 1.0% (means +/- SEM) respectively. When plasma ADH was raised to levels between 7 and 26 pg/ml during intravenous administration of the hormone, urinary excretion rate and urinary clearance of ADH increased. Tubular reabsorption of ADH did not reach a plateau but progressively increased in the range of plasma ADH studied. In patients with chronic renal failure, plasma concentration, urinary excretion rate, urinary clearance and fractional clearance of ADH were 2.8 +/- 0.19 pg/ml, 9.4 +/- 2.0 pg/min, 3.4 +/- 0.6 ml/min and 10.0 +/- 2.9% (means +/- SEM) respectively. Urinary excretion rate and urinary clearance were significantly lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with acute renal failure, plasma concentration, urinary excretion rate, urinary clearance and fractional clearance of ADH were 4.6 +/- 0.47 pg/ml, 52.8 +/- 15.8 pg/min, 9.5 +/- 2.7 ml/min and 24.9 +/- 4.4% (means +/- SEM) respectively. Urinary excretion rate and fractional clearance were higher than in healthy subjects and patients with chronic renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
6335414,"Circulating levels of arginine vasopressin before and during the infusion of the hormone in patients presenting with bleeding oesophageal varices.Circulating levels of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) were measured in patients presenting with bleeding oesophageal varices before and during treatment with arginine vasopressin. There was no significant difference in the circulating levels of ADH before and during treatment with arginine vasopressin in patients in which the hormone successfully controlled haemorrhage and those in which it did not. It is concluded that the failure of vasopressin to control variceal haemorrhage in approximately 40% of patients presenting for treatment cannot be attributed to higher circulating levels of the hormone in these subjects.",M2
6434791,"Evidence that renal prostaglandins are involved in renal water metabolism in cirrhosis.Plasma antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) and urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion (UPGE2V) were measured in basal conditions, after water restriction, and after water-loading in 10 normal subjects (free water clearance after the water load, CH2O, 9.6 +/- 0.8 ml/min) and in 27 patients with cirrhosis and ascites (13 with a positive CH2O: 3.6 +/- 0.5; 14 with a negative CH2O: -0.37 +/- 0.007). Plasma ADH and UPGE2V were significantly increased in patients with a positive CH2O as compared with normal subjects. Patients with a negative CH2O showed a significantly higher plasma ADH and a lower UPGE2V and GFR than did normal subjects and patients with the positive CH2O. In 18 additional subjects (6 normal and 12 with cirrhosis, ascites, and a positive CH2O) submitted to a sustained water overload, the i.v. administration of 450 mg of lysine acetylsalicylate (LAS) induced a marked reduction of UPGE2V, but it had no effect on plasma ADH. LAS did not alter GFR and CH2O in normal subjects; however, it reduced CH2O in all the 12 patients (from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 0.6 +/- 0.3) and the GFR in only 6 of these patients. These results suggest (a) that renal PGE2 plays an important role in the maintenance of water excretion in cirrhosis with ascites, and (b) that impaired ability to dilute the urine in cirrhosis may be a consequence of the simultaneous occurrence of impaired renal hemodynamics, nonostomic hypersecretion of ADH, and reduced renal production of PGE2.",M2
6742134,"Effect of long- and short-term antidiuretic hormone availability on internephron heterogeneity in the adult rat.We have previously shown that certain aspects of internephron heterogeneity are reduced or absent in Brattleboro rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus (DI) lacking <e>ADH</e> and can be restored by long-term ADH administration started before complete kidney maturation. In the present study, the effects of long- and short-term availability of ADH in adulthood were studied in Brattleboro DI rats. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), glomerular volume (GV), and proximal tubular length (PTL) were measured in superficial and juxtamedullary nephrons using the ferrocyanide and microdissection techniques. ADH administration for 6 wk in adult DI rats (group A) restored normal nephron heterogeneity of SNGFR, GV, and PTL by increasing the filtration and size of deep nephrons. Acute changes in ADH availability induced either by 1-h ADH infusion in DI rats (group C) or by ADH discontinuation for 2 days in treated DI rats (group D) did not significantly change the anatomical parameters and only moderately affected SNGFR compared with the preexisting states (groups B and A, respectively). These results suggest that the influence of ADH on internephron heterogeneity is initiated by an increase in deep nephron SNGFR. Based on recent findings concerning the effects of ADH on the medullary (M) part of the thick ascending limbs (TAL), we suggest that the increase in deep nephron SNGFR after ADH may be due to a change in the tubuloglomerular feedback signal at the macula densa resulting from ADH-induced stimulation of the solute reabsorption in the MTAL. Superficial nephrons would be less sensitive to this change due to their long cortical TAL, which removes the macula densa further from the MTAL and provides additional sites for solute reabsorption.",M2
6735146,"Plasma antidiuretic hormone levels and kidney responsiveness to vasopressin in the jerboa, Jaculus orientalis.The plasma antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) concentration and the kidney medulla responsiveness to vasopressin were measured in adult jerboas ( Jaculus orientalis) in different states of hydration. In 15 jerboas adapted to 30 degrees and fed a dry diet, the average ADH concentration in blood plasma was 479 +/- 59 pg/ml, as measured by a radioimmunoassay. About 6 hr after receiving a 5% body wt water load by gavage, the plasma ADH concentration fell to 130 +/- 30 pg/ml in the 5 jerboas still producing hypertonic urine (1022 +/- 267 mosmol/liter) and to 41.5 +/- 8.4 pg/ml in the 6 jerboas producing hypoosmotic urine (157 +/- 6 mosmol/liter). In vitro biochemical experiments were performed on the kidney medullas from two groups of 5 jerboas fed a dry diet (group I) or a water-enriched diet (group II), respectively, for 4 to 7 weeks. Compared to group II, group I animals exhibited (a) higher plasma ADH values, 372 +/- 86 versus 76 +/- 25 pg/ml; (b) higher urine osmolarities (3817 +/- 638 versus 647 +/- 90 mosmol/liter); (c) some decrease in [3H]lysine-vasopressin (LVP) binding capacity to kidney membrane fractions (maximal binding: 0.4 versus 0.6 pmol [3H]LVP bound/mg protein); d) decreased adenylate cyclase responses to arginine-vasopressin, lysine-vasopressin, and oxytocin in kidney membrane fractions; and (e) weaker adenylate cyclase responses to arginine-vasopressin in microdissected pieces of the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. The values found for (a) the dissociation constant of [3H]lysine-vasopressin binding to membranes (KD); (b) adenylate cyclase sensitivity to the three neurohypophyseal hormones (KA); and (c) adenylate cyclase sensitivity to arginine-vasopressin (KA) in medullary collecting tubules and medullary thick ascending limbs are similar in the two groups of jerboas and roughly comparable to those previously reported for the rat kidney medulla. The reduced maximal adenylate cyclase responses to vasopressin in the jerboas fed a dry diet might indicate some physiological  down regulation  of the number of vasopressin-specific receptors in the kidney as a result of the huge ADH concentration present in blood plasma under these conditions. However, this desensitization is not sufficient to account for the production of hypoosmotic urine in spite of the relatively high ADH plasma levels which persisted after acute overhydration.",M2
6329898,"Plasma antidiuretic hormone levels and liver vasopressin receptors in the jerboa, Jaculus orientalis, and rat.V1 vasopressin, angiotensin, alpha-adrenergic, and glucagon receptors in liver were studied on membrane fractions prepared from two groups of jerboas ( Jaculus orientalis) given dry or water-enriched diets for periods of 4 to 7 weeks, and from rats acutely treated with pharmacological amounts of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) or (1-deamino-8-D-arginine)-vasopressin (dDAVP). Tritiated (8-lysine)-vasopressin ([3H]vasopressin), tritiated (1-asparagine-5-valine)-angiotensin II ([3H]angiotensin II), tritiated dihydroergocryptine ([3H] DHEC ), and iodinated glucagon ([125I]-glucagon) were used as specific labeled ligands of these receptors. The V1 vasopressin, angiotensin, alpha-adrenergic, and glucagon receptors detected in both groups of jerboas were identical to receptors found in rat liver plasma membranes in regard to the apparent dissociation constants for their respective labeled ligands. Furthermore, vasopressin receptors in jerboa liver membranes discriminated as efficiently as rat liver receptors between the natural neurohypophyseal peptides arginine-vasopressin and lysine-vasopressin on the one hand and the structural analogs (1-deamino-8-D-arginine)-vasopressin and (4-valine-8-D-arginine)-vasopressin on the other. The reduction of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) secretion in jerboas fed a water-enriched diet compared to those on a dry diet (75 +/- 25 pM versus 372 +/- 86 pM) was accompanied by an increase in the number of liver vasopressin receptors (2.79 +/- 0.53 versus 1.25 +/- 0.14 pmol [3H]vasopressin bound/mg protein). The modifications observed were specific for vasopressin receptors, as judged by the maximal binding capacities of [3H]angiotensin II, [3H] DHEC , and [125I]-glucagon, which remained unchanged in jerboas whatever the levels of endogenous circulating ADH. Similarly, administration of pharmacological doses of AVP by iv infusion to rats induced, 2 hr later, a loss of about 50% of V1 liver vasopressin receptors, while the numbers and apparent dissociation constants of angiotensin, alpha-adrenergic, and glucagon liver receptors remained unchanged, and V2 kidney vasopressin receptors were almost desensitized. For V1 liver and V2 kidney vasopressin receptors, the desensitization process was strikingly dependent on the antidiuretic/glycogenolytic activity ratio of the peptide used. Thus, im injection to rats of dDAVP (an analog possessing a very high antidiuretic/glycogenolytic activity ratio) induced, 1 hr later, a total loss of V2 kidney receptors without modification of the number and apparent dissociation constant of V1 liver receptors.",M2
6367609,"The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone associated with cleft palate: report of a case and review of the literature.A case of the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone syndrome (SIADH) associated with uneventful repair of a cleft palate in a child with Pierre Robin syndrome is reported. Excess secretion of <e>ADH</e> is seen with pulmonary disease, intracranial infections, and trauma and as a side effect of numerous drugs. Symptoms may be vague but ultimately progress to seizure or coma. Diagnosis is made by confirming hyponatremia and serum hyposmolality in the presence of less than maximally dilute urine with relative sodium wasting. Treatment usually consists of reversing the underlying disorder, fluid restriction, and occasionally hypertonic saline or drug administration. Because of its association with neurological disorders, SIADH should be considered in any patient with an unexplained change in neurological symptoms.",M2
6374413,"Relationship between plasma arginine vasopressin and renal water handling in decompensated cirrhosis.Although an impairment in renal water excretion is a commonly encountered clinical problem in cirrhotic patients, the mechanisms responsible for this abnormality are uncertain. <e>ADH</e> levels are elevated in some patients with decompensated cirrhosis, but a causal relationship between these levels and impaired water excretion has not been established. Since in normal man, water immersion to the neck (NI) results in a preferential central hypervolemia (CV), without plasma compositional change, and a resultant suppression of AVP, we designed the present study to determine if the diuretic response of cirrhotic patients to NI is mediated by a decrease in AVP. 17 cirrhotic patients with ascites were studied following 14 h of dehydration on two occasions: during a seated control study (C) and during 4 h of NI. AVP, determined by RIA, was measured every 30 min. 12 of the 17 patients manifested a diuresis that equalled or exceeded that documented in normal hydropenic subjects during immersion. NI did not alter mean AVP as compared with either the pre-study hour or those of the corresponding control study. Furthermore, peak V and CH2O varied independently of prestudy AVP (r = -0.116), mean change in AVP (r = -0.060), as well as nadir AVP levels (r = -0.122). The demonstration of a diuresis in some of the subjects, occurring without concomitant suppression of plasma AVP, suggests that ADH may constitute a permissive rather than pivotal factor in the impaired water excretion of many patients with advanced liver disease.",M2
6360918,"Renin-aldosterone axis in ethanol intoxication: effect of an <e>ADH</e> analogue (desaminocys1-D-arg8-vasopressin, DDAVP).Plasma renin activity (PRA) is stimulated and renin-aldosterone nexus is broken in acute ethanol intoxication. Serial changes in renin-aldosterone axis were studied in five healthy males during moderate ethanol intoxication, while alcohol diuresis was prevented by 20 micrograms of an antidiuretic hormone analogue, desaminocys1-D-arg8-vasopressin (DDAVP), administered intranasally. The experiment was performed with the subject supine, and the amount of ethanol taken p.o., at a steady rate in 90 min, was 1.2 g/kg body weight, diluted with juice to 20 vol% solution. DDAVP prevented the stimulation of PRA, suggesting that dehydration due to alcohol diuresis is the main reason for this phenomenon during ethanol intoxication. However, there still was a dissociation between PRA and aldosterone, which may be caused by increased serum Na+/K+ ratio or an inhibitory action of ethanol on aldosterone secretion.",M2
6304940,"Fluoride-induced changes in renal papillary cyclic-AMP.Studies were conducted which examined urinary excretion and papillary production of cyclic-AMP in the rat following vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) stimulation in the presence or absence of inorganic fluoride ion (F). In one set of experiments, six anesthetized Fischer 344 rats were administered 5 munits arginine vasopressin during iv saline and sodium fluoride (NaF) infusions. Urinary cyclic-AMP concentration was unchanged by ADH but declined during NaF infusion, while urinary cyclic-AMP excretion rate was unchanged by ADH or ADH/NaF. In a second set of experiments, 30 rats were divided into six groups of 5 each, and renal papilla and cortex were analyzed for cyclic-AMP. Group I was decapitated and not otherwise surgically manipulated. A second group had iv saline for 90 min while a third group had iv saline and ADH. A fourth group had isotonic NaF iv for 90 min and a fifth group had NaF and ADH. The results indicate that papillary cyclic-AMP is significantly increased by both ADH and NaF doses which did not cause changes in urinary cyclic-AMP excretion rates. We conclude from these experiments that determination of urinary cyclic-AMP concentration is not the best measure of vasopressin action and that tubular sensitivity to the hormone in the presence of F was better demonstrated by changes in papillary cyclic-AMP concentration. Further, it appears that the site of the biochemical renal lesion caused by F is at a site beyond the generation of cyclic-AMP.",M2
6306052,"Interactions among prostaglandin E2, antidiuretic hormone, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in modulating Cl- absorption in single mouse medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle.This paper describes the inhibitory effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>)-stimulated net Cl- absorption and spontaneous transepithelial voltage (Ve) in single medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle (TALH, thick ascending limb; mTALH, medullary segment; cTALH, cortical segment) obtained from mouse kidney. The experimental data indicate that PGE2 reduced the ADH-dependent values of net Cl- absorption (JnetCl, eq cm-2 s-1) and Ve (mV) in a dose-dependent manner; that increasing concentrations of peritubular ADH reversed the PGE2-mediated reductions in the ADH-dependent moiety of Ve in the mouse mTALH; that PGE2 had no effect on cyclic AMP-stimulated increments in Ve in the mouse mTALH; and that PGE2 had no effect on Ve in the cTALH, where Ve is unaffected either by ADH or by cyclic AMP. These effects might be obtained because of a direct competition between ADH and PGE2 for receptor binding on basolateral membranes. Alternatively, PGE2 might have reduced the affinities between ADH-receptor units and a component(s) of the series of processes leading to adenyl cyclase activation. The latter argument requires that basolateral membranes of the mouse mTALH exhibit receptor reserve, i.e., at the minimum concentration of ADH required to enhance Ve and JnetCl maximally, a fraction of basolateral membrane ADH receptors were unoccupied. According to this view, increasing peritubular ADH concentrations might reverse the PGE2-mediated reduction in ADH-dependent salt transport by increasing the number of basolateral membrane receptors occupied by ADH.",M2
6337960,"Mechanism of increased renin release in the adrenalectomized rat. Adrenal insufficiency and renin.We have previously suggested that inhibition of renin release by sodium chloride is related to absorptive chloride transport in the loop of Henle. Infusion of sodium chloride fails to inhibit renin release in the adrenalectomized (Adx) rat, and dexamethasone restores renin responsiveness to sodium chloride. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between loop function (urinary diluting and concentration capacity) and plasma renin concentration (PRC) in the Adx rat. After hypotonic sodium chloride infusion, free water clearance (CH2O) of Adx rats (0.56 ml/hr/100 g +/- 0.17 SE) was decreased (p less than 0.01) compared to controls (2.86 ml/hr/100 g +/- 0.29 SE); PRC of Adx rats (61.9 units/ml +/- 11.2 SE) was increased (p less than 0.01) above controls (6.0 units/ml +/- 1.7 SE). These differences persisted after administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Et)VAVP, a potent <e>ADH</e> antagonist. In separate groups of animals, after water deprivation, urine concentration of Adx rat (1,401 mOsm/kg +/- 45 SE) was less (p less than 0.01) than that of controls (2,117 mOsm/kg +/- 169 SE). Dexamethasone normalized both CH2O and urinary concentrating ability and also decreased PRC in Adx rats. Thus, in the glucocorticoid deficient rat, increased renin release is associated with impaired loop function. The loop defect may account for high PRC that is not suppressed by sodium chloride.",M2
6824079,"Stimulation by antidiuretic hormone of electrolyte tubular reabsorption in rat kidney.The effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) on renal excretion and tubular transport of water and electrolytes were investigated in homozygous DI Brattleboro rats. To ascertain these effects on the loop of Henle, circulating glucagon, parathyroid hormone, and thyrocalcitonin were reduced before the experiments, as these hormones are believed to stimulate the same cells of the thick ascending limb as <e>ADH</e>. dDAVP did not alter either glomerular or proximal tubular functions. In the loop, it consistently raised reabsorption of Mg, Ca, K, and, to a lesser extent, Na and Cl, but phosphate transport was not affected. dDAVP lowered the urinary excretion rates for Mg, Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes. For Mg, this reduction was independent of the drop in the urinary flow rate following dDAVP administration but was significantly correlated to this drop in the case of Ca, K, Cl, and total solutes. Na and P excretions were not altered by dDAVP. It is concluded that, in vivo, administration of ADH 1) stimulates reabsorption of Na, Cl, Mg, Ca, and K by the thick ascending limb, 2) consistently enhances Mg reabsorption by the whole kidney by enhancing reabsorption in the loop of Henle, and 3) at maximal antidiuresis, raises Ca, K, Cl, and total solute reabsorption, probably because of the drop in tubular flow rates in the distal parts of the nephron consequent to the hormone administration.",M2
6316581,"Alteration in surface substructure of frog urinary bladder by calcium ionophore, verapamil and antidiuretic hormone.The calcium antagonist verapamil and the calcium ionophore A23187 have been shown to inhibit the hydro-osmotic actions of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) presumably by different mechanisms. Presently, urinary bladders of the frog (Rana pipiens) were examined under SEM following exposure to calcium ionophore A23187, verapamil and ADH in the presence and absence of an osmotic gradient. Cells exposed to ADH show marked changes in surface substructure which is accompanied by an expansion of microridges, cell borders and the appearance of microvilli in the granular cells. The microvilli are pronounced and appear at the junction of microridges. In the presence of an osmotic gradient, ADH induces granular cell swelling and some cells show a blistering effect. Calcium ionophore, in the absence of an osmotic gradient, induced pronounced morphological changes in the granular cells, where the microvilli become prominently visible as 'finger-like' projections. This effect may be due to the action of calcium in promoting elongation of microtubules. Cells exposed to ionophore plus ADH are indistinguishable from ionophore alone. The most apparent effect of verapamil on surface substructure was on the elevation of the mitochondrial-rich cells above the surrounding granular cells. These cells show some degree of separation from the granular cells and are accentuated in tissues exposed to verapamil plus ADH. The present observations suggest that these agents, verapamil and calcium ionophore, have marked effects on cellular morphology. These actions are mediated through alterations in calcium movements and reflect the relative importance of cellular calcium in transepithelial water flow and the actions of antidiuretic hormone.",M2
7158228,"Central role of angiotensin in the hyperosmolality- and hypovolaemia-induced vasopressin release in conscious rats.To evaluate a central role of angiotensin in vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) release in response to hyperosmolality or hypovolaemia, we examined in conscious rats the effects of intraperitoneal (ip) injections of 2 ml/100 g body weight of hypertonic saline or polyethylene glycol (PEG; 250 mg/ml of 145 mM NaCl) on plasma ADH and angiotensin II (AII) levels and of intracerebroventricular (icv) administrations of Sar1-Ala8-AII (a competitive receptor blocker for AII) on the plasma ADH responses to the ip injections. Thirty min after ip injections of 900 mM NaCl, plasma ADH, osmolality and sodium increased with unchanged plasma AII and with reduced haematocrit. Two h after ip administrations of PEG, plasma ADH, AII and haematocrit were augmented with unaltered plasma osmolality and sodium. The responses of plasma ADH to ip injections of 900 mM NaCl and PEG were significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) by 1 microgram of Sar1-Ala8-AII injected icv 5 min before blood samplings which had no appreciable effect on plasma osmolality, electrolytes and haematocrit. Based on these results, we concluded that angiotensin may participate in both the hyperosmolality- and hypovolaemia-induced ADH secretion by acting on the central nervous system.",M2
7111663,"Regulation of urine osmolality in fetal sheep.Urine osmolality was measured daily from day of cannulation (80-110 d) until term in six chronically cannulated ovine fetuses. Fetal urine was hypertonic to plasma following surgery, and 24-36 h before parturition. On fifty-five occasions plasma antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) concentration was measured concurrently with urine osmolality. When fetal urine osmolality was 154 +/- 45 mosmol/kg water, plasma ADH was 5.6 +/- 2.1 pg/ml (mean +/- S.D.; n = 33) in fetuses less than 120 d gestation. In ten samples from fetuses from 121 d to term urine osmolality was 118 +/- 35 mosmol/kg water when the concurrent plasma ADH concentration was 5.5 +/- 2.1 pg/ml. Urine osmolality greater than 300 mosmol/Kg water was associated with endogenous plasma ADH concentrations of 6.2-9.2 pg/ml in fetuses 86 d until term. However, when exogenous synthetic arginine vasopressin (AVP) was infused into  non-stressed fetuses with initial urine osmolalities less than 200 mosmol/Kg water, the minimum plasma ADH concentration that had to be established in order to induce the production of a hypertonic urine was 22.1 pg/ml at gestational ages 95-105 d, 11-1 pg/ml at 110-120 d and 7 pg/ml at 121-130 d. The fetal kidney thus becomes more responsive to infused AVP over the last half of gestation. Under conditions of in utero stress, however, hypertonic urine can be produced at lower endogenous plasma ADH concentrations than required to be established by infusion in non-stressed fetuses, suggesting that urinary concentrating mechanisms independent of ADH are established in these fetuses.",M2

Blood samples were obtained preoperatively (twice), intraoperatively (9 times) and postoperatively (3 times) for analysing the following parameters: 1. antidiuretic hormone (ADH, arginine-vasopressin) 2. serum electrolytes (potassium, sodium) 3. plasma osmolality In three patients unexpected sudden blood loss occurred, accompanied by typical haemodynamic changes. Pre- and intraoperative ADH-levels were normal with a slight increase at the end of the operative procedure. Electrolytes and osmolality in serum/plasma stayed within the normal range during the whole investigation period. In three patients suffering from shock due to unexpected blood loss ADH-levels rose excessively. The data demonstrate the well-known stress-attenuation under EDA as well as an increase of ADH-secretion in haemodynamic alteration.",M2
7079379,"Effects of lithium on circadian cycles in food and water intake, urinary concentration and body weight in rats.Circadian cycles in food and water intake, urinary concentration and body weight were studied in normal rats, lithium-polyuric rats, rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus and rats infused continuously with arginine vasopressin (<e>ADH</e>) 10 mU/hr IV. Normal rats showed characteristic cycles in body weight and urine flow and osmolality with diuresis in the dark (eating and drinking period) and antidiuresis in the light (resting) period. ADH-infusion eliminated the circadian cycle in urine osmolality, but not in urine flow, suggesting that factors besides. ADH mediate the antidiuresis during the resting period. Rats with ADH-deficient diabetes insipidus showed obliteration of all circadian cycles studied, indicating the importance of the renal concentrating mechanism for the amplitude of the circadian-cycles, observed in normal rats. In rats treated with lithium, circadian cycles in body weight and urine osmolality were absent. However, there was a significant circadian variation in urine flow and food and water consumption with peak values during the light period, when normal rats showed minimal values. It is concluded that in rats lithium causes marked changes in circadian cycles, which probably cannot be explained by its effect on the renal concentrating mechanisms alone.",M2
6951096,"Role of renal prostaglandins during antidiuresis and water diuresis in man.The relationship of renal prostaglandins to antidiuretic hormone action and water diuresis was examined in 13 normal subjects and 2 subjects with diabetes insipidus. Following overnight water deprivation, a oral water load caused a prompt and sustained rise in the rate of urinary PGE2 excretion from 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 81.6 +/- 26.4 ng/hr (P less than 0.0001) in 7 normal subjects. Because the simultaneous increase in urinary excretion of urea was only 17% of the rise in urinary PGE2, passive wash-out of renal PGE2 probably accounts for only a small fraction of the increment in PGE2 excretion. Administration of the antidiuretic hormone analogue DDAVP to 6 normal subjects during sustained water diuresis resulted in a decrease in PGE2 excretion and urine flow rate comparable to that of dehydrated subjects. Thus, PGE2 excretion varied directly with urine flow rate over a wide range of states of hydration in all 13 normal subjects. One patient with central diabetes insipidus and one with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus demonstrated a similar positive correlation of PGE2 excretion rate and urinary flow rate in states of hydration, dehydration, and after administration of DDAVP. In the patient with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, this relationship of PGE2 excretion rate to urine flow rate was unaffedted by DDAVP over a broad range of urine flow rates. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin in 6 normal subjects resulted in a significant decline in free water clearance (7.7 +/- 1.0 to 4.7 +/- 0.9 ml/min. P less than 0.001) and an increase in the minimal UOsm (61 +/- 4 to 93 +/- 19 mOsm/kg. P less than 0.01) achieved during water diuresis without a change in creatinine or osmolar clearances. Furthermore, the tightly linked relationship of PGE2 excretion rate to urine flow rate was reduced in 5 of 6 subjects during indomethacin treatment. We conclude that urinary PGE2 excretion varies directly with urine flow rate and is not directly dependent on <e>ADH</e> activity or state of hydration in man. The rise in PGE2 excretion during water diuresis may enhance the excretion of free water since indomethacin treatment blunted free water clearance while suppressing the rise in PGE2 excretion.",M2
7072518,"Defects in osmoregulation of vasopressin secretion. A report of four cases.Four patients are presented, all having pathologic responses in plasma vasopressin concentration to changes in plasma osmolality. Clinically, three of them had the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The fourth had diabetes insipidus associated with an increased threshold for plasma osmolality. Two of the patients with SIADH had lowered thresholds for <e>ADH</e> secretion and one of these also had increased sensitivity to increments in osmolality. The latter patient, like another earlier reported similar case, had a defective blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The third SIADH patient had no response at all to changes in osmolality from 230 to 305 mOsm/kg and had a small cell carcinoma of the lung. These examples illustrate that both the setting and the sensitivity of osmoreceptors and AVP-secreting neurons probably are under complex control from the CNS, and that CNS diseases can affect one or several of these pathways thereby affecting the setting of the osmoreceptor-vasopressin system.",M2

Findings showed that dDAVP and dVDAVP decreased the diuresis of all ADH-sensitive patients, and in those with diabetes insipidus, more markedly (7.6-fold) and for a longer duration (3.3-fold) than did LVP. From a comparison of the results, dVDAVP is at present one of the most effective preparations for reduction of polyuria in patients with ADH-sensitive diabetes insipidus.",M2

6799525,"Retention of antidiuretic hormone-induced particle aggregates by luminal membranes separated from toad bladder epithelial cells.Aggregates of intramembrane particles appear in the luminal membranes of renal collecting duct and amphibian bladder cells after stimulation by antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>). We undertook this freeze-fracture study to determine whether particle aggregates, once in place, remain in the luminal membrane of the amphibian bladder after the membrane is physically separated from the rest of the cell. We found that the aggregates do remain in high yield in isolated membranes stabilized with a bifunctional imidoester (DTBP) followed by fixation with glutaraldehyde, or unfixed but stabilized with DTBP. These findings support the view that the particles are intrinsic membrane components and that their organization in the form of aggregates does not depend on the presence of the intact cell. In addition, the availability of isolated membranes containing particle aggregates provides a starting point for the isolation of the water-conducting proteins.",M2
6761298,"The effect of antidiuretic hormone, indomethacin and naproxen on prostaglandin synthesis of experimentally infected and healthy kidneys.The authors studied the effect of indomethacin and naproxen on the changes of renal prostaglandin E and F2 alpha concentration in experimental kidney infection, as well as the action of arginine-vasopressin in healthy rats. Naproxen proved to be an effective inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, as did indomethacin. In control animals an increased prostaglandin E and F2 alpha synthesis was observed caused by arginine vasopressin. It is supposed that <e>ADH</e>--depending on its concentration--has a metabolic modulator role in prostaglandin synthesis, which raises the possibility of a self-regulatory mechanism of water reabsorption.",M2
7263837,"Dual effects of antidiuretic hormone on urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion in man.To evaluate the relationship of renal prostaglandin synthesis to urine-concentrating mechanisms, 14 healthy subjects received antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>) and the nonpressor ADH analog desamino-d-arginine vasopressin (dD'AVP). Endogenous ADH was increased by water deprivation. Urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was measured by RIA and by bioassay. ADH, dD'AVP, and dehydration each reduced urinary volume by a similar amount (from 582 +/- 66 to an average of 141 +/- 13 ml/4 h) and similarly increased osmolality (from 231 +/- 13 to 721 +/- 31 mosmol/kg). Dehydration and dD'AVP reduced PGE2 from 44 +/- 4 to 25 +/- 5 and 30 +/- 5 ng/4 h, respectively (P less than 0.01), suggesting an inverse correlation of PGE2 with urine osmolality (r = -0.48; P less than 0.005). In contrast, ADH increased urinary PGE2 to 102 +/- 23 ng/4 h (P less than 0.02). Infusions of another vasoconstrictor peptide, angiotensin II, to six of the subjects doubled urine osmolality and also increased urinary PGE2 excretion. These data do not support the theory that the antidiuretic effect of ADH enhances PG synthesis; instead, the data indicate that ADH has two effects on PGE2 excretion: 1) stimulation, presumably by pharmacological pressor activity, and 2) inhibition by antidiuresis.",M2
7031229,"Calcium dependency of the inhibitory effect of antidiuretic hormone on in vitro renin secretion in rats.1. Synthetic arginine-vasopressin (<e>ADH</e> or antidiuretic hormone) inhibited renin secretory rate of rat renal cortical slices. The response was concentration-dependent and was maximal at 0.1 U . ml.-1. 2. Ca depletion (incubation of slices in medium containing Na2EGTA and no added CaCl2) stimulated renin secretion and eventually abolished the inhibitory effect of ADH. Both these effects were reversible. 3. The Ca antagonist D-600, at 0.5 microM, reversed the inhibitory effect of K depolarization on secretory rate but had no effect on secretory rate on on-depolarized slices. In the presence of 0.5 microM-D-600, ADH inhibited the secretory rate of either depolarized or non-depolarized slices. 4. These results confirm and extend previous observations suggesting that Ca plays an inhibitory coupling role in the control of renin secretion. Moreover they suggest that although Ca influx through voltage-sensitive Ca channels influences the secretory activity of juxtaglomerular cells, ADH activates an independent pathway for Ca mobilization.",M2
7205662,"Dose-dependent stimulation of renal prostaglandin synthesis by deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin in rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus.It has been postulated that renal prostaglandins (PGs) function as negative feedback inhibitors of the action of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>), implying a correlation between levels of ADH and the rate of renal PG synthesis. These studies have evaluated the relationship between renal PG synthesis and hormone levels in rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus, a species devoid of circulating ADH. Since vasoconstrictor agents can stimulate renal PG synthesis by mechanisms unrelated to antidiuretic activity, deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) was utilized for replacement therapy instead of arginine vasopressin, which has considerable pressor activity. dDAVP was administered by S.C. implanted osmotic minipumps to obtain steady states of dDAVP at different dose levels. As indices of renal PG synthesis, urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PGE2 excretion, although increased by dDAVP treatment, was not correlated with dose of dDAVP. However, PGF2 alpha excretion was highly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.97, P less than .01). The sum (PGE2 + PGF2 alpha), which may more accurately reflect total medullary PG synthesis, was also significantly correlated with dose of dDAVP (r = 0.98, P less than .001). It is concluded that dDAVP stimulates renal PG synthesis in a dose-related fashion. This occurs at doses which bring urine osmolality into the normal physiological range. Furthermore, it is shown that stimulation of renal PG synthesis by arginine vasopressin is not due primarily to its pressor action. These experiments also provide evidence that urinary PGE2 and PGF2 alpha excretion can vary independently.",M2
7007402,"Isoosmotic central blood volume expansion suppresses plasma arginine vasopressin in normal man.Despite numerous studies which have characterized the regulation of antidiuretic hormone (<e>ADH</e>), the role of volume in governing ADH release remains incompletely defined. Most studies have examined the quantitative effects of hypovolemia on arginine vasopressin (AVP). In contrast, few have assessed the role of hypervolemia on AVP regulation. Furthermore, there are no data to date on the effect of acute isoosmotic volume expansion on plasma AVP in man. The successful characterization of the water immersion model (NI) and the demonstration that it induces an acute central volume expansion without changes in plasma composition commended its utilization in the present study. Twelve normal subjects were studied after 14 h of dehydration on two occasions: control and during 4 h of NI. Blood was obtained every 30 min for AVP. AVP was unaltered during the control period. In contrast, there was a prompt and sustained suppression of AVP throughout NI (P &lt; 0.05 vs. control). There were no concomitant changes in plasma osmolality. Since the changes in AVP occurred consequent to central volume expansion but in the absence of concomitant changes in plasma composition, the current data support the concept that acute isoosmotic central volume expansion in man results in a suppression of plasma AVP.",M2

6255807,"Temperature effect on <e>ADH</e> response of isolated perfused rabbit collecting tubules.The time course of the water permeability response to synthetic arginine vasopressin (AVP) was examined in isolated perfused rabbit collecting tubules. When experiments were conducted at 37 degrees C, addition of AVP in a concentration of 100 microU/ml increased hydraulic water permeability (Lp) from 18 +/- 4 X 10(-7) to 153 +/- 15 X 10(-7) cm x s-1 x atm-1. However, in contrast to results obtained at 25 degrees C, the Lp immediately decreased in spite of the continued presence of AVP, reaching half the peak value in 67 +/- 6 (SE) min. A similar decline was observed at 37 degrees C when a cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate analogue was added to the bathing medium. Corticosteroids greatly enhanced the peak water absorption but did not stabilize the subsequent response to AVP at 37 degrees C. A decline in diffusional water permeability measured in the absence of a transtubule osmotic gradient excluded the possible roles of cellular hypotonicity, increased cell volume, or osmotic water absorption in the unstable response to hormone. The peritubular membrane remained highly permeable to water, independent of AVP and temperature. Duration of exposure to 37 degrees C was more important than AVP in determining the unstable response. On the basis of these studies we conclude that isolated rabbit cortical collecting tubules progressively become insensitive to AVP at 37 degrees C, possibly due to alterations in the responsiveness of the urinary plasma membrane to cAMP.",M2

7404574,"Radioimmunoassay of arginine vasopressin in human plasma and urine, a resin microcolumn method.A new method was developed for the estimation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma and urine. Samples were extracted by a microcolumn of resin and assayed radioimmunologically using a highly sensitive antiserum to AVP. Ion-exchange resin, CG-50, H+ form, packed in a small column (diameter 4 mm, height 6 mm), was proved effective to remove the interfering substances and to concentrate the AVP in the sample. The application of 80% acid acetone successive to diluted HCl brought about a consistent recovery of AVP from the resin column. Recoveries were 66.4 +/- 8.5% for plasma and 85.4 +/- 9.7% for urine. In normal subjects plasma AVP levels were 3.9 +/  0.3 pg/ml (mean +/- S.D.) in ambulatory states, 4.9 +/- ).6 after overnight fast, and 0.4 +/- 0.2 after water lading. High levels of 2.0 +/- 24.2 pg/ml were obtained in patinents with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of <e>ADH</e> (SIADH), low values of 0-1.8 pg/ml in diabetes inipidus. Urinary excretions of AVP were 117.4 +/- 59.4 ng/24/hr (mean +/- S.D.) in normal controls, 191 +/- 177.0/24 hr in SIADH, and 17.0 +/- 12.0/24 hr in diabetes insipidus.",M2
7457488,"Water metabolism in diabetes mellitus.Transcellular shifts of water and changes in the physiology of water excretion are common in diabetes mellitus and its treatment. Recent evidence indicates that hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, but not in normal subjects, is characterized by elevations of circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP; antidiuretic hormone, <e>ADH</e>). The role and importance of these observations remain to be defined since elevations of plasma AVP levels do not decrease water excretion in diabetic patients. Certain oral sulfonylureas, notably chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, are known to decrease renal free water clearance (CH2O), whereas insulin increases CH2O; the insulin and tolbutamide effects may be clinically trivial, whereas that of chlorpropamide is important. The hyponatremic effect of chlorpropamide may be exaggerated in diabetic patients by concomitant diuretic therapy. Euglycemia during chlorpropamide therapy appears to allow full expression of the action of chlorpropamide on CH2O; hyperglycemia with attendant osmotic diuresis protects chlorpropamide-treated patients against hyponatremia. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents enhances expression of the ADH effect on the kidney, but it does not appear to potentiate chlorpropamide hyponatremia. Two other oral sulfonylurea agents, tolazamide and glyburide, increase CH2O. Diazoxide is an antihypertensive thiazide which is antidiuretic as well as hyperglycemic. Thus, abnormalities of water metabolism are common in diabetes mellitus. Whether certain of these abnormalities are clinically important depends upon the presence of the osmotic diuresis of hyperglycemia and the pharmacology of diabetic management.",M2
