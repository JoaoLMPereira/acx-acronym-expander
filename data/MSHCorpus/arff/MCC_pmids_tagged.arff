15842799,"[Study on loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability in hepatocellular carcinoma]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor suppressor genes (TSG) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in hepatocarcinogenesis, as well as their correlation with clinicopathologic features. METHODS: LOH in 6 TSG (APC, DCC, <e>MCC</e>, OGG1, p53 and RB1) was detected in 36 informative cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), among 92 surgically resected HCC. Thirteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were also studied in 15 of these cases by microdissection-based PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing. The correlation between genetic alterations and clinicopathologic features was analyzed. RESULTS: The overall incidence of LOH in HCC was 41.7% (15/36). There was no LOH in MCC gene. 46.2% (6/13) microsatellites showed LOH in 9 of the 15 cases of HCC (60%). Certain clinicopathologic differences were observed between cases (number = 7) with LOH in APC, OGG1 and DCC ( type I ) and cases (number = 8) with LOH in p53 and RB1 ( type II ). The mean tumor size of these two types was 2.9 (+/- 1.7) cm and 7.2 (+/- 3.4) cm, respectively (P &lt; 0.01); and the mean survival was 72.0 (+/- 38.6) months, and 51.0 (+/- 30.4) months, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MSI pathway, LOH pathway plays a more important role in the development of HCC. A multistep hepatocarcinogenesis is likely, with LOH in APC, OGG1 and DCC ( type I ) being an early event and LOH in p53 and RB1 ( type II ) being a late event. On the other hand, MCC gene seems to play no role in the whole process.",M1
12901725,"Loss of heterozygosity at APC and <e>MCC</e> genes of oral cancer and leukoplakia tissues from Indian tobacco chewers.BACKGROUND: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at tumor suppressor genes, such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mutated in colon cancer (MCC) genes, is one of the early events in carcinogenesis of oral tissue in Caucasian and Chinese patients. We wanted to check whether it is also true in Indian oral pre-cancer and cancer patients. METHODS: Loss of heterozygosity at APC and MCC genes was investigated in 57 and 40 unrelated primary oral leukoplakia (a pre-cancerous lesion) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In these samples, most of the leukoplakia patients had tobacco smoking habit whereas majority of cancer patients had tobacco chewing habit. LOH at APC gene was observed in 4 of 16 (25%) and 1 of 29 (3%) informative tumor and leukoplakia DNAs from tobacco chewers, respectively. LOH at MCC gene was not detected either in tumor or in leukoplakia DNAs. CONCLUSION: This infrequent LOH at APC gene of pre-cancer and cancer tissues suggests that it may not be an early event in oral carcinogenesis in these patients.",M1
12901620,"Study of loss of heterozygosity at DCC and APC/<e>MCC</e> genetic loci of gastric cancer.In order to assess the role of the changes of DCC and APC/MCC genes in the development and progression of gastric cancer, the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of these genetic loci was investigated in 45 surgical specimens of gastric cancer with PCR-RFLP. The rate of LOH was 30.0% (9/30) at APC/MCC gene and 33.3% (15/45) at DCC gene. LOH was found in both intestinal and gastric types of gastric cancer and the rate of LOH of DCC gene was significantly higher in stages III to approximately IV gastric cancer (48.0%) than in stages I to approximately II (15.0%) (P&lt;0.05). LOH of APC/MCC gene could be found in both early and advanced stages of gastric cancer. These findings suggest that changes of DCC and APC/MCC genes are involved in the development and progression of the intestinal and gastric types of gastric cancer.",M1
11776787,"[The possible role of loss of heterozygosity at APC, <e>MCC</e> and DCC genetic loci in esophageal carcinoma]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the alterations of APC, MCC and DCC genes in human esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: A total of 46 human esophageal cancer specimens were analyzed for the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at APC, MCC and DCC genetic loci by means of polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The incidence of LOH was 29.0%(9/31) at APC locus, 33.3%(8/24) at MCC locus, and 32.4%(12/37) at DCC locus, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant correlation between LOH at these three loci with such clinical parameters as pathological types, tumor size, invasiveness, and lymph-node metastasis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that LOH at APC, MCC and DCC loci in esophageal carcinoma is, to certain extent, a common genetic alteration which might play a role in esophageal carcinogenesis.",M1
11338478,"Allelic loss involving the tumor suppressor genes APC and <e>MCC</e> and expression of the APC protein in the development of dysplasia and carcinoma in Barrett esophagus.Samples of Barrett metaplastic specialized epithelium (SE), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and invasive adenocarcinoma (CA) derived from 36 esophagectomy specimens were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in APC and MCC and for expression of APC protein. Of 18 cases that were heterozygous (informative) for APC, LOH was found in none of 14 SE samples, 2 of 8 LGD samples, 3 of 11 HGD samples, and 5 of 17 CA samples. Immunohistochemically, markedly reduced expression of APC protein (&lt; 50% positive cells) was found in 3 of 19 HGD samples and 4 of 35 CA samples but not in SE or LGD samples. Of 17 cases informative for the MCC gene, LOH was detectable in 1 of 14 SE samples, none of 7 LGD samples, none of 9 HGD samples, and 4 of 16 CA samples. Allelic loss of APC and/or loss of APC protein expression occurs earlier in the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett esophagus than LOH in the MCC gene. The determination of alterations at APC or MCC would be of limited importance for the surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus.",M1
10605402,"Infrequent loss of heterozygosity of APC/<e>MCC</e> and DCC genes in gastric cancer showing DNA microsatellite instability.AIM: To investigate the role of DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) in gastric carcinogenesis by studying associations between MSI status, clinicopathological features, and loss of genetic loci. METHODS: Six microsatellite loci and loss of heterozygosity at APC, DCC, and MCC were analysed by polymerase chain reaction based methods in 53 cases of advanced gastric cancer. RESULTS: MSI was observed in 32.1% of gastric carcinomas (17/53) and 20% of foci of intestinal metaplasia (3/15). Seven gastric carcinomas (13.7%) were MSI-high (MSI-H) (three loci or more) and 10 (18.9%) were MSI-low (MSI-L) (one or two loci). The frequency of MSI-H was higher in intestinal (25.0%) than in diffuse carcinomas (3.7%) (p &lt; 0.05). None of the MSI-H tumours showed loss of heterozygosity at APC, MCC, or DCC loci. CONCLUSIONS: MSI may have an important and early role in a subset of gastric cancers, particularly the intestinal type. The MSI-H subset of gastric cancer has features in common with its colorectal counterpart, whereas MSI-L and microsatellite stable cancers appear to develop through the loss of heterozygosity pathway.",M1
10404094,"Genomic instability and alterations in Apc, <e>Mcc</e> and Dcc in Hong Kong patients with colorectal carcinoma.Our aim was to reveal the significance of tumor-suppressor genes and genomic instability in 99 Hong Kong Chinese colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients by PCR-LOH analysis and PCR-PTT assay. The frequencies of allelic loss of Apc, Mcc and Dcc and of APC truncation were 31.3% (15/48), 11.6% (5/43), 44.4% (20/45) and 46/93 (49.5%), respectively. The frequency of Apc LOH was similar to, the Mcc LOH was lower than, and the Dcc LOH was higher than that reported for Caucasians and Japanese. In Hong Kong CRC patients, the replication error-positive (RER(+)) phenotype occurred with a frequency of 10% (10/99), which was similar to other results using microsatellite markers where RER(+) frequencies ranged from 11% to 28%. The rates of genetic alteration in RER(+) tumors were lower in tumors harboring p53, Mcc and Dcc alterations; similar in Apc; and higher in Ki-ras tumors compared with RER(-) tumors, though these differences did not achieve statistical significance. None of the biomarkers examined were predictive of survival independently, but strong trends confirming earlier observations of associations between RER(+) phenotypes with proximal tumor location and poorly differentiated tumor status were noted. The RER(+) phenotype was correlated significantly to the less aggressive Duke's stage B and improved prognosis. Additionally, tumors with RER(+) phenotypes were positively correlated with young age and sex. Our results support the observation that a subset of younger male CRC patients in Hong Kong may develop CRC via the RER pathway and show differences in RER status and sex. A significantly higher percentage of older Hong Kong Chinese CRC patients had APC truncations. Int. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol.) 84:404-409, 1999.",M1
9473770,"Decreased expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) and mutated in colorectal cancer (<e>Mcc</e>) genes in mouse lung neoplasia.A decrease in the intracellular concentrations of the transcripts for some tumor suppressor genes has been found during murine lung tumorigenesis; for p15INK4b and p16INK4a, this was due to homozygous deletions. We report here a decrease in the mRNA levels of the mutated in colorectal cancer (Mcc) and adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) genes in mouse lung tumors and some neoplastic cell lines. This was assessed both by northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA isolated from lung tumors that had been induced by urethane, N-nitrosodiethylamine, or 3-methylcholanthrene in (A/J x C57BL/6) F1 or A/J mice. A reduced amount of both Mcc and Apc messages was also seen when two neoplastic cell lines, a spontaneous transformant (E9) and a line derived from a chemically induced solid tumor (82-132), were compared with two independently derived nontumorigenic cell lines (E10 and C10); E9 was derived from E10, and all of these lines are probably of alveolar type 2 cell origin. A cell line derived from a chemically induced papillary lung tumor probably of bronchiolar Clara cell origin (LM2) had Mcc mRNA levels similar to those of C10 and E10 but reduced Apc mRNA levels. A line (p53-823) derived from a papillary tumor that arose in a mouse with a mutated p53 transgene had a reduced amount of the Mcc gene product only. These differential changes in the relative amounts of Apc and Mcc messages in LM2 and p53-823) cells may serve as useful models for studying the regulation of their expression. Both messages had half-lives of 6-9 h in normal E10 and neoplastic E9 cells, so decreased message stability does not account for these reductions. This is the first report of estimated degradation rates of these mRNAs. Apc and Mcc message content did not vary as a function of growth status of the cell lines. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis did not reveal mutations in Apc coding regions known to have a high mutation frequency in human colon tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of Apc and Mcc was not found in tumors that developed in the F1 mice, implying a lack of allelic deletions. These changes in tumor suppressor gene expression may contribute to the development and maintenance of neoplasia in lung epithelium.",M1
9250932,"Loss of heterozygosity of APC and <e>MCC</e> genes in oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan.Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mutated in colon cancer (MCC) genes was investigated in 37 untreated human primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) using the polymerase chain reaction. LOH was observed in 14 of 26 (53.8%) heterozygous (informative) patients at APC and 9 of 13 (69.2%) heterozygous patients at MCC&gt; Homozygous deletion of MCC was detected in one patient. Of the 37 patients, 29 were informative at APC or MCC or both; LOH at APC and/or MCC was detected in 68.9% (20/29) of the cases. Ten cases were informative for both genes; LOH at both loci was found in only three of these cases. LOH at the APC and/or MCC was found in both early and advanced stages of oral SCCs. No significant correlation was observed between LOH at the APC and/or MCC locus and the patients' tobacco/betel quid consumption, tumour location, TNM status, or histological differentiation. These results suggest that LOH at the APC and/or MCC may be an early event and may play a role in the pathogenesis of human oral SCCs in Taiwan.",M1
8855982,"Infrequent alterations of the APC and <e>MCC</e> genes in gastric cancers from British patients.We examined 26 gastric carcinomas from British patients for mutations of the APC gene using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex assay in conjunction with the protein truncation test (PTT). In addition, we performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the APC and MCC genes. We detected an inactivating somatic mutation in one gastric tumour. LOH of APC was observed in one of 12 informative cases (8%) and of MCC in two of 20 cases (10%). We thus find that alteration of the APC and MCC genes are infrequent in gastric cancers from the British population. Tumour-suppressor genes on other chromosomes must play a more significant role in the development of these tumours.",M1
8943812,"Loss of heterozygosity at 5q21 in non-small cell lung cancer: a frequent event but without evidence of apc mutation.Four genetic polymorphisms in the APC and <e>MCC</e> genes at chromosome 5q21 were analysed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 97 primary squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung. LOH was identified in at least two polymorphic loci in 41 percent of informative cases. There was no significant difference in the frequency of LOH between squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Within the adenocarcinoma group, however, LOH appeared to be more common in tumours having a bronchial origin (5/9; 56 per cent) than in parenchymal adenocarcinoma (6/21; 29 per cent). All 32 tumours showing LOH at one or more polymorphic sites were examined for mutations in the mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Mutations were not detected in any of these cases. We therefore propose that it is likely that a tumour suppressor gene on 5q other than APC is involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.",M1
9592313,"[A study on the changes of DCC and <e>MCC</e> genes in colorectal carcinoma and adenoma]Both deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) and mutated in colorectal carcinomas (MCC) genes are newly found tumour suppresser genes in colorectal carcinomas. In this study mutations of DCC gene and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of MCC gene were detected with Southern blot and PCR methods respectively. The study consisted of 30 cases of colorectal adenoma (10 with mild, 10 with moderate and 10 with severe dysplasia) and 33 cases of colorectal carcinomas (13 highly, 10 moderately and 10 poorly differentiated, meanwhile 9 in Dukes A, 10 in B and 14 in C stage). Their paired normal colorectal mucosa served as control. The results were as follows: mutation of DCC was not found in any specimen with normal mucosa or with adenoma of mild and moderate dysplaaia, while it was found in one if those with severe dysplasia. Mutation of DCC was, however, found in 7 of the 33 specimens with carcinoma and there was a correlation between the positive rate and the differentiation or staging of the carcinoma. LOH of MCC was not found in normal mucosa, but it was found in 2/10, 3/10 and 4/10 of the adenoma specimens with mild, moderate and severe dysplasia respectively. 18/33 of the carcinoma specimens was found to have LOH of MCC and there was also a correlation between the positive rate and the differentiation or staging of the carcinoma. These results suggest that the frequency of multiple gene changes increase with poor differentiation and increased staging of colorectal carcinoma.",M1
9592312,"[A study on the loss of heterozygosity at the APC/<e>MCC</e> and DCC genetic loci in colorectal cancers]To evaluate the role of APC, MCC and DCC genes in the development and progression of colorectal cancers, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at these genetic loci was investigated in 41 surgically resected specimens of colorectal cancer by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. LOH at APC or/and MCC was detected in 38.9% (14/38) of the informative cases; at the APC in 28.0% (7/25) and at MCC locus in 36.4% (8/22). LOH at DCC genetic locus was detected in 55.3% (21/38) of the informative cases. LOH rates DCC gene in the cancer specimens with lymphnode metastasis (80.0%) and in Dukes' stage III and IV (71.4%) were significantly higher than that in specimens without lymphnode metastasis (39.1%) and in Dukes' stage I and II (35.3%) (P &lt; 0.05).

Here we report the identification, tissue specific distribution, subcellular localization, and growth regulating activity of MCC protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of MCC protein in various tissues of mouse revealed heavy cytoplasmic staining of brain neuronal cells and intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of the MCC gene by microinjection in normal NIH3T3 cell lines leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. These studies provide some initial clues to the function of the MCC protein and demonstrate that it negatively controls the cell cycle progression.",M1
8732100,"[Relation between loss of heterozygosity at APC and <e>MCC</e> genetic loci and biological behaviour of gastric carcinoma]In order to detect loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at APC and MCC genetic loci in gastric carcinoma, the authors established a micro-wax-mediated hot start PCR technique. This method allowed a specific gene amplification, and it was useful especially in the amplification of formalin-fixed or stained tissues. In 44 cases of gastric cancer, 29 cases were informative of the APC locus. LOH was found in 8 cases (27.6%): 2 cases in 2 moderately well-differentiated cancer, 2 cases in 13 differentiated cancer, and 4 cases in poorly-differentiated cancer. One of the 3 cases of gastric cancer at early stage also showed LOH. LOH at MCC locus was detected in only 2 of the 25 (8.0%) gastric cancer patients informative. These data suggest that abnormality of APC gene plays a role in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer and the change may occur at the early stage of tumor development.",M1
7585453,"Loss of heterozygosity of APC/<e>MCC</e> gene in differentiated and undifferentiated gastric carcinomas in Taiwan.Recently, two genes in 5q21 involved in colon carcinogenesis, APC and MCC, were identified, and also shown to be associated with the development of esophageal and lung cancers. To determine if these genes are also involved in the development of gastric cancer, 79 primary human gastric cancers were examined for loss of heterozygosity of APC or MCC or both. Loss of APC was detected in 20% of 15 informative differentiated cases, but not in 20 informative undifferentiated cases, while loss of MCC occurred in 23.5% of 17 informative undifferentiated cases, but not in 19 informative differentiated cases. These data suggest that loss of heterozygosity of APC/MCC gene is involved in the development of gastric carcinomas, and that distinctly different molecular mechanism(s) may be responsible for the development of differentiated and undifferentiated gastric carcinomas.",M1

The results showed that in 40.9% (9/22) of the specimen examined, the mutation spectrum of p53 in primary EC was similar to that in the esophageal epithelium of human fetus (in vitro) and monkey (in vivo) treated with NMBzA. The same mutational spectra of tumor suppressor genes Rb, APC, MCC in esophageal epithelium cells of human and monkey treated with NMBzA were also found in some human primary EC. The correlation observed in the mutation spectra of multiple tumor suppressor genes between human primary EC and the esophageal epithelia of human and monkey origin treated with NMBzA wouldsuggest that NMBzA may be the esophageal etiological agent for human esophageal cancer in China.",M1
7812947,"Tumor progression and loss of heterozygosity at 5q and 18q in non-small cell lung cancer.We investigated the frequency and clinical significance of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC, <e>MCC</e>, and DCC tumor suppressor gene loci in 108 cases of resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LOH at the APC/MCC gene cluster at chromosome 5q21 occurred frequently; it affected 29% of informative NSCLC cases and correlated with a significantly worse survival (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, in the subtype most frequently affected (SCC), LOH at 5q not only correlated with a worse survival but also tumor involvement of the mediastinal and/or hilar nodes. In contrast, LOH at the DCC locus at chromosome 18q was far less frequent, occurring in 14% of NSCLC cases, and it was not associated with advanced stage or prognosis. These data suggest that LOH at 5q has a role in determining tumor progression and survival in NSCLC, and may prove to be a clinically useful prognostic indicator.",M1
7656796,"[Mutation of tumor suppressor genes APC and <e>MCC</e> in human esophageal cancer]The mutation and deletion of APC, MCC genes in human esophageal cancer were analyzed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing assay.

One of adjacent non-tumor tissue was also found to have deletion at exon 12 of MCC. In PCR direct sequencing analysis, two of 10 cases of EC were found to contain APC gene mutation in exon 11, two of 7 cases of EC were found to contain MCC genes mutation in exon 12. The results confirmed that mutation of APC and MCC genes exists in human esophageal cancer. It gives new clues to the understanding of carcinogenesis of human esophageal cancer.

Allele loss of APC, DCC, p53 and RB1 in colorectal tumours has been reported previously using a variety of methods. However, not all workers used intragenic markers. We have used microsatellite polymorphisms which map within, or are closely linked to, these tumour-suppressor gene loci in order to determine whether these loci are indeed the targets for alteration in colorectal cancer. In addition, we have assayed two other tumour-suppressor genes, WT1 and NF1, to see whether they play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. The putative metastasis-suppressor gene, NM23, was also investigated since there have been conflicting reports about its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis. Allele loss was detected at the DCC (29%), p53 (66%), RB1 (50%) and NF1 (14%) loci and in the APC/MCC region (50%), but not at the WT1 or NM23 loci. These rapid, and mostly gene-specific, fluorescent multiplex PCR assays for allele loss detection could be modified to devise a single molecular diagnostic test for the important lesions in colorectal cancer.",M1

8061582,"Loss of heterozygosity affecting the APC and <e>MCC</e> genetic loci in patients with primary breast carcinomas.Tumor suppressor genes APC and MCC were identified recently, and their chromosomal location was ascribed to chromosome 5q21. Mutations in the APC gene give rise to familial adenomatous polyposis and occur in many perhaps even the majority, of sporadic colon cancers. Loss of heterozygosity has been described in other human tumors such as lung and esophageal cancers. Here we show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 87 patients with breast cancer for the APC and/or MCC loci using a polymerase chain reaction-LOH assay. LOH affected loci in APC exons 11 and 15 in 9 of 35 (25%) and 4 of 34 (11%) heterozygous patients, respectively. LOH at the MCC exon 10 locus occurred in 7 of 40 (17%) informative samples.

8071957,"Adenomatous polyposis coli and a cytogenetic deletion of chromosome 5 resulting from a maternal intrachromosomal insertion.We present the clinical and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism. A high risk of colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5)(q15q22.3), was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the <e>MCC</e> and APC genes confirmed by molecular analysis. Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient. She was profoundly mentally retarded, autistic, and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions. The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion (dir ins(5)(q22.3q14.2q15)) found in the patient's mother. This family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both MCC and APC genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22.1 subband.",M1

No changes which may alter the amino acid sequences of these genes were detected, suggesting that these genes are not associated with the susceptibility to HNPCC. Only one of nine HNPCC cancers showed mutations in the MCC and p53 genes on the same analysis. Loss of heterozygosity in chromosomes 5q, 17p, 18q and 22 was detected in four of the nine cancers, all of them being positive as to metastasis to lymph nodes. Abnormalities of the (CA)n repeat were found in six cancers, including all four without metastasis. These data indicate that tumor suppressor genes in chromosomes 5q, 17p, 18q and 22 are associated with the late stage of colorectal tumorigenesis in HNPCC, whereas the (CA)n repeat abnormalities are an early event of tumorigenesis and more essential to HNPCC.",M1
8080684,"Loss of heterozygosity of tumour suppressor gene loci in human colorectal carcinoma.We used Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques to examine deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci in 91 primary colorectal tumours. The tumour suppressor genes studied were <e>MCC</e> and APC on chromosome 5q, p53 on chromosome 17p, DCC on chromosome 18q, and the putative suppressor gene nm23-H1 on chromosome 17q. The most frequent allelic loss observed was in chromosome 17p with 76% (68/89) of informative tumours showing loss of heterozygosity at this locus, followed by 34% (19/55) for DCC, 31% (12/39) for MCC, 17% (9/53) for APC and 16% (3/19) for nm23.

8032525,"Analysis of genetic alterations in renal cell carcinoma using the polymerase chain reaction.Very frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 3p has been found in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the present study, we examined LOH at the retinoblastoma (RB), mutated in colorectal cancer (<e>MCC</e>) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor genes loci, and mutations of the H-, K-, and N-ras oncogenes. We performed these studies using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses. LOH was detected in 2 of 11 (18.2%), and 2 of 14 (14.3%) informative cases at the MCC and APC loci, respectively, and in none of 15 informative cases at the RB locus in 25 RCCs. LOH at the MCC was accompanied by LOH at the APC locus in two RCCs. No mutation was detected in H-, K-, and N-ras genes in 39 RCCs. Thus, alterations of the known tumour suppressor genes and the ras oncogenes were infrequent events in RCC. The results suggest that the genetic pathway in the genesis of RCC differs considerably from that of other common human carcinomas.",M1
8224634,"Exclusion of APC and <e>MCC</e> as the gene defect in one family with familial juvenile polyposis.BACKGROUND: In familial juvenile polyposis, multiple juvenile polyps occur throughout the colon. The genetic defect has not been characterized. The risk of colon cancer is increased, although the magnitude of the increased risk is controversial. The hypothesis of this study was that the genetic defect is within a tumor suppressor gene, possibly one already known to be inactivated in colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: Linkage analysis using the short tandem repeat polymorphism D5S346 was performed to determine if juvenile polyposis was linked to either APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) or MCC (mutated in colorectal carcinoma) genes within a single large family. RESULTS: A family in which eight subjects have been affected by juvenile polyposis over three generations is described. Six affected subjects had colectomies in childhood, but the two who have so far survived beyond 35 years of age have developed adenocarcinoma of the jejunum. Within this family, linkage analysis excluded linkage of the juvenile polyposis trait to either APC or MCC. CONCLUSIONS: In a family with juvenile polyposis with a clear predisposition to malignancy, including carcinoma of the jejunum, APC and MCC were not the defective genes causing the condition.",M1
8249174,"Genetic events responsible for colorectal tumorigenesis: achievements and challenges.Colorectal carcinogenesis is a multistep process that is accompanied by accumulation of changes in proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. APC/<e>MCC</e>, RAS, DCC, p53 mutations and/or allelic losses, hyperexpression of c-MYC and RB genes, as well as other genomic alterations appear at characteristic stages of tumor development and are observed in most neoplasms. However, consideration of each of these abnormalities leaves many unanswered questions. The striking data on recurrent amplification of the RB tumor-suppressor gene as well as suppressive activities of protein kinase C and activated RAS genes, at least in some colon carcinoma cell lines, suggest the unusual effects of some signalling pathways in colonic epithelial cells. The results obtained to date indicate that distinct sets of genetic changes may underlie the development of colorectal tumors.",M1

DNA from one patient showed a rearranged pattern which was interpreted as evidence for an inversion of approximately 150 kb, changing the transcriptional orientation of the neighbouring MCC gene and bringing it closer to APC. Such an interpretation was supported by fluorescent in situ hybridization data.",M1

In this study, we analyzed nine cases of primary HCC without cirrhosis using probes from the MCC and APC genes, which are in the region 5q21-22. None of the informative cases had allele loss detected by these probes, whereas the probe lambda MS8 for the region 5q35-qter showed allele loss in six out of six informative cases. The results confirm that the putative tumor suppressor gene for HCC without cirrhosis on chromosome 5q is distinct from the MCC and APC genes.",M1
1668888,"Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in familial polyposis coli patients and sporadic colorectal tumors.We have isolated several genes in the chromosome 5q21 region tightly linked to hereditary familial polyposis coli (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome (GS). Two of these genes (<e>MCC</e> and APC) were found to be somatically altered by point mutation, deletion or insertion in tumors of sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of them (adenomatous polyposis coli; APC) was also found to mutate in the germ-line of both APC and GS patients. The identification of these genes has significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and for the diagnosis and counseling of individuals with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer. Furthermore, in one colon carcinoma, we identified an interesting mechanism causing dysfunction of the APC gene. This gene was disrupted by a somatic insertion of a long interspersed repetitive element (LINE-1 sequence: L1) into the last exon. As an insertional sequence contains a 3' portion of the L1 consensus sequence including the poly(A) tract and an 8 bp target-site duplication was observed, this insertion is suspected to be caused by a retrotranscriptional insertion of one of the L1 sequences. This is the first case of the disruption of a tumor suppressor gene by the insertion of a movable genetic element.",M1
20418670,"New insights into merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare aggressive cutaneous malignancy of the elderly and immunocompromised populations. The clinical presentation of MCC is nonspecific, with the majority of cases presenting as localized skin involvement. Histologically and immunophenotypically, MCC is defined by both neuroendocrine and epithelial differentiation. Recently, the Merkel cell polyomavirus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC. In addition, there have been numerous studies evaluating the histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of MCC as they relate to diagnosis and prognosis. The purpose of this paper is to review the most salient and clinically relevant updates in the pathogenesis and histologic features of MCC. Specific attention is given to the clinical and histologic predictors of prognosis, staging, and the controversies concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy and therapy.",M2

20214170,"Management of Merkel cell carcinoma with emphasis on small primary tumors--a case series and review of the current literature.A case series of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is reported here and illustrates some of the current controversies in clinical management of this disease. From 1988-2007, 145 cases (74 men and 71 women) were analyzed. These were combined with other cases in the literature, hence the total number of patients was 433. Nodal metastases occurred clinically at presentation in 9/105 (9%) patients with primary tumor size &lt;1 cm. The rate of nodal metastases is too high to obviate sentinel node biopsies even for these small tumors. For the 87 patients with intermediate tumor size (&gt;1 - &lt;2 cm), nodal metastases occurred clinically in 11 of 87 patients (13%) at presentation and 23 of 87 patients (26%) during follow-up. Distant metastases occurred in 20 of 87 patients (23%) only at follow-up. The risks of nodal and distant failures for tumors of intermediate sizes were sufficient to be classified as high-risk for clinical study purposes.",M2
20162707,"Radiation monotherapy as regional treatment for lymph node-positive Merkel cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND:: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an aggressive cutaneous malignancy with a high risk of lymph node involvement. To the authors' knowledge, few data have been published to date regarding the optimal regional therapy for lymph node-positive patients. This cohort study was performed to analyze the outcomes of patients with lymph node-positive MCC treated with lymph node irradiation as definitive therapy compared with completion lymphadenectomy (CLND). METHODS:: Fifty patients with lymph node involvement of MCC at presentation and adequate follow-up data were included in this analysis. Forty-three of these patients were enrolled and followed prospectively. Twenty-six patients presented with microscopic lymph node disease, and 24 patients presented with palpable lymph node involvement. RESULTS:: Regional control for patients with microscopically involved lymph nodes was 100% regardless of treatment modality-definitive lymph node irradiation (n = 19) or CLND +/- radiotherapy (n = 7) with median follow-up of 18 months. Patients with clinically positive lymph nodes had 2-year regional recurrence-free survival rate of 78% and 73% in the definitive lymph node irradiation (n = 9) and CLND +/- radiotherapy (n = 15) groups, respectively (P = .8) with a median follow-up of 16 months. CONCLUSIONS:: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest series published to date of radiation monotherapy as regional treatment for lymph node-positive MCC. Lymph node irradiation alone to positive regional lymph nodes was found to confer an excellent regional control rate that was comparable to CLND for both microscopic and palpable lymph node disease. There was no difference noted with regard to overall survival. Given their similar efficacy, the choice between these lymph node therapies may be based on the clinical scenario and anticipated side effect profiles. Cancer 2010.

20159312,"Epidermotropic Merkel cell carcinoma: a case series with histopathologic examination.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), an aggressive malignancy that has been increasing in incidence, rarely presents with an epidermotropic pattern. OBJECTIVE: We conducted an immunohistochemical evaluation of 6 previously unpublished cases of epidermotropic MCC, focusing particularly on the staining characteristics of epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin-20 in the hope of providing insight into the mechanism of epidermotropism in MCC. METHODS: This study is a retrospective evaluation using light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Forty cases of MCC with pathology at Rhode Island Hospital and the Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, from 1983 through 2009 were reviewed. Following exclusion criteria, 6 patients (5 men, 1 woman) with a mean age of 82.5 years (range, 72-92) demonstrated epidermotropism. Three of 6 patients had MCC of the eyelid. In cases 1, 3, and 6, the perinuclear dot pattern observed with cytokeratin-20 in the epidermotropic MCC cells was less pronounced than the pattern observed in the dermis, and in all 6 of the tumors, the epidermal staining pattern observed with epithelial membrane antigen was not more or less prominent than the staining observed in the dermis. LIMITATIONS: The small total number of cases of epidermotropic MCC is a limitation. CONCLUSION: The data presented reinforce the differential diagnosis of tumors with an epidermotropic growth pattern and the importance of immunohistochemical staining in the histologic workup of such tumors: squamous cell carcinoma in situ, melanoma, mycosis fungoides, eccrine porocarcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid, mammary and extramammary Paget disease, MCC, and epidermotropic metastases. It is notable that 3 of 6 identified tumors were located on the eyelid; further study of epidermotropic MCC may shed more light on this finding, either as an unusual coincidence or a finding with unexplained significance.",M2
20096162,"Toward better management of merkel cell carcinoma using a consensus staging system, new diagnostic codes and a recently discovered virus.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a neuroendocrine skin cancer with a higher propensity for recurrence and metastasis than melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Despite aggressive behavior and the tripling of its reported incidence in the past 20 years, there is extensive confusion about how MCC should be managed. Here we address two issues that have impeded optimal MCC management: lack of a consensus staging system and lack of unique diagnostic codes for MCC. Five conflicting systems currently used to stage MCC will be replaced by one system in 2010 that will diminish confusion about prognosis and management among physicians and patients. The diagnostic bundling of MCC with numerous less aggressive skin cancers leads to care refusals by insurance and an inability to track MCC care costs. Worldwide adoption in 2009 of specific diagnostic codes for MCC will also improve understanding and management of this often-lethal skin cancer.",M2

The purpose of this study was to examine recent incidence trends for these cancers from 1990 to 2005 using the population-based Swedish National Cancer Registry. SCC incidence increased significantly over the study period and increased sharply with age. MCC incidence increased significantly for men for tumors at sun-exposed sites, and increased sharply with age. DFSP incidence was similar for sun-exposed and covered sites and decreased significantly only at exposed sites. A combination of behavioral, biological, and environmental factors likely explains the trends observed for these skin cancers.",M2
20082888,"The impact of (18)F-FDG PET-CT scanning for staging and management of Merkel cell carcinoma: results from Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare cutaneous malignancy with high mortality. Positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been shown to be valuable in the management of many types of cancer, and the purpose of this work was to determine its utility for patients with MCC. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of (18)F-FDG PET with simultaneous computed tomography (PET-CT) on the staging and management of patients with MCC. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with MCC who underwent 21 PET-CT scans at our institution from 2006 to 2008. The impact of PET-CT on staging and management plans were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 12 men and 6 women with median age of 79 years (range, 54 to 85 years). All proven sites of MCC greater than 5 mm were positive on PET-CT with average maximum standardized uptake values (SUV max) of 4 in primary lesions, 5.6 in nodal disease and 11.5 in distant metastases. PET-CT contributed to altered staging in 7 patients (33%) and a change in management in 9 patients (43%). Two patients were found to have a second primary malignancy, but this did not alter management. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective review. Most patients had stage II or III disease, suggesting some potential referral bias. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-FDG PET-CT had a high impact in the management of MCC patients in our series and this investigation merits further assessment.",M2
20061203,"Second cancers following the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma: a nationwide cohort study.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. MCCs and some other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinomas, frequently harbour Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA. The purpose of the study was to investigate the frequency of second cancers following the diagnosis of MCC. We studied the incidence of second primary cancers after the diagnosis of MCC from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1979-2006. Among the 172 MCC patients identified a total of 34 second primary cancers were detected in 30 individuals after the diagnosis of MCC. Female MCC patients were diagnosed with 25 subsequent cancers (SIR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.52-3.47; p&lt;0.001) and male patients with 9 cancers (SIR, 2.32, 95% CI, 1.06-4.40; p&lt;0.05). The MCC patients had an increased risk for a subsequent cancer (any site) compared to age-, gender- and calendar period-matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-3.27). The risks for basal cell carcinoma of the skin (O=11), SIR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.74-6.22 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (O=2), SIR, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.16-64.6 were significantly elevated. The SIRs for an overall second primary cancer risk did not change markedly with time since the diagnosis of MCC. We conclude that patients diagnosed with MCC have an increased risk for a second cancer. This risk may in part result from shared etiological factors between MCC and other tumour types, such as immunosuppression or possibly Merkel cell polyomavirus infection.",M2
20016500,"Inflammatory monocytes are a reservoir for Merkel cell polyomavirus.Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a recently discovered virus that is implicated in the oncogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). The route of dissemination and the reservoir(s) of MCPyV within the human body have not yet been identified. In this study we describe two patients with multiple MCPyV-positive inflammatory and neoplastic skin lesions at different anatomic sites. Patient 1 was suffering from psoriasis for many years and was diagnosed with MCC 7 years before this study. Patient 2 had developed numerous non-melanoma skin cancer lesions under post-transplant immunosuppression. In both patients, MCPyV DNA was detected in whole blood and in urine using PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products. When we analyzed different blood compartments, we found MCPyV exclusively in cell-free serum and in blood monocytes, but not in lymphocytes or granulocytes. Upon separate analysis of resident (CD14(lo)CD16(+)) and inflammatory (CD14(+)CD16(-)) monocytes, we detected MCPyV exclusively in inflammatory, but not in resident monocytes. Our findings raise the possibility that MCPyV persists in inflammatory monocytes and spreads along the migration routes of inflammatory monocytes. This points to intervention strategies to contain MCPyV. Moreover, blood or urine tests may serve as ancillary tests to confirm MCPyV infection in a clinical setting.",M2
20007099,"Merkel cell carcinoma with an unusual immunohistochemical profile.The clinical and morphological picture of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) may be rather challenging; therefore, the immunohistochemical profile plays a relevant role in confirming the microscopic diagnosis. A panel of antibodies including cytokeratins 20, 7 and epithelial membrane antigen, and neuron specific enolase is used in confirming the morphological diagnosis of MCC. The majority of MCCs express CK20 and are CK7-negative. Herein, we present a case of primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma with an atypical immunohistochemical pattern. A 83-years old woman presented with a painless plaque, red to violaceous in colour, located in the leg. The skin tumor was excided, formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded. Tissue sections were immunostained with a panel of antibodies routinely utilized in complex primary skin tumors for evidencing epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor cells. The neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor cells was evidenced by their immunoreactivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. Tumor cells also showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining for CK7. No immunoreactivity was detected for CK20 and thyroid transcription factor-1. Our data, together with previous rare reports of CK20-/CK7+ MCCs, lay stress on the importance of routinely utilizing a panel of antibodies in the differential diagnosis of complex primary carcinomas of the skin and may have important implications in expanding the differential diagnosis of skin tumors. In particular, caution should be taken in excluding the diagnosis of MCC only on the basis of the absence of reactivity of tumor cells for CK20, favouring the wrong diagnosis of less aggressive skin tumors.",M2
20005143,"[Management of Merkel cell carcinoma: Role of radiotherapy in elderly patients]PURPOSE: Merkel cell carcinoma carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) or primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy affecting elderly. Optimal therapeutic strategy has not yet been established in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1996 to March 2007, 29 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma of were treated at the University Hospital of Amiens, France. Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was performed for 14 patients (50%) on the tumor bed with margins of 3 to 5cm, an average dose of 46Gy (30-60Gy), by 2Gy per fraction. Ten of them also received RT to the lymph node area at mean dose of 44.3Gy (26-50Gy). Duration of RT was 35 days. A retrospective analysis was conducted to better evaluate survival and prognostic factors. RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 18.9 months (3-122) and the median time to progression (MTP) 5.5 months (1-26). At 5 years, OS for irradiated patients was 47% (IC95: 12-82%) versus 27% (IC95: 5-49%) in cases of surgery alone (p=0.032). The most frequent sites of recurrence were nodal (34.5%), local (24.1%) and metastatic (17.2%). For patients over 70 years, eight (36.5%) were free of disease at last news, 8 (36.5%) had died from cancer and six from other causes (27%). In this subgroup, MTP was 6 months (2-19) and median OS of 19 months (4-87). There was no acute toxicity greater than grade 2. CONCLUSION: Although limited by a retrospective analysis, this report suggests an advantage of postoperative RT for patients with MCC. It combined low toxicity and improvement of survival. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to clarify and validate the optimal strategy.",M2
19967613,"[Young patient with eyelid Merkel carcinoma: Mohs microsurgery versus exenteration]CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 47-year-old female suffering from progeria who developed an eyelid Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) following cyclosporine treatment for a corneal transplant. She underwent excision of the lesion by Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) and received adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy. Later she had a recurrent tumour for which a wide excision with orbital exenteration was performed. The patient was fit and well at the 24-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: MCC is an aggressive tumour that has a larger incidence in elderly people, women and immunosuppressed patients. Our approach with the patient must be global, avoiding risk factors in predisposed subjects. MMS seems unsuitable for the treatment of MCC; if tumour recurrence occurs a wide resection should be performed (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2009; 84: 581-584).",M2
19921252,"Expression of MMP-10, MMP-21, MMP-26, and MMP-28 in Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an aggressive cutaneous tumor with poor outcome and increasing incidence. We examined by immunohistochemistry the expression of three novel matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-MMP-21, MMP-26, and MMP-28-in 44 primary MCC tumors and six lymph node metastases while MMP-10 served as a positive control. Their mRNA expression was also studied in the UISO MCC cell line basally and after various stimulations using quantitative real-time PCR. MMP-28 was observed in tumor cells of 15/44 samples especially in tumors &lt;2 cm in diameter (p = 0.015) while 21/44 specimens showed MMP-28 in the tumor stroma. Expression of MMP-21 was demonstrated in tumor cells of 13/43 samples. MMP-26, instead, was positive in stromal cells (17/44) and its expression associated with tumors &gt;or=2 cm in diameter (p = 0.006). Stromal expression of MMP-10 was the most frequent finding of the studied samples (31/44), but MMP-10 was detected also in tumor cells (17/44). Most of the metastatic lymph nodes expressed MMP-10 and MMP-26. MMP-10, MMP-21, and MMP-28 mRNAs were basally expressed by the UISO cells, and the corresponding proteins were detectable by immunostaining of cultured cells. IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha downregulated MMP-21 and MMP-28 expression. Our results suggest that novel MMPs may have a role in MCC pathogenesis: especially that MMP-26 expression in stroma is associated with larger tumors with poor prognosis. Expression of MMP-21 and MMP-28 seems to associate with the tumors of lesser malignant potential. We also confirm the previous finding on the role of MMP-10 in MCC pathogenesis.",M2
19916967,"Role of definitive radiotherapy in treating patients with inoperable Merkel cell carcinoma: the Westmead Hospital experience and a review of the literature.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an uncommon aggressive primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma with a propensity to spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. The head and neck is the commonest site for presentation (50-60%) and recent evidence suggests patients treated with excision (to achieve a negative microscopic margin) and adjuvant wide-field radiotherapy (RTx) have an improved survival compared with surgery alone. Surgery is often not possible in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities and in patients with advanced lesions. Definitive RTx therefore remains an option in these inoperable patients, with data to report its benefit. We report the results of eight patients with inoperable MCC treated with RTx alone between 1993 and 2007 at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia, and also review the relevant literature on definitive RTx in the treatment of MCC. The median age at diagnosis was 82.5 years in five women and three men. All patients were Caucasian and none were immunosuppressed. Seven of eight patients were clinically node-positive. The mean duration of follow up was 12 months. A median dose of 50 Gy was prescribed. Seven of eight patients with inoperable MCC achieved in-field control, with most eventually relapsing distantly. Treatment-related toxicity was acceptable. In keeping with our results, other studies also report high rates of in-field locoregional control following RTx alone. These findings highlight the radioresponsiveness of advanced MCC and support a recommendation of moderate-dose RTx alone in select cases. Lower-dose palliative dose fractionation schedules (e.g. 25 Gy in five fractions) may be considered in patients of very poor performance status.",M2
19906498,"Effect of radiotherapy dose and volume on relapse in Merkel cell cancer of the skin.PURPOSE: To assess the effect of radiotherapy (RT) dose and volume on relapse patterns in patients with Stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 112 patients diagnosed with MCC between January 2000 and December 2005 and treated with curative-intent RT. RESULTS: Of the 112 evaluable patients, 88% had RT to the site of primary disease for gross (11%) or subclinical (78%) disease. Eighty-nine percent of patients had RT to the regional lymph nodes; in most cases (71%) this was for subclinical disease in the adjuvant or elective setting, whereas 21 patients (19%) were treated with RT to gross nodal disease. With a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 72% and 53%, respectively, and the 2-year locoregional control rate was 75%. The in-field relapse rate was 3% for primary disease, and relapse was significantly lower for patients receiving &gt;or=50 Gy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.86). Surgical margins did not affect the local relapse rate. The in-field relapse rate was 11% for RT to the nodes, with dose being significant for nodal gross disease (HR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.87). Patients who did not receive elective nodal RT had a much higher rate of nodal relapse compared with those who did (HR = 6.03; 95% CI, 1.34-27.10). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a dose-response for subclinical and gross MCC. Doses of &gt;or=50 Gy for subclinical disease and &gt;or=55 Gy for gross disease should be considered. The draining nodal basin should be treated in all patients.",M2
19809278,"Merkel cell polyomavirus: a specific marker for Merkel cell carcinoma in histologically similar tumors.The recently described Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is reportedly present in 50% to 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas (<e>MCC</e>). Although the virus has been shown to be absent from other cutaneous neoplasms, its association with malignancies that are histologically similar to MCC, specifically small cell carcinoma of the lung and other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address this issue, we identified a set of 74 cases of visceral high-grade neuroendocrine tumors from a variety of anatomic sites, including 32 cases from the lung, 16 cases from the gastrointestinal tract, 20 cases from the female reproductive system, 3 cases from soft tissue, 2 cases from the head and neck region, and 1 case from the bladder. Using a set of primers optimized to detect MCPyV in formalin-fixed tissue, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing showed evidence of MCPyV DNA in only 1 of the 74 tumors; however, clinicopathologic review of the positive case (a neuroendocrine tumor of the small intestine) disclosed that the patient had a history of primary MCC of the buttock. PCR-based testing also showed no evidence of the related WU and KI polyomaviruses in the set of 74 cases. We conclude that, when evaluated by PCR-based testing, MCPyV is a specific marker for MCC that can be helpful in distinguishing cases of metastatic MCC from other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. Our results also suggest that MCPyV does not have a role in the oncogenesis of visceral high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.",M2

19755994,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients have a high risk of Merkel-cell polyomavirus DNA-positive Merkel-cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression and Merkel-cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection may have a role in the pathogenesis of Merkel-cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. METHODS: We studied incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and MCC from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry and the largest hospital of Finland, Helsinki University Central Hospital, from 1979 to 2006. Presence of MCPyV DNA in MCCs was investigated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We identified 4164 patients diagnosed with CLL and 172 diagnosed with MCC. Six patients diagnosed with both diseases were found; CLL was the first diagnosis in four cases and MCC in two. The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for CLL after the diagnosis of MCC was highly elevated, 17.9 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.2-64.6; P&lt;0.001), and the SIR for MCC after the diagnosis of CLL was also elevated, 15.7 (3.2-46.0, P&lt;0.01). Merkel-cell polyomavirus DNA was present in all five MCCs with tumour tissue available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients diagnosed with CLL have a substantially increased risk for MCC, and vice versa. Merkel-cell polyomavirus DNA is frequently present in MCCs that occur in CLL patients. Immunosuppression related with CLL and viral infection might explain the association between CLL and MCC.",M2
19750217,"Quantitation of human seroresponsiveness to Merkel cell polyomavirus.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a relatively uncommon but highly lethal form of skin cancer. A majority of MCC tumors carry DNA sequences derived from a newly identified virus called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV), a candidate etiologic agent underlying the development of MCC. To further investigate the role of MCV infection in the development of MCC, we developed a reporter vector-based neutralization assay to quantitate MCV-specific serum antibody responses in human subjects. Our results showed that 21 MCC patients whose tumors harbored MCV DNA all displayed vigorous MCV-specific antibody responses. Although 88% (42/48) of adult subjects without MCC were MCV seropositive, the geometric mean titer of the control group was 59-fold lower than the MCC patient group (p&lt;0.0001). Only 4% (2/48) of control subjects displayed neutralizing titers greater than the mean titer of the MCV-positive MCC patient population. MCC tumors were found not to express detectable amounts of MCV VP1 capsid protein, suggesting that the strong humoral responses observed in MCC patients were primed by an unusually immunogenic MCV infection, and not by viral antigen expressed by the MCC tumor itself. The occurrence of highly immunogenic MCV infection in MCC patients is unlikely to reflect a failure to control polyomavirus infections in general, as seroreactivity to BK polyomavirus was similar among MCC patients and control subjects. The results support the concept that MCV infection is a causative factor in the development of most cases of MCC. Although MCC tumorigenesis can evidently proceed in the face of effective MCV-specific antibody responses, a small pilot animal immunization study revealed that a candidate vaccine based on MCV virus-like particles (VLPs) elicits antibody responses that robustly neutralize MCV reporter vectors in vitro. This suggests that a VLP-based vaccine could be effective for preventing the initial establishment of MCV infection.",M2
19739110,"Detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in Merkel cell carcinoma cell lines: cell morphology and growth phenotype do not reflect presence of the virus.The recently discovered human polyomavirus (MCPyV) is frequently found in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) tissue and is believed to be causally linked to MCC pathogenesis. While cell lines established from MCC represent a valuable tool to study the contribution of MCPyV to MCC pathogenesis, hitherto only 1 MCPyV-positive line has been described. We have analyzed 7 MCC cell lines for the presence, integration pattern and copy number of MCPyV. In 5 cell lines, MCPyV specific sequences were detected. In 3 of these lines, multiple copies of viral genomes per cell were detected, and sequencing of PCR amplificates identified distinct mutations predicted to lead to the expression of a truncated large T-Antigen (LT-Ag). In 1 cell line, clonal integration of concatamerized viral genomes was confirmed by Southern Blotting. MCC cell lines are conventionally categorized as  classic  or  variant  and further divided into 4 subtypes, based on expression of neuroendocrine markers and morphology. While it has been suggested that the presence of MCPyV might promote a classic phenotype, such a notion is not supported by our data. Instead, we find MCPyV-positive as well as -negative lines of the classic variety, indicating that the distinguishing features are either inherently independent of viral infection or have become so in the course of tumorigenesis and/or cell line establishment. We therefore suggest a novel classification scheme based on MCPyV presence, integration patterns and T-Ag mutations. The cell lines described here extend the repertoire of available MCPyV-positive MCC-lines and should aid in the elucidation of the role of MCPyV in the pathogenesis of MCC.",M2
19707243,"Neoadjuvant polychemotherapy in locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old man presented with a Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) of the left cheek with concomitant nodal spread. A 61-year-old man presented with an MCC of the right thigh with rapid nodal recurrence. INVESTIGATIONS: Skin biopsy samples proved the MCC nature of the neoplasm in both patients. Staging procedure included clinical and radiological investigations. DIAGNOSIS: Advanced stage II MCC. MANAGEMENT: Neoadjuvant cisplatin, etoposide and cyclophosphamide (EPC) regimen led to local control in the first patient and allowed curative surgery associated with adjuvant radiation therapy. Complete remission was maintained for 32 months. The second patient was treated by surgery plus radiation therapy. Nodal and cutaneous recurrences were treated with a neoadjuvant EPC regimen leading to a 5-year complete remission.",M2
19678822,"Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA detection in lesional and nonlesional skin from patients with Merkel cell carcinoma or other skin diseases.Background A novel polyomavirus, the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), has recently been identified in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). Objectives To investigate the specificity of this association through the detection, quantification and analysis of MCPyV DNA in lesional and nonlesional skin biopsies from patients with MCC or with other cutaneous diseases, as well as in normal skin from clinically healthy individuals. Methods DNA was extracted from lesional and nonlesional skin samples of patients with MCC or with other cutaneous diseases and from normal-appearing skin of clinically healthy subjects. MCPyV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantified by real-time PCR. Additionally, the T antigen coding region was sequenced in eight samples from seven patients. Results MCPyV DNA was detected in 14 of 18 (78%) patients with MCC, five of 18 (28%) patients with other skin diseases (P = 0.007) and one of six (17%) clinically healthy subjects. In patients with MCC, viral DNA was detected in nine of 11 (82%) tumours and in 10 of 14 (71%) nontumoral skin samples (P = 0.66). MCPyV DNA levels were higher in MCC tumours than in nontumoral skin from patients with MCC, and than in lesional or nonlesional skin from patients with other cutaneous disorders. Signature mutations in the T antigen gene were not identified in the two MCC tumour specimens analysed. Conclusions High prevalence and higher levels of MCPyV DNA in MCC supports a role for MCPyV in tumorigenesis. However, the high prevalence of MCPyV in the nontumoral skin and in subjects without MCC suggests that MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus.",M2
19655608,"Intraoperative imprint cytology for evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes from Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare, aggressive cutaneous malignancy. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IIC) can potentially avoid second operations for completion lymphadenectomy when nodal metastases are found during nodal staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN). This represents the first series of IIC for MCC we are aware of and our initial experience. Patients with biopsy-proven MCC underwent SLN (at the time of wide excision) using a double indicator technique with 99technetium sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue. SLN were identified and bisected and touch imprints of each half were made. One half was air-dried and stained with Diff-Quick and the other was fixed with 95 per cent alcohol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Paraffin-embedded sections were examined by H&amp;E. Eighteen patients underwent successful SLN mapping procedures. IIC was negative in 84.2 per cent (16) cases. Three false-negatives occurred with IIC, but there were no false-positives, making the sensitivity 33 per cent and the specificity 100 per cent. Two of four patients with positive pathology-confirmed SLN also had positive IIC. SLN mapping has usefulness in patients with MCC. IIC is feasible and accurate in evaluating the SLN. IIC is a practical diagnostic tool when intraoperative analysis of SLN biopsy is desired for MCC.",M2
19644931,"Expression of hedgehog signaling molecules in Merkel cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: The Hedgehog signaling pathway is important for human development and carcinogenesis in various malignancies. METHODS: One tissue microarray with triplets of 28 samples from 25 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) was constructed. Six samples of normal skin and 5 samples of normal oral mucosa served as controls. All samples were analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies directed against Sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, Patched, Smoothened, Gli-1, Gli-2, and Gli-3. RESULTS: All investigated proteins were frequently and intensely overexpressed in MCCs (Sonic hedgehog, 93%; Indian hedgehog, 84%; Patched, 86%; Smoothened, 79%; Gli-1, 79%; Gli-2, 79%; Gli-3, 86%) compared with control samples. High levels of Patched and Indian hedgehog were significantly associated with an increase in patients overall (p = .015) and recurrence-free survival (p = .011), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is strongly activated in MCC and thus may play a role in carcinogenesis.",M2

METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive patients were reviewed. Patients were treated by wide local excision. Clinically negative regional nodes were either followed up (n=42) or staged with sentinel lymph node biopsy (n=21), and clinically positive nodes underwent lymph node dissection (n=32). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 65 months. A total of 45 (47%) patients relapsed, with 80% of the recurrences occurring within 2 years and 96% within 5 years. The 5-year crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of recurrence and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 52% and 67%, respectively. CCI of local 5-year recurrence was 5% for the study cohort. Patients with MCC in the head and neck region had a 5-year local-recurrence CCI of 19%, and patients with MCC in the extremity and trunk region had a 5-year local-recurrence CCI of 2% (P=0.007). Comparing patients with &lt;or=2 versus &gt;2 metastatic lymph nodes, the 5-year regional-recurrence CCI was 0% versus 39% (P=0.004). The 5-year distant-recurrence CCI was higher in clinically node-positive patients compared with node-negative patients (37% versus 12%; P=0.005). Patients with MCC in the head and neck region experienced no distant recurrences, patients with MCC in the extremity and trunk region had a 5-year distant-recurrence CCI of 22%, and patients with occult primary had a 5-year distant-recurrence CCI of 49% (P=0.023). The 5-year DSS rate was 80% for pathologically node-negative patients. CONCLUSION: The prognosis for surgically managed early-stage MCC is variable. Thus multidisciplinary tumor-board consultation is needed to optimize individual patient management.",M2
19609205,"Merkel cell polyomavirus expression in merkel cell carcinomas and its absence in combined tumors and pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is the eponym for primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. Recently, a new polyoma virus has been identified that is clonally integrated in the genome of the majority of MCCs, with truncating mutations in the viral large T antigen gene. We examined the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) in a set of 17 frozen tumor samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction; 15 of them (88%) were positive. Sections from corresponding archival material were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with the novel monoclonal antibody CM2B4, generated against a predicted antigenic epitope on the MCV T antigen, and tested for the expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20). Sufficient archival material for IHC was available in only 15 of the 17 cases whose frozen tissue samples had been studied by polymerase chain reaction. Of the 15 tumors analyzed immunohistochemically, 10 (67%) showed positive labeling with CM2B4, 14 (93%) expressed CK20. A tissue microarray of 36 MCCs, 7 combined squamous and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the skin, and 26 pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas were also examined by IHC. Of the 36 MCCs assembled on a microarray, 32 (89%) tumors expressed CK20, and 27 (75%) were immunoreactive with CM2B4. The skin tumors with a combined squamous and neuroendocrine phenotype and all pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas failed to react with CM2B4. Our study shows that CM2B4 is a useful reagent for the diagnosis of MCC. It labels the majority of MCCs, but fails to react with pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas. We also found that neuroendocrine carcinomas of the skin arising in association with a squamous cell carcinoma seem to be independent of MCV.",M2
19597021,"Merkel cell carcinoma: recent progress and current priorities on etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management.PURPOSE: To expedite improved understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a rare malignancy of cutaneous neuroendocrine cells that has a 28% 2-year mortality rate. METHODS: This article summarizes a workshop that discussed the state-of-the-art research and priorities for research on MCC and on a new human polyomavirus (ie, MCPyV) recently discovered in 80% of MCC tumors. RESULTS: Normal Merkel cells are widely distributed in the epidermis near the end of nerve axons and may function as mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors. Malignant MCC cells typically stain for cytokeratin 20 as well as for other epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. MCC subtypes, which are based on histology, on cell line growth properties, and on gene expression profiles, have been reported but have not been linked to prognosis. Clinical management has been empiric. MCPyV is clonally integrated at various sites in the human genome of MCC tumors, with truncating mutations in the viral, large T antigen gene that interrupt viral replication. MCPyV seroprevalence may be high, as with previously known human polyomaviruses. MCC risk is increased 11-fold with AIDS and with other cell-mediated immune deficiencies, B-cell neoplasms, and ultraviolet radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: Development and validation of a range quantitative polymerase chain reaction and serologic assays for detection of MCPyV, as well as an infectious clone of the virus, would clarify the fundamental biology, natural history, and epidemiology of the virus, of MCC, and of other diseases. Contingent on standardized histologic diagnosis and staging of MCC, consortia are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant radiation therapy, and salvage therapies; consortia are needed also for epidemiologic studies of MCC etiology.",M2
19588496,"Quantitative detection of Merkel cell virus in human tissues and possible mode of transmission.Merkel Cell Virus (MCV) is a newly discovered polyomavirus, recently found in a rare skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). However, MCV has also been detected in some normal tissue samples. We tested and compared the relative quantity of the MCV in a set of diverse human tissue samples with the MCC samples. The levels of MCV in MCCs were over 60 times higher than the highest values in all other tissues. Low quantities of MCV were detected in diverse tissue samples independently of malignant or benign histologic status. Higher levels of the virus were found in the upper aerodigestive tract, digestive system, and saliva compared to the lung and genitourinary system samples. These results confirm that MCV is widespread in the human body and suggest a possible fecal-oral transmission route similar to the Hepatitis A virus. Despite widespread presence of the virus, it appears that only neuroendocrine skin cells are susceptible to transformation by MCV.",M2
19586970,"Incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma in renal transplant recipients.BACKGROUND: The risk factors for Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a rare type of skin cancer, are poorly understood. Some evidence suggests that MCC is more common in individuals with abnormal immune function resulting from viral infection, autoimmune disease or organ trans- plantation. METHODS: The national Renal Transplant Registry and the Finnish Cancer Registry data were searched for recipients of a renal transplant who were diagnosed with MCC. The MCC diagnoses were confirmed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Three cases of MCC were detected among 4200 individuals who underwent renal transplantation from 1967 to 2005 [expected number 0.05, standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 66, 95% CI 14-194, P &lt;0.001]. The latency period between the transplant and detection of MCC ranged from 6 to 19 years. In all three cases, the cause of transplantation was an autoimmune disease. All three died from aggressive MCC with a survival time ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the risk of MCC is greatly increased among subjects who have undergone renal transplantation. The course of the disease appears aggressive in this patient population. The physicians who treat recipients of a kidney transplant should be aware of the substantially increased risk of MCC.",M2
19581538,"Patients with Merkel cell carcinoma tumors &lt; or = 1.0 cm in diameter are unlikely to harbor regional lymph node metastasis.PURPOSE: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous malignancy. Current recommendations include offering regional lymph node evaluation by either sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or complete lymph node dissection (CLND) to all patients with MCC; however, we hypothesized a cohort of low-risk patients may exist for whom regional nodal metastasis would be unlikely. METHODS: A retrospective review of the Department of Veterans Affairs national health care database was performed. Patients undergoing resection of primary MCC were identified; and demographic, medical, and social history; tumor characteristics; nodal status; and recurrence events were recorded. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2006, 346 patients were diagnosed with MCC. Of these, 213 underwent resection of the primary lesion and evaluation of the draining lymph node basin. Fifty-four patients (25%) had tumors &lt; or = 1.0 cm in diameter. Average tumor diameter was 0.7 cm, and 63% were located on the head or neck. Only two patients (4%) with tumors &lt; or = 1.0 cm had regional lymph node metastasis, compared with 51 (24%) of 213 patients with tumors more than 1.0 cm (P &lt; .0001). Both patients had clinically evident nodal disease at presentation and underwent CLND. Both have remained recurrence-free for 40 months. Thirteen (25%) of 51 patients with nodal metastasis and tumors more than 1 cm had occult nodal metastasis. CONCLUSION: In this series, patients with MCC &lt; or = 1.0 cm were unlikely to have regional lymph node metastasis, suggesting that regional nodal evaluation may reasonably be avoided in these patients. However, these data support SLNB for MCC more than 1 cm in diameter.",M2

It has a higher incidence in immunosuppressed individuals such as organ transplant recipients and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) carriers. Recently, a newly described polyoma virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), was found in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a rare aggressive skin cancer also associated with immunosuppression. We hypothesized that MCPyV would be present in SCCs. To test for the presence of MCPyV in immunocompetent SCC patients, we used PCR primer sets directed against the large T (LT) antigen and VP1 gene of MCPyV. We detected MCPyV in 15% (26/177) of SCC DNA samples and 17% (11/63) of adjacent skin DNA samples from 21 of 58 (36%) individuals studied. We did not detect MCPyV in any matched normal blood DNA (0/57), but observed the presence of MCPyV DNA in 1 of 12 normal mouthwash DNAs. All sequenced SCC samples had a common mutation truncating the LT antigen that provides indirect evidence of viral integration. The presence of MCPyV in approximately 15% of SCCs from immunocompetent individuals warrants evaluation of MCPyV as an etiologic agent in the carcinogenesis of SCC.",M2

To investigate this heterogeneity, we developed a tissue microarray (TMA) to characterize immunohistochemical staining of candidate tumor cell proteins and a quantitative PCR assay to detect MCPyV and measure viral loads. MCPyV was detected in 19 of 23 (74%) primary MCC tumors, but 8 of these had less than 1 viral copy per 300 cells. Viral abundance of 0.06-1.2 viral copies/cell was directly related to presence of retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) by immunohistochemical staining (p &lt; or = 0.003). Higher viral abundance tumors tended to be associated with less p53 expression, younger age at diagnosis and longer survival (p &lt; or = 0.08).

Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare primary cutaneous epithelial neoplasm most commonly found in sun-exposed sites in elderly male Caucasians. A 66-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a purple painless 2 cm tumor on the scalp. Excision biopsy revealed an incompletely excised MCC, and at the periphery of the MCC, a lymphocytic infiltrate interpreted as reactive. A re-excision biopsy showed residual MCC as well as dense aggregates of small lymphocytes within and surrounding the MCC. Immunohistochemistry showed characteristic dot-like cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin 20 in the MCC; the lymphocytic infiltrate was positive for CD5, CD20 and CD23, diagnostic of CLL. Subsequent staging revealed widespread lymphadenopathy, and lymph node biopsy showed CLL. Histologically, CLL and MCC are 'round blue cell tumors' and are therefore in the differential diagnoses of each other. Whenever there is a more prominent than expected infiltrate of small lymphocytes surrounding a skin lesion in an elderly patient, immunohistochemistry to rule out CLL is advised. This case adds to the literature suggesting an increased incidence of CLL and other neoplasms in patients with MCC and vice versa.",M2

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 60 patients from 1986 to 2005 with a diagnosis of MCC of the lower limb or buttock were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were treated with curative intent with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, and RFS were 53%, 61%, and 20%, respectively. Factors influencing RFS were analyzed using univariate analysis. It appeared that recurrent disease worsened RFS (p = 0.03) and the addition of any radiotherapy improved RFS (p &lt;0.001), as did radiotherapy to the inguinal nodes (p = 0.01) or primary site and inguinal nodes (p = 0.003). Age, surgical margins, and stage were not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, the only significant factor was the addition of radiotherapy (hazard ratio = 0.51 p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The addition of radiotherapy improves RFS compared with surgery alone. Elective treatment should be given to the inguinal nodes to reduce the risk of relapse.",M2
19505415,"[Merkel cell carcinoma: an uncommon neuroendocrine cancer]Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), firstly described by Torker in 1972, is an uncommon and aggressive neuroendocrine cancer of the skin. MCC tends to recur and precociously spread to lymph nodes. Five-year survival rate is between 35 and 75%. In literature there are not univocal criteria regarding the diagnosis and therapy of MCC, probably due to its rarity. Surgery plays an important role in the therapeutic strategy of this cancer. Surgical excision must be wide and guarantee at least 2-3 cm of free tumor margins. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is useful to identify those patients in which extensive lymph node dissection and/or adjuvant therapies (radio- and/or chemotherapy) are advisable. We hereby report a case of MCC of the left arm in a 48 year-old male. A wide excision was performed with sentinel lymph node biopsy that did not show any metastasis.

MCV is a common human infection that can be detected by conformational capsid epitope immunoassays.Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a newly-discovered human tumor virus found in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). The rate of MCV infection among persons without MCC is unknown. We developed a MCV virus-like particle (VLP) enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) that does not cross-react with human BK or murine polyomaviruses. Peptide mapping of the MCV VP1 gene and immunoblotting with denatured MCV VLP are less sensitive than the MCV EIA in detecting MCV antibodies suggesting antibody reactivity in this assay primarily targets conformational but not linear epitopes. Among MCC patients, all 21 (100%) patients tested with MCV-positive tumors had high serum MCV IgG but not high MCV IgM levels. Only 3 of 6 (50%) MCC patients with MCV-negative tumors were positive for MCV antibodies. Sera from most adults, including 107 of 166 (64%) blood donors, 63 of 100 (63%) commercial donors and 37 of 50 (74%) systemic lupus erythematosus patients, show evidence for prior MCV exposure. Age-specific MCV prevalence was determined by examining a cross-sectional distribution of 150 Langerhans cell histiocytosis (an unrelated neoplasm) patient sera. MCV prevalence increases from 50% among children age 15 years or younger to 80% among persons older than 50 years. We did not find evidence for vertical transmission among infants. Although past exposure to MCV is common among all adult groups, MCC patients have a markedly elevated MCV IgG response compared with control patients.

MCV T antigen expression in Merkel cell carcinoma, lymphoid tissues and lymphoid tumors.Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a recently discovered human virus closely related to African green monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus. MCV DNA is integrated in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinomas (<e>MCC</e>), a neuroendocrine skin cancer linked to lymphoid malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To assess MCV infection and its association with human diseases, we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes endogenous and transfected MCV large T (LT) antigen. We show expression of MCV LT protein localized to nuclei of tumor cells from MCC having PCR quantified MCV genome at an average of 5.2 (range 0.8-14.3) T antigen DNA copies per cell. Expression of this putative viral oncoprotein in tumor cells provides the mechanistic underpinning supporting the notion that MCV causes a subset of MCC. In contrast, although 2.2% of 325 hematolymphoid malignancies surveyed also showed evidence for MCV infection by DNA PCR, none were positive at high viral copy numbers, and none of 173 lymphoid malignancies examined on tissue microarrays expressed MCV LT protein in tumor cells. As with some of the other human polyomaviruses, lymphocytes may serve as a tissue reservoir for MCV infection, but hematolymphoid malignancies associated with MCC are unlikely to be caused by MCV.",M2

It is associated with SV40 polyomaviral infection in other tumours. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection has been reported in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a neuroendocrine carcinoma with biological similarity to SCLC. In our study, we investigated polyomavirus infection (SV40 and MCPyV) and promoter hypermethylation of the tumour suppressors RASSF1A and p16 in 18 SCLCs (14 primaries and 4 regional lymph node metastases) and 18 blood control samples. MCPyV was found in 39% (7 of 18) of the tumour tissues but not observed in controls. SV40 was not observed in the tumour tissue. RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation (94%; 17 of 18) was more frequent compared to p16 methylation (56%, 10 of 18). We found no significant correlation between RASSF1A or p16 promoter hypermethylation and infection with the investigated polyoma viruses.

METHODS: In this pilot study, we studied skin specimens of eight patients with MCC. As a control, eight patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) were included. Immunohistochemistry was performed for MCM4, MCM6, MCM7, Ki-67, p53, and p21. RESULTS: Protein expression of MCM4 (66.0 +/- 26.5% vs. 33.9 +/- 22.4%; P = 0.017), MCM6 (70.9 +/- 11.9 vs. 31.7 +/- 22.7; P = 0.0031), and MCM7 (76.5 +/- 16.4% vs. 34.9 +/- 25.5%; P = 0.0013) was significantly increased in tumour cells of MCC when compared to tumour cells of MM. Ki-67 immunoreactivity was also significantly higher in MCC than in MM (28.7 +/- 7.9 vs. 11.0 +/- 9.2; P = 0.0012). Immunolabelling of p53 (68.6 +/- 26.2 vs. 58.4 +/- 28.8; P = 0.46) and p21 (40.1 +/- 38.8 vs. 25.8 +/- 16.1; P = 0.35) was relatively high but not significantly increased in MCC when compared to MM.

19438857,"Detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA in Merkel cell carcinomas.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare, aggressive tumour for which an increasing incidence has been reported. A new human polyomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), was recently isolated from these tumours by applying digital transcriptome subtraction methodology. OBJECTIVES: To detect the presence or absence of MCV in MCCs and other, randomly selected neoplasms. METHODS: Nine primary or recurrent MCCs from seven patients were examined; 29 other tumours (squamous cell, basal cell and basosquamous carcinomas and malignant melanomas) were examined for comparative purposes. Viral large T protein (LT1 and LT3), and viral capsid protein (VP1) were detected by primer-directed amplification, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method, and the amplified PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequence analysis. RESULTS: The presence of viral T antigen and/or viral capsid DNA sequences was demonstrated in seven of the eight MCC lesions. None of the comparative samples contained MCV DNA.

To date, the origin of the tumour cells still remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The present study analyses prognostic factors of MCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 57 patients with MCC treated between 1988 and 2006 at the Department of Dermatology in Tübingen were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 26 (45.6%) male and 31 (54.4%) female patients with MCC; the age at diagnosis ranged from 26 to 97 years (median 71 years). Primary tumours were located mainly on the head and neck areas (27 cases, 47.4%) and upper extremities (14 cases, 24.6%); 11 tumours were found on the lower extremities (19.3%) and four lesions on the chest (7%); one patient had an unknown primary location. Forty-five (78.9%) patients were diagnosed at stage I of the disease, 11 (19.3%) at stage II, and one patient (1.8%) at stage III at initial presentation. Stage of the disease and age at initial presentation were statistically significant with regard to overall (P &lt; 0.0001; P = 0.0327) and tumour-specific survival (P &lt; 0.0001; P = 0.0156). Use of the Cox regression model revealed initial stage of the disease as the only significant factor in the multivariate analysis. Radiotherapy applied promptly after excision of the primary tumour extended the time to progression significantly (P = 0.0376) but did not prolong overall or tumour-specific survival. Other parameters such as sex, site of tumour, sentinel node biopsy, excision margins, skin and noncutaneous malignancies were found to be not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, early recognition of the disease seems to be the only method of ensuring overall survival. However, evidence-based treatment modalities are still urgently needed.",M2
19405321,"Merkel cell carcinoma metastasis to the iris in a 23 year old female.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy which predominantly affects elderly caucasians. The pathogenesis is poorly understood but ultraviolet light and immunosuppression have both been implicated. MCC most commonly arises on sun exposed areas of the head and neck or extremities and has a propensity for local recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis. It may present as a violaceous or non specific firm nodule or as a small plaque. Histological diagnosis can be difficult and electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry are frequently required in addition to light microscopy. Management is stage dependant and frequently involves wide surgical excision with or without chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and complete surgical excision is associated with a favourable prognosis. However, aggressive tumours with regional recurrence or distant metastases result in a median survival of 9 months. Reports of primary MCC of the eyelids have been reported in the literature. Intra-ocular metastases to the choroid and ciliary body have also been reported.",M2
19401065,"Merkel cell carcinoma: a review of current advances.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare but aggressive cutaneous malignancy of neuroendocrine origin. Its incidence has tripled over the past 15 years. This article reviews the recent advancement in diagnosis, discoveries in pathogenesis, and updates in management. The acronym, AEIOU, has been proposed to aid in clinical identification. In addition to cytokeratin 20, newer immunohistochemical stains (in particular thyroid transcription factor-1 and neurofilament protein) have proven to be essential in pathologic diagnosis. Although immune suppression and ultraviolet radiation have long been associated with the MCC oncogenesis, recent studies also show involvement of a new polyomavirus and bcl-2. Several tumor classifications have been published in the literature, with the 4-tiered system from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center the most widely used. A similar classification with additional distinctions among nodal disease is being constructed. A multidisciplinary treatment algorithm is recommended for MCC. Surgical excision with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is indicated for localized tumors. RT is favored over complete lymph node dissection and chemotherapy for regional lymph node involvement. For distant metastasis, management should be individualized with a combination of palliative surgery, RT, and chemotherapy.",M2
19400830,"Molecular pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer which is twice as lethal as melanoma as more than one-third of MCC patients will die from this cancer. Although MCC, which primarily affects elderly and immune suppressed individuals, is very rare to date, its incidence is rapidly increasing. In contrast to the immense progress that has been made in the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of other cancer entities, until recently there were no clear-cut indications which events drive the carcinogenesis of MCC. Important findings published last year have changed this radically. Hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) promoter and a striking correlation between expression of p63 and the clinical course of MCC have been reported. Most important, however, is the discovery that MCC development in the majority of cases is preceded by the integration of genomic sequences of the hitherto unknown Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Now a fundamental improvement in the understanding of MCC pathogenesis as well as the development of new therapeutic approaches based on this knowledge appear to be possible within the near future.",M2
19395876,"Merkel cell carcinoma: review.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is synonymous with primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma. It tends to affects elderly whites, but there is also an increased incidence among immunosuppressed patients. The recent identification of a novel polyomavirus associated with the tumor has stimulated renewed interest in its pathogenesis. MCC tends to show classic histologic features of a neuroendocrine carcinoma and is often positive for CK20, but nonclassic cytologic findings and unusual immunophenotypes may be observed and can lead to a diagnostic confusion. MCC needs to be distinguished from other primary cutaneous tumors with a small cell appearance and metastatic tumors. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, but radiation therapy has also found to be effective. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become an integral part of the staging of patients with MCC.",M2
19384948,"Merkel cell polyomavirus sequences are frequently detected in nonmelanoma skin cancer of immunosuppressed patients.Recently, a new human polyoma virus has been identified in Merkel cell carcinomas (<e>MCC</e>). MCC is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) associated with immunosuppression. Clonal integration of this virus which was termed Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCPyV) was reported in a number of MCC. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are also NMSC and are the most frequent cancers in the setting of immunosuppression. A unique group of 56 NMSC from 11 immunosuppressed patients and 147 NMSC of 125 immunocompetent patients was tested for MCPyV by DNA PCR, targeting the Large T Antigen and the structural Viral Protein 1. NMSC included SCC, BCC and Bowen's disease (BD). In addition, normal skin and 89 colorectal cancers were tested. MCPyV specific sequences were significantly more frequently found in NMSC of immunosuppressed patients compared to immunocompetent patients (p &lt; 0.001). In particular BD and BCC revealed a significant increased association of MCPyV of immunosuppressed patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.006). Forty-seven of 147 (32%) sporadic NMSC were MCPyV positive. Interestingly, 37.5% (36/96) of sporadic BCC of immunocompetent patients were MCPyV positive. No MCPyV was detected within normal skin and only 3 out of 89 of additionally tested colorectal cancers were MCPyV positive. Our data show that MCPyV is a frequently reactivated virus in immunocompromized patients. How MCPyV contributes to the pathogenesis of NMSC, i.e., BD, SCC and BCC, in immunosuppressed patients and in addition, potentially to the pathogenesis of a subset of sporadic BCC needs further investigations.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: A 79-year-old woman was seen with a neck lump and a lesion in the left nasal vestibule. Biopsy of the lesion revealed a primary neurendocrine MCC of the skin of the nasal vestibule with metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. The patient decided against any further active treatment. Follow-up of patient for 30 months showed spontaneous regression of the lesions without any active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although spontaneous resolution of MCC has been described for other head neck sites, there has not been any published case of nasal MCC regression. We present this rare case of nasal MCC with neck metastases and its regression.",M2
19365981,"Metastatic merkel cell carcinoma of the pancreas mimicking primary pancreatic endocrine tumor diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology: a case report.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a relatively infrequent, rapidly progressive and often fatal cutaneous malignancy exhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation. It has a penchant for local recurrence and distant metastasis to various sites, including regional lymph nodes, distant skin, lung, liver, testis and other rare organs, such as the pancreas. There are only 4 cases of MCC metastatic to the pancreas reported in the English-language literature, and they were all diagnosed by histology from pancreatic resection. CASE: A 79-year-old woman with a large pancreatic tail mass underwent endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). She had a history of MCC of the upper extremity with wide local excision 15 months earlier. Metastatic MCC was diagnosed based on the cytomorphology, characteristic immunohistochemical staining pattern, clinical history and comparison of the morphology with that of the primary tumor. CONCLUSION: The cytomorphology and immunohistochemical profile of this neoplasm mimicked a pancreatic endocrine tumor. We discuss the diagnostic pitfalls and differential diagnoses of the metastatic pancreatic MCC, highlighting the importance of thorough clinical history, attention to cytologic detail and corroborating immunohirtochemistry in arriving at the correct diagns. This is the first case ofa metastatic pancreatic MCC diagnosed by EUS-FNA cytology.",M2
19335694,"Merkel cell carcinoma of the inguinal lymph node with an unknown primary site.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an uncommon and aggressive primary neuroendocrine malignancy of the skin. Frequent local recurrences and disseminations to regional lymph nodes and distant organs are characteristic. MCC within the lymph nodes in the absence of a primary site is rare and has only been reported sporadically. We report a case of MCC presenting as a painless mass in the left inguinal area for 5 months in a 57-year-old man. The histopathology of the excised lesion revealed a poorly differentiated basophilic small cell tumor. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 and CD56, negative for cytokeratin 7, thyroid transcription factor-1 and CDX-2. These immunohistochemical findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a metastatic MCC. Despite extensive clinical and radiological investigation, we failed to identify the origin of the tumor. Our case may represent a lymph node metastasis from an occult or regressed skin primary, but we cannot preclude the possibility of a primary nodal tumor.",M2
19326371,"Frequent occurrence of RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation and Merkel cell polyomavirus in Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is one of the most aggressive cancers of the skin. It has recently been reported that integration of a Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in receptor tyrosine phosphates type G (PTPRG) gene occurs in MCC, and that viral infections are associated with epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) in cancer. To examine whether a correlation between TSG inactivation and viral infection can be found in MCC, we investigated the promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A, TP73, PTPRG, FHIT, and CDKN2A and the presence of MCPyV and SV40 in 98 MCC by PCR. Hypermethylation of RASSF1A was frequently found in 42 of 83 (51%) of MCC. Methylation of CDKN2A was present in 9 of 41 (22%) of MCC. Hypermethylation of TP73 (0%), PTPRG (4%), and FHIT (0%) was infrequent in MCC. Interestingly, MCPyV was found in 90 of 98 (92%) MCC, however, no SV40 signal was detected. No correlation between TSG hypermethylation and viral infection was found. Our results show frequent hypermethylation of RASSF1A and the presence of MCPyV in primary MCC, and that these events may contribute to the pathogenesis of MCC.",M2
19307957,"G3139 (Genasense) in patients with advanced merkel cell carcinoma.OBJECTIVES: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy of the skin. Preclinical studies have identified up-regulation of the critical antiapoptosis gene bcl-2 in MCC. We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of the novel bcl-2 antisense agent (G3139, Genasense) in patients with advanced MCC. METHODS: Twelve patients (9 men, 3 women) with histologically confirmed metastatic or regionally recurrent MCC were enrolled. Ten patients (83%) had received prior chemotherapy. Eight patients (67%) had Karnofsky performance status of 90 to 100. Patients received continuous IV infusion of G3139 (7 mg/kg/d) via central venous access in an outpatient setting for 14 days, followed by a 7-day rest period. Response was assessed at 6-week intervals. Patients were allowed to continue therapy until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. RESULTS: No objective responses were observed. The best response was stable disease in 3 patients and progressive disease in 9 patients. A median of 4 doses per patient (total 46 doses) was administered. Dose delays and/or reductions were required in 6 patients. One patient developed grade 4 lymphopenia. One patient developed grade 3 renal failure characterized by grade 3-elevated creatinine and grade 4 hyperkalemia. Other grade 3 events included cytopenia (n = 5), aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotranferease elevation (n = 3), hypophosphatemia (n = 2), and pain (n = 1). The most frequent grade 1 to 2 toxicities were elevated creatinine, ALT elevation, hypokalemia, lymphopenia, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 antisense therapy (G3139) was well tolerated among patients with advanced MCC. Although probable antitumor activity was documented in 1 patient, no objective responses per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were observed.",M2
19305499,"Ultrastructural proof of polyomavirus in Merkel cell carcinoma tumour cells and its absence in small cell carcinoma of the lung.BACKGROUND: A new virus called the Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) has recently been found in Merkel Cell Carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). MCC is a rare aggressive small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma primarily derived from the skin, morphologically indistinguishable from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). So far the actual presence of the virus in MCC tumour cells on a morphological level has not been demonstrated, and the presence of MCPyV in other small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas has not been studied yet. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated MCC tissue samples from five patients and SCLCs from ten patients for the presence of MCPyV-DNA by PCR and sequencing. Electron microscopy was used to search ultrastructurally for morphological presence of the virus in MCPyV-DNA positive samples. MCPyV was detected in two out of five primary MCCs. In one MCC patient MCPyV-DNA was detected in the primary tumour as well as in the metastasis, strongly suggesting integration of MCPyV in the cellular DNA of the tumour in this patient. In the primary MCC of another patient viral particles in tumour cell nuclei and cytoplasm were identified by electron microscopy, indicating active viral replication in the tumour cells. In none of the SCLCs MCPyV-DNA was detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strongly suggest that MCPyV is an oncogenic polyomavirus in humans, and is potentially causally related to the development of MCC but not to the morphological similar SCLC.",M2
19291712,"Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin: pathological and molecular evidence for a causative role of MCV in oncogenesis.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), a skin tumour with neuroendocrine features, was recently found to be associated with a new type of human polyomavirus, called Merkel cell virus (MCV). We investigated the specificity of this association as well as a causal role of MCV in oncogenesis. DNA and RNA from ten cases of MCC were analysed using PCR and RT-PCR. DNA from 1241 specimens of a wide range of human tumours was also analysed. The DIPS technique was used to identify the integration locus of viral DNA sequences. Array CGH was performed to analyse structural alterations of the cell genome. MCV DNA sequences were found in all ten cases of MCC and in none of the 1241 specimens of other tumour types. Clonal integration of MCV into the host genome was seen in all MCC cases and was checked by FISH in one case. A recurrent pattern of conserved viral sequences which encompassed the replication origin, the small tumour (ST), and the 5' part of the large tumour (LT) antigen DNA sequences was observed. Both ST and LT viral sequences were found to be significantly expressed in all MCCs. Neither recurrent site of integration nor alteration of cellular genes located near the viral sequences was observed. The tight association of MCV with MCC, the clonal pattern of MCV integration, and the expression of the viral oncoproteins strongly support a causative role for MCV in the tumour process. This information will help the development of novel approaches for the assessment and therapy of MCC and biologically related tumours.",M2
19276970,"Merkel cell carcinoma: lack of KIT positivity and implications for the use of imatinib mesylate.The large variability (7% to 100%) in previously reported rates of receptor tyrosine kinase KIT expression in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) may be owing to the use of heat-induced epitope retrieval. High frequency of reported KIT reactivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in part prompted the initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) for the treatment of advanced MCC. Our experience has been that a small number of MCCs (12.5%) are positive for KIT by IHC. We also found a higher rate of apparently KIT-positive MCCs (75%) using heat-induced epitope retrieval. Our anecdotal experience with the use of imatinib mesylate has been disappointing. As IHC detection of KIT expression does not correlate with the presence of KIT-activating mutations, protein expression as tested by IHC should not be used to determine if patients would respond to imatinib mesylate. Indeed, our review of the literature and the apparent lack of efficacy of imatinib mesylate for MCC in a recent phase 2 trial suggest a minor role for KIT signaling in MCC tumorigenesis.",M2
19206996,"Merkel cell carcinoma: case report and literature review, from a remote region of France.INTRODUCTION: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer. The first case was described by Toker in 1972 as a trabecular carcinoma of the skin. The most accepted origin of MCC is the Merkel cell (touch receptor). Merkel cell carcinoma occurs mostly in Caucasians aged over 65 years as a dome-shaped purple node on the head, neck or extremities. CASE REPORT: This report describes a case of MCC of 0.5 cm size, located on the left upper leg. The patient was Caucasian, female and aged 69 years with the specific risk factor of a history of sun exposure on the beach for 50 years. The excision biopsy returned a diagnosis of MCC. The excision of the biopsy scar, with clear margins of 3 cm and to a depth of 3 cm was performed 2 days later and returned a result of no MCC cells present. Biological tests were normal. No lesions were detected on CT scan of thorax and abdomen. No dissemination was detected on PET scan. It was ranked as stage I MCC. National Cancer Institute guidelines (2007) were used for follow up: physical examination every 3 months, PET scan every 6 months for 1 year; after this physical examination every 6 months and PET scan every year for 5 years. CONCLUSION: The role of the primary care physician operating in remote location is crucial for the early detection of skin cancers. Early detection is the only chance for a patient to survive an MCC. Every primary care physician operating in a remote location should master the surgical technique for excision biopsy, the gold standard for diagnosis of skin cancers.",M2

19131727,"Merkel cell carcinoma of the lower extremity: report of four cases and new considerations.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare neuroendocrine cutaneous malignancy that predominantly arises in the head and neck region. We describe clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment in 4 cases of MCC, presenting an uncommon female predominant occurrence and an unusual primary site: the lower limb. In all cases diagnosis was established by histopathologic examination. Primary MCC and locally recurrence disease were treated in all patients with a wide surgical excision (3-cm margin) including fascia. Lymphadenectomy was reserved for a patient with clinical evidence of nodal involvement. Both chemotherapy administered in 2 cases and radiotherapy in 1 case produced limited responses. Early diagnosis is critical because this tumor is aggressive and has a high rate of local recurrence and metastatic spread. However, its nondistinctive appearance frequently delays diagnosis and its rarity avoids an optimal treatment guideline setting.",M2
19125733,"Bif-1 and Bax expression in cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Bax-interacting factor-1 (Bif-1) binds to Bax, which in turn activates this proapoptotic protein. In the absence of Bif-1, the ability to induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway is greatly reduced. Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) classically shows an aggressive behavior and lack of response to chemotherapy, which remains unexplained. Previous studies have documented the presence of Bax in MCC, but Bif-1 expression has not been evaluated. Herein, the expression of Bif-1 and Bax in cutaneous MCC is examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of Bif-1 and Bax protein was examined in nine cases of MCC. Both positive and negative controls were conducted. All the cases were reviewed by a single dermatopathologist. RESULTS: Bif-1 was detected in nine cases (100%), and Bax was expressed in six cases (66%). The percent positive cells for Bif-1 in MCC ranged from 85% to 98% positive (mean 93.9%). At the same time, decreased Bax expression was shown with 0-8% positive cells (mean 3.45%). CONCLUSION: The increased expression of Bif-1 in MCC is associated with low levels of Bax staining. These findings suggest that the upregulation of Bif-1 could in part be responsible for tumorigenesis in cutaneous MCC. As shown, Bax and Bif-1 expression are not exclusively antithetical; therefore, future studies evaluating the expression of both proteins should be conducted.",M2
19112956,"Lymph node metastases of Merkel cell carcinoma from unknown primary site: report of three cases.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an uncommon aggressive neuroendocrine skin carcinoma. It usually affects sun-exposed skin of white elderly people. MCC is characterized by a high incidence of early locoregional relapse and distant metastases. Because of its rarity and the resulting lack of prospective randomized trials, data regarding the optimal treatment of MCC are limited. Despite aggressive multimodality treatment, the prognosis of patients bearing MCC is often poor. We report three cases of lymph node metastases of MCC with unknown primary sites. Two patients died 17 and 28 months after diagnosis due to brain and pancreatic metastases, respectively, without evidence of cutaneous disease. The third patient is alive and free of tumor at 16 months from the diagnosis. After an accurate diagnosis of lymph node metastases from MCC, the absence of a primary tumor at complete initial evaluation and during adequate follow-up can confirm this particular clinical scenario. The prognosis seems to be analogous to that of cases with similar disease stage (lymph node involvement) but a known primary site.",M2
19108971,"Diagnostic imaging in Merkel cell carcinoma: lessons to learn from 16 cases with correlation of sonography, CT, MRI and PET.OBJECTIVE: The authors report imaging findings in a series of 16 patients with <e>MCC</e>, a rare tumour which is often managed primarily by a dermatologist. To our knowledge, no equivalent series of MCC has been described in the nuclear medicine literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective noncomparative case series 16 patients with biopsy-proven Merkel cell carcinoma were included between January 1999 and October 2007. Twenty-nine whole body PET scans (18F-FDG n=24, 18F-FDOPA n=5) in 16 patients were retrospectively reviewed with regard to tracer uptake in six anatomical sites per patient. For 127/144 of FDG-PET evaluated regions and 68/144 of regions depicted by conventional imaging methods, a valid standard of reference could be obtained. A combined standard of reference was applied, which consisted of histopathology (lymphadenectomy or biopsy) or clinical or radiological follow-up for at least 12 months. Results: the mean FDG uptake over the clinicopatholigical verified FDG avid areas was 4.7 SUV (1.5-9.9 SUV). The region based assessment of diagnostic value, in consideration of the standard of reference, resulted in a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 96.2% of FDG-PET (n=127) and in a combined sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 89.1% for morphological imaging methods (n=68). Differences between methods did not reach statistical significance (p=1.00, p=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET is a highly useful whole body staging method of comparable value compared to conventional imaging methods with restricted field of view. The lessons learned from case series are discussed.",M2

Despite the fact that MCC is still a very rare tumor, its incidence is rapidly increasing; the American Cancer Society estimates for 2008 almost 1,500 new cases in the USA. These clinical observations are especially disturbing as the pathogenesis of MCC is not yet fully understood; however, a number of recent reports contribute to a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Here we describe findings regarding the role of Wnt, MAPK and Akt signaling as well as possible aberrations in the p14ARF/p53/RB tumor suppressor network in MCC. Most important, and possibly with high impact on future therapeutic approaches is the demonstration that a polyomavirus has frequently integrated in the genome of the MCC cells prior to tumor development.",M2
19020549,"Array-CGH reveals recurrent genomic changes in Merkel cell carcinoma including amplification of L-Myc.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer with poorly characterized genetics. We performed high resolution comparative genomic hybridization on 25 MCC specimens using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. Tumors frequently carried extra copies of chromosomes 1, 3q, 5p, and 6 and lost chromosomes 3p, 4, 5q, 7, 10, and 13. MCC tumors with less genomic aberration were associated with improved survival (P=0.04). Tumors from 13 of 22 MCC patients had detectable Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA, and these tumors had fewer genomic deletions. Three regions of genomic alteration were of particular interest: a deletion of 5q12-21 occurred in 26% of tumors, a deletion of 13q14-21 was recurrent in 26% of tumors and contains the well-characterized tumor suppressor RB1, and a previously unreported focal amplification at 1p34 was present in 39% of tumors and centers on L-Myc (MYCL1). L-Myc is related to the c-Myc proto-oncogene, has transforming activity, and is amplified in the closely related small cell lung cancer. Normal skin showed no L-Myc expression, whereas 4/4 MCC specimens tested expressed L-Myc RNA in relative proportion to the DNA copy number gain. These findings suggest several genes that may contribute to MCC pathogenesis, most notably L-Myc.",M2
19013049,"Long-term response of isolated limb perfusion with hyperthermia and chemotherapy for Merkel cell carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a very rare and aggressive neoplasm. Due to its rarity, therapeutic guidelines are not well established, especially for regionally advanced disease. Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP) with Melphalan and either with or without tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is becoming more common in clinical practice, yet the long-term response is not clear. Previous reports have established indications for treatment of unresectable MCC as well as the outcome of MCC patients receiving perfusion treatment in combination with other therapies (e.g., radiation). METHOD: A review was performed of the most important articles in MEDLINE from the last 20 years related to HILP and MCC. It was possible to collect all cases of HILP from the literature. Details of one case of MCC where HILP was administered was included in the literature review. RESULTS: A total of nine cases of MCC receiving ILP were identified in the literature; of these, seven achieved a complete response, one a partial response and one no response. All five patients treated without TNF-alpha had a complete response. Of the four patients treated with TNF-alpha, two had complete, one partial and one no response. CONCLUSION: Based on the cases described, isolated limb perfusion is an acceptable option to treat regional advanced cases of MCC, and the use of TNF-alpha does not impact the overall response.",M2
19006065,"Analysis of radiation therapy for the control of Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck based on 36 cases and a literature review.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare and aggressive epidermal cancer. We conducted a retrospective study and literature review to investigate the impact that radiation therapy has on local, regional, and distant control as part of the oncologic management of MCC of the head and neck and to further elucidate the role of radiation therapy with regard to regional control for the clinically uninvolved neck. We reviewed all registered cases of head and neck MCC that had occurred at four institutions from January 1988 through December 2005. Treatment and outcomes data were collected on patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I, II, and III tumors. Local, regional, and distant control rates were calculated by comparing variables with the Fisher exact test; Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to report actuarial control data. Stage I to III head and neck MCC was identified in 36 patients-22 men and 14 women, aged 43 to 97 years (mean: 71.6) at diagnosis. Patients with stage I and II tumors were combined into one group, and their data were compared with those of patients with stage III tumors. Twenty-six patients (72%) had clinical stage I/II disease and 10 patients (28%) had clinical stage III disease. Median follow-up was 41 months for the stage I/II group and 19 months for the stage III group. Based on examination at final follow-up visits, local recurrence was seen in 7 of the 36 patients (19%), for a local control rate of 81%. The 2-year actuarial local control rate for all stages of MCC was 83%; by treatment subgroup, the rates were 95% for those who had undergone radiation therapy to the primary site and 69% for those who had not-a statistically significant difference (p = 0.020). Based on information obtained at final follow-ups, 10 of the 36 patients (28%) experienced a regional recurrence, for a regional control rate of 72%. The 2-year actuarial regional control rate among all patients was 70%; by subgroup, rates were 82% for patients who had undergone regional node radiation therapy and 60% for those who had not-not a statistically significant difference (p = 0.225). Nine patients (25%) overall developed a distant metastasis, for a distant control rate of 75%. Salvage therapies included chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to the metastatic site, but neither had any significant effect on survival. Regardless of treatment, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves leveled off at 30 months with 82% survival for the stage I/II group and at 19 months with 60% survival for the stage III group. We conclude that radiation therapy to the primary tumor site (either following resection or definitively) results in a local control rate of more than 90% in patients with head and neck MCC. We also found a trend toward improved regional control of the clinically negative neck with the addition of radiation therapy.",M2
19001805,"Co-expression of KIT receptor and its ligand stem cell factor in Merkel cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND/AIMS: KIT receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, either by mutation or autocrine activation. Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare KIT-positive cutaneous tumor. We investigated the co-expression of KIT and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) in MCC. METHODS: Sixteen specimens from 13 MCC patients of various tumor stages were examined by immunohistochemistry for SCF, KIT, Ki67/MIB-1 and cleaved caspase 3 expression, and for apoptosis by TUNEL. RESULTS: KIT was expressed in 13 of 16 tumors, and SCF in 15 of 16 specimens. Co-expression of KIT and SCF was detected in 12 of 16 tumors. KIT and SCF immunoreactivity scores were independent of tumor stage. Ki67/MIB-1 proliferation rates were high, whereas apoptosis rates were low, and did not depend on KIT or SCF expression. CONCLUSION: Co-expression of KIT and SCF in a high percentage of MCC tumors hints to an autocrine mechanism. KIT and SCF expression in primary tumors and in metastases suggests an early event in Merkel cell transformation.",M2
18813128,"Frequent expression of glypican-3 in Merkel cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study of 55 cases.The pathologic diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is mainly based on routine morphology and a characteristic cytokeratin 20 (CK20) immunohistochemical staining pattern. However, about 10% to 15% of MCCs are reportedly CK20 negative and about 10% to 20% of MCCs have only focal CK20 positivity. We aimed to study glypican-3 (GPC3) expression in MCC and to compare it with CK20 expression in MCC. Immunohistochemical expression of GPC-3, CK20, and CD23 were studied in 55 cases of MCC and 21 cases of noncutaneous small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), including 10 cases of pulmonary SCNC and 11 cases of nonpulmonary SCNC. The results of GPC3 expression in these tumors were then compared with that of CK20. Of the 55 cases, 39 were positive for GPC3 (70.9%). Seventy-seven percent of the positive MCCs (30/39) showed GPC3 immunoreactivity in &gt; or = 30% tumor cells. Of the 55 cases, 53 were positive for CK20 (96%); 49 of them showed CK20 immunoreactivity in &gt; or = 30% tumor cells. All MCC cases were either positive for both GPC3 and CK20 (37 cases) or at least 1 of the markers (18 cases, 16 CK20 only and 2 GPC3 only). In addition, we studied GPC3 and CK20 expression in 10 cases of pulmonary SCNC and 11 cases of nonpulmonary SCNC. Three of ten pulmonary SCNC and 5 of 11 nonpulmonary SCNC expressed GPC3. All pulmonary SCNC and 9 of 11 nonpulmonary SCNC were negative for CK20. All cases of MCC and SCNC were negative for CD23. In conclusion, GPC3 is frequently expressed in SCNC of various origins, in particular in MCC, which, in combination with CK20, may represent another useful marker in the diagnosis of MCC.",M2
18812503,"T antigen mutations are a human tumor-specific signature for Merkel cell polyomavirus.Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a virus discovered in our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh that is monoclonally integrated into the genome of approximately 80% of human Merkel cell carcinomas (<e>MCCs</e>). Transcript mapping was performed to show that MCV expresses transcripts in MCCs similar to large T (LT), small T (ST), and 17kT transcripts of SV40. Nine MCC tumor-derived LT genomic sequences have been examined, and all were found to harbor mutations prematurely truncating the MCV LT helicase. In contrast, four presumed episomal viruses from nontumor sources did not possess this T antigen signature mutation. Using coimmunoprecipitation and origin replication assays, we show that tumor-derived virus mutations do not affect retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) binding by LT but do eliminate viral DNA replication capacity. Identification of an MCC cell line (MKL-1) having monoclonal MCV integration and the signature LT mutation allowed us to functionally test both tumor-derived and wild type (WT) T antigens. Only WT LT expression activates replication of integrated MCV DNA in MKL-1 cells. Our findings suggest that MCV-positive MCC tumor cells undergo selection for LT mutations to prevent autoactivation of integrated virus replication that would be detrimental to cell survival. Because these mutations render the virus replication-incompetent, MCV is not a  passenger virus  that secondarily infects MCC tumors.",M2

Histological examination showed a trichilemmal cyst with 3 nests of small blue round cells within the basal layer of the cyst lining. There were many mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies. The stain for cytokeratin 20  decorated  the tumor cells with an unequivocal perinuclear dot-like pattern, confirming their Merkel cell origin. Dermal Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) arising in association with benign adnexal tumors or cysts, with or without epithelial involvement, is a rare event. MCC in situ in this context has not been previously reported. The immunostain for cytokeratin 20 is an important ancillary study in diagnosing MCC. Our case supports the view that a subset of MCCs is of intraepithelial origin and underscores the clinical importance of surveillance for changes in an  innocent  cyst.",M2
18798233,"Merkel cell carcinoma: histologic features and prognosis.BACKGROUND: Currently, little is known regarding the potential prognostic value of histologic features in primary cutaneous neuroendocrine (Merkel cell) carcinomas (<e>MCC</e>). METHODS: In a retrospective review of the tumor histology and clinical outcome data (median follow-up, 51 months; range, 3-224 months) of 156 patients with a diagnosis of MCC, the following histologic features were evaluated: tumor thickness, tumor size (greatest dimension of the tumor), microanatomic compartment involved by tumor (dermis and/or subcutis and/or deeper), tumor growth pattern (nodular circumscribed vs infiltrative), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor necrosis, ulceration, and solar elastosis. RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate was 67.5%. On univariate analysis, parameters that were associated significantly with survival were tumor thickness (P= .001), tumor size (P= .0002), deepest anatomic compartment involved by tumor (P= .0003), tumor growth pattern (P= .003), LVI (P&lt; .00001), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P= .05), and solar elastosis (P= .04). On multivariate analysis, the presence of a nodular growth pattern, low tumor depth, and absence of LVI were associated with longer survival. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the known prognostic value of tumor stage, 3 histologic features were identified to have prognostic significance: tumor thickness (depth of tumor invasion), the presence of LVI, and tumor growth pattern.",M2
18767173,"Management of the neck in Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck: University of Miami experience.BACKGROUND: We reviewed management of the cervical lymph nodes in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) of the head and neck. METHODS: Records of 15 patients with MCC of the head and neck area were evaluated for the type of surgical treatment, including wide local excision, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, neck dissection, postoperative radiation therapy, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 5-84 months). Ten patients were treated with wide local excision plus SLN, with or without neck dissection. Five patients were treated with wide local excision only or wide local excision plus neck dissection. One patient died of distant metastases (7%), and 14 patients remain alive (93%), over a mean follow-up of 24 months. CONCLUSION: Wide excision and SLN biopsy for primary MCC with N0 neck is feasible for early-stage, previously untreated lesions. SLN biopsy was helpful in determining the nodal levels to be dissected or irradiated.",M2

18707820,"Weekly carboplatin reduces toxicity during synchronous chemoradiotherapy for Merkel cell carcinoma of skin.PURPOSE: The toxicity of radiotherapy (RT) combined with weekly carboplatin and adjuvant carboplatin and etoposide was prospectively assessed in a group of patients with high-risk Stage I and II Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin. This regimen was compared with the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 96:07 study, which used identical eligibility criteria but carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks during RT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible if they had disease localized to the primary site and lymph nodes, with high-risk features. RT was delivered to the primary site and lymph nodes to a dose of 50 Gy and weekly carboplatin (area under the curve of 2) was given during RT. This was followed by three cycles of carboplatin and etoposide. A total of 18 patients were entered into the study, and their data were compared with the data from 53 patients entered into the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 96:07 study. RESULTS: Involved lymph nodes (Stage II) were present in 14 patients (77%). Treatment was completed as planned in 16 patients. The weekly carboplatin dose was delivered in 17 patients, and 15 were able to complete all three cycles of adjuvant carboplatin and etoposide. Grade 3 and 4 neutrophil toxicity occurred in 7 patients, but no cases of febrile neutropenia developed. Compared with the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 96:07 protocol (19 of 53 cases of febrile neutropenia), the reduction in the febrile neutropenia rate (p = 0.003) and decrease in Grade 3 skin toxicity (p = 0.006) were highly statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that weekly carboplatin at this dosage is a safe way to deliver synchronous chemotherapy during RT for <e>MCC</e> and results in a marked reduction of febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 skin toxicity compared with the three weekly regimen.",M2

Some centres have reported results from larger series of patients, but these do not include Asian or Japanese centres. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review our experience with the surgical treatment of <e>MCC</e> of the face in the Japanese and to study its management and outcome using the staging system described by Clark et al. METHODS: We report our experiences with 16 cases between 1991 and 2004. Patients and tumour characteristics, treatment variables and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: The follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 180 months. The average was 32.6 months and the median was 17.5 months. The relapse-free survival for all patients was 51% at 2 years. The relapse-free survival was 80% for the patients with Stage I and 33% with Stage II at 2 years. CONCLUSION: This staging system was suggested to reflect prognosis although the number of patients in this series was small. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered to determine the accurate nodal staging, and patients with MCC of the head and neck may be treated according to the revised staging system by Clark et al.",M2

18645305,"Acetylcholine receptor expression in Merkel cell carcinoma.Neurocrest-derived tissues express muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR and nAChR respectively). These receptors are critical for migration of neurocrest-derived cells to their corresponding tissues during development. Recent reports demonstrate neurocrest-derived melanoma and numerous non-Merkel cell neuroendocrine tumors express both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. In light of the controversy surrounding the origin and pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>), we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of both mAChR and nAChR in MCC. Fifteen cases of primary non-metastatic cutaneous MCC archived at a large veterans' hospital and tertiary referral dermatopathology service were retrieved by computer-assisted search. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to evaluate the presence of M3, M5 and beta 2 nAChR expression. All the cases were confirmed prior to study by a single board certified dermatopathologist (MBM). Fifteen cases of primary cutaneous MCC were diffusely positive for M3 and M5 mAChR staining. All cases lacked immunohistochemical staining for the beta 2 nAChR. Despite the limited number of cases, MCC appears to uniformly express M3 and M5 receptors. These receptors have been linked to cell proliferation and migration which may confer a potential therapeutic target.",M2
18616759,"Comparison of CD23 staining patterns in Merkel cell carcinoma and non-cutaneous small cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: During our daily practice, we observed that cluster designation 23 (CD23) (clone BU38) labels Merkel cells in normal skin. In this study, we examined the expression of CD23 in Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) and assessed its usefulness in distinguishing MCC from non-cutaneous small cell carcinoma (SMCC). METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of CD23 was performed on a total of 33 MCCs, 22 SMCCs and 5 carcinoid tumors. RESULTS: CD23 reactivity was present in 32 of 33 (97%) MCCs, 18 of 22 (82%) SMCCs and 5 of 5 (100%) carcinoid tumors. In MCC, 19 cases (59%) showed a predominance of perinuclear dot-like staining similar to cytokeratin 20, 3 (9%) showed mostly cytoplasmic staining and 10 (31%) displayed a combination of perinuclear dot-like and cytoplasmic staining. In contrast, all CD23-positive SMCCs and carcinoid tumors showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. There was a significant difference in the CD23 staining patterns between MCC and SMCC (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: CD23 is expressed in the majority of MCC, SMCC and carcinoid tumor irrespective of clinical outcome. The distinct punctate CD23 staining for MCC may be helpful in differentiating it from SMCC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the expression of CD23 in neuroendocrine tumors.",M2
18594470,"Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in primary and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in the development and progression of many tumors, and its inhibition has been shown to block tumor growth. This study examined COX-2 expression in primary and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 26 primary MCCs and 7 lymph node metastases were stained immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody directed against COX-2, and the percentage and intensity of staining were analyzed semiquantitatively. Immunopositivity for COX-2 was found in 20 primary tumors (77%), and was diffuse in 16 of them (80%). Staining intensity was strong in 5 tumors (19%), moderate in 6 (23%), and weak in 9 (35%). Five metastases (71%) showed similar staining. Prominent mitotic activity was associated with more diffuse COX-2 immunopositivity. No association was found between COX-2 expression and outcome. This study confirms that most MCCs express COX-2 and shows that COX-2 expression is related to one parameter of aggressive behavior--a high mitotic rate--but not to any others. The possibility of treating MCC with COX-2 inhibitors should be considered.",M2
18593898,"Frequent detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus in human Merkel cell carcinomas and identification of a unique deletion in the VP1 gene.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare but very aggressive human malignancy of the elderly or immunosuppressed patients. Recently, the clonal integration of a new human polyoma virus, which was termed Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), has been reported in 8 of 10 MCC patients. In the present study, we studied the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of 39 MCC for the presence of MCPyV by PCR. We applied four different primer sets directed against the large T antigen and the VP1 gene of MCPyV. We were able to detect MCPyV in 77% (n = 30) of MCC as confirmed by sequence analyses of the PCR products. Sequence analyses showed only minor nucleotide changes compared with the previously published MCC sequences. In addition, one patient revealed the amplification of two PCR products using PCR primers directed against the VP1 gene. Sequence analyses confirmed the presence of the expected 351-bp PCR product and in addition a second PCR product of 261 bp containing a unique 90-bp deletion in the VP1 gene, which will lead to a predicted loss of 28 amino acids. The unique 90-bp deletion within the VP1 gene possibly is a result of incomplete viral integration of MCPyV in the MCC. The presence of MCPyV in the majority of MCC tissue specimens in our study strongly underlines a possible role for MCPyV as an etiologic agent in the carcinogenesis of MCC.",M2

Additionally, IFN-alpha potently decreased DNA-synthesis and Ki67/MIB-1 proliferation index of MCC-1 cultures. Furthermore, IFN-alpha induced dose-dependently apoptosis of MCC-1 cells as shown by caspase-3 activation, and detection of apoptotic DNA strand breaks and fragmented nuclei. These findings suggest that IFN-alpha may have antitumor activity against Merkel cell carcinoma.",M2
18543036,"Management of merkel cell carcinoma: the roles of lymphoscintigraphy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant radiotherapy.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an uncommon, highly aggressive skin malignancy with a propensity to recur locally and regionally. However, its optimal treatment is uncertain. In this study, we aimed to assess the roles of lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node (SN) biopsy, as well as radiotherapy, in the treatment of MCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 17 patients diagnosed with MCC (median age 74 years) over a 7-year period (median follow-up 16 months) was performed. RESULTS: Of 11 patients. 3 had a positive SN biopsy and, despite adjuvant radiotherapy, 2 of these 3 developed regional lymph node (RLN) recurrence. Of the remaining 8 patients who had a negative SN biopsy, however, 5 also had RLN recurrences. There were 9 patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) to the primary site, with no in-field recurrences; and 8 who received RT to their RLN field, with only 2 developing regional nodal recurrences-both were SN biopsy positive. During the follow-up period, 2 patients died, only 1 due to MCC. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that SN status may not be an accurate predictor of loco-regional recurrence in MCC. However, they strongly reinforce previous reports that radiotherapy, both locally and to regional nodes, provides effective infield disease control.",M2
18511325,"[Merkel cell carcinoma: outcome and role of radiotherapy]Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) are rare neuroendocrine malignant tumor of the skin, occurring in elderly patients. It affects primarily the sun-exposed areas of the skin, with approximately 50% of all tumors occurring in the face and neck and 40% in the extremities. Immunohistochemical markers (CK20+, CK7- and TTF1-) are used to distinguish between MCC and other tumors. MCC have a tendency to rapid local progression, frequent spread to regional lymph nodes and distant metastases. Due to the rarity of the disease, the optimal treatment has not been fully defined. Localized stages (stages I and II) are treated by surgical excision of the primary tumor (with 2 to 3 cm margin) and lymphadenectomy in case of node-positive disease, followed by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a total dose of 50 to 60Gy in the tumor bed. Adjuvant EBRT has been shown to decrease markedly locoregional recurrences and to increase survival in recent studies. Treatment of lymph nodes area is more controversial. Chemotherapy is recommended only for metastatic disease.",M2
18497730,"Right leg swelling as primary presentation of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare malignant cutaneous neuroendocrine tumour with an aggressive behaviour and frequent regional lymph node and distant metastases. It mostly occurs in old patients and the commonest sites are the skin of the head, neck and the extremities. Typically, the primary tumour presents as a fast-growing, painless, reddish nodule with an iceberg-like effect, broadening in the depth. Although the pathogenesis of MCC remains largely unknown, ultraviolet radiation and immunosuppression are likely to play a significant pathogenetic role. The authors describe an unusual case of MCC clinically presenting as lymphedema on the right leg due to an inguinal lymphonodal metastasis. Although extensive investigations were performed the authors were unable to discover the cutaneous primary tumor. The authors examine the etiopathogenesis and hypothesis of this rare tumour and describe the clinical differential diagnosis.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a DNA polymerase present in thymic T cells, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, and some cases of acute myeloid leukemia. After observing TdT immunoreactivity in a case of MCC, we analyzed 26 tumors by immunohistochemical analysis to determine their spectrum of reactivity with TdT and identified TdT in 19 (73%) of 26 MCCs. Staining intensity was variable but was often moderate to strong and present in a significant percentage of cells. Because MCC has cytomorphologic features similar to those of lymphoblastic lymphoma and may manifest as metastatic disease, reactivity with TdT in MCC could represent a diagnostic pitfall in the differential diagnosis with lymphoblastic lymphoma, particularly because the latter may lack CD45 and/or CD20, yet both neoplasms may express PAX-5, a B-cell-associated marker.",M2

It has a high propensity for recurrence post-treatment; 5-year overall survival rates range from 23% to 80%. (2) The rarity of MCC means that there is a lack of prospective controlled trials in these patients. Patients are generally treated with surgery as a first-line therapy, supplemented with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy if required. (3) The use of adjuvant therapies in MCC remains controversial. Data from case series and meta-analyses of case series suggest that the addition of radiotherapy to surgery in patients with MCC can confer significant benefits with regard to reducing local and regional recurrence rates and prolonging disease-free survival. Generally, the current literature tends not to support the use of chemotherapy in these patients. (4) Stage-specific treatment regimens have been outlined involving various combinations of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy for International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage I to III disease, while the emphasis of treatment in patients with UICC stage IV disease is on palliative care with or without radio- or chemotherapy.

18386054,"Trisomy of chromosome 6 in Merkel cell carcinoma within lymph nodes.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) of the skin is a neuroendocrine tumor with characteristic histological and immunohistochemical features. Among various cytogenetic changes, trisomy of chromosome 6 has been reported in 47% of cases using in situ hybridization. Primary tumors, morphologically and immunohistochemically identical to MCCs of the skin, have been described in other organs, including lymph nodes. Here, a cytogenetic study of four cases of MCC of lymph nodes is presented. Four cases of primary MCCs of lymph nodes and ten cases of cutaneous MCCs were studied for chromosome 6 using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). All cases showed typical features of MCC both at hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry. FISH showed trisomy 6 in two out of the four cases ofMCCs of lymph node as well as in 6 out 10 cases of MCCs of skin. Lymph nodal and cutaneous MCCs share same histological and immunohistochemical features, as well as same cytogenetic alteration for chromosome 6. It seems that there are more similarities than differences between cutaneous and lymph nodal MCCs. Whether lymph nodal MCCs are primary tumors or metastases from regressed skin lesions is still questionable, although several findings indicate a primary origin.",M2

The purpose of this study was to fully characterize the light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of vascular changes associated with MCC and to determine their frequency and differential diagnostic implications. Additionally, the presence of human herpesvirus 8 DNA in the lesional tissue was investigated. Of 92 studied cases of MCC, 18 cases (20%) were found to exhibit foci of prominent vascular changes which were classified into the following 6 patterns: pericyte hyperplasia, pyogenic granuloma-like, hemangioendothelioma-like, epithelioid hemangioma-like, peliosis-like, and follicular dendritic cell tumor-like pattern. In addition, Azzopardi phenomenon was observed. These changes occurred singly or in combination. Human herpesvirus 8 DNA was identified by polymerase chain reaction in none of the 18 cases. It is concluded that prominent vascular proliferations may be seen in 20% of MCC, and thereby, MCC resembles neuroendocrine tumors in other organs. When unduly prominent and encountered in a limited biopsy specimen, vascular alterations may represent a potential diagnostic pitfall, but, on the other hand, they themselves may serve as a clue to the correct diagnosis. Human herpesvirus 8 does not play a role in angiogenesis in MCC.",M2

Although multiple MCC have been described, they are rare, and metastases must be excluded. We report a case of a 59-year-old white male who presented with abrupt onset of multiple small bluish papules on his frontal scalp. On low power, the tumor had the overall histological silhouette of a nodular basal cell carcinoma. However, because of the lack of an epithelial connection and the cell's cytomorphological features, a MCC was considered and was subsequently confirmed using immunohistochemical stains.

It is commonly seen in elderly affecting the head, neck, and extremities. Macroscopically may be difficult to distinguish <e>MCC</e> from other small cells neoplasms especially oat cell carcinoma of the lung. CASE PRESENTATION: It is presented a case report concerning a 72 years old male with a MMC on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist. The patient underwent a diagnostic excisional biopsy and after the histological confirmation of the diagnosis a second excision was performed to achieve free margins. No postoperative radiation or adjuvant chemotherapy was given and within 9 years follow up no recurrence was reported. CONCLUSION: Although most cases present as localized disease treatment should be definitive due to high rates of local or systemic recurrence. Treatment includes excision of the lesion, lymphadenectomy, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on the stage of the disease. Even when locoregional control is achieved close surveillance is required due to high rates of relapse.",M2
18280333,"Clinical characteristics of Merkel cell carcinoma at diagnosis in 195 patients: the AEIOU features.BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an aggressive skin cancer with a mortality of 33%. Advanced disease at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, suggesting that earlier detection may improve outcome. No systematic analysis has been published to define the clinical features that are characteristic of MCC. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the clinical characteristics present at diagnosis to identify features that may aid clinicians in recognizing MCC. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 195 patients given the diagnosis of MCC between 1980 and 2007. Data were collected prospectively in the majority of cases, and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS: An important finding was that 88% of MCCs were asymptomatic (nontender) despite rapid growth in the prior 3 months (63% of lesions) and being red or pink (56%). A majority of MCC lesions (56%) were presumed at biopsy to be benign, with a cyst/acneiform lesion being the single most common diagnosis (32%) given. The median delay from lesion appearance to biopsy was 3 months (range 1-54 months), and median tumor diameter was 1.8 cm. Similar to earlier studies, 81% of primary MCCs occurred on ultraviolet-exposed sites, and our cohort was elderly (90% &gt;50 years), predominantly white (98%), and often profoundly immune suppressed (7.8%). An additional novel finding was that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was more than 30-fold overrepresented among patients with MCC. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited to patients seen at a tertiary care center. Complete clinical data could not be obtained on all patients. This study could not assess the specificity of the clinical characteristics of MCC. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to define clinical features that may serve as clues in the diagnosis of MCC. The most significant features can be summarized in an acronym: AEIOU (asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, expanding rapidly, immune suppression, older than 50 years, and ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin). In our series, 89% of primary MCCs had 3 or more of these findings. Although MCC is uncommon, when present in combination, these features may indicate a concerning process that would warrant biopsy. In particular, a lesion that is red and expanding rapidly yet asymptomatic should be of concern.",M2
18252145,"[Merkel cell carcinoma and sentinel lymph node dissection: nine cases report]Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is an aggressive cutaneous-neuroendocrine neoplasia with poor prognosis and high propensity for locoregional and distant metastasis. Lack of knowledge about its biological behavior, pathogenesis, and prognostic factors, complicates the prospective evaluation. Sentinel node dissection, concomitant with radical excision of the lesion, has increased in the last few years. The suitability of this technique is linked to the MCC high tendency to spread  in primis  at locoregional nodes such as other malignancies such as cutaneous melanoma. Aim of the study is the prospective evaluation of the sentinel node dissection and of the adjuvant therapies in 9 patients MCC affected. All patients, underwent evaluation and staging of the neoplasia. Diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy and histological examination. Sentinel node dissection was performed in patients without clinical locoregional metastases (8 cases). Patients with sentinel node positive for metastasis underwent radical lymphadenectomy (3 cases). One patient affected by clinically locoregional metastases had, at once, radical lymphadenectomy. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy were implemented (4 cases).",M2

In this study, we obtained MCCs from 21 elderly patients (19 women, 2 men) and analyzed their DNA for mutation of exons of interest in several tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes known to be frequently mutated in skin cancer: p53 (exons 4-8), Ras (exons 1 and 2), c-Kit (exon 11), and the INK4a-ARF locus (encoding p14 and p16) (exons 1 and 2). Direct sequence analysis revealed p53 mutations (that is, at codons 224, 234, and 294) in three tumors (14%) and p16INK4a mutations (that is, at codon 6) in one (5%). No mutations were detected in Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras, c-Kit, or p14ARF. On the other hand, methylation-specific PCR revealed methylation of p14ARF promoter DNA in eight of 19 analyzable tumor samples (42%) and p16INK4a promoter DNA in one of 19 analyzable tumor samples (5%). Together, these findings suggest that p14ARF silencing may be an important mechanism in MCC tumorigenesis, and thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this highly aggressive tumor type.",M2
18205628,"The potential contribution of fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis to the cytopathological diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma.We report the cases of two patients with head and neck Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) who developed local recurrences confirmed by cytopathology. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed for research purposes using centromeric probes of chromosomes 6 and 8, on cytological slides. Trisomy of chromosome 6 was found in 85% of tumour cells in the first case of MCC and case 2 exhibited trisomy 8 in 77% of tumour cells. In the absence of specific molecular markers, detection of trisomy 6 and/or trisomy 8 could help in identifying MCC. FISH analysis is easily and quickly performed on interphase nuclei obtained through fine needle aspiration and may be extended to the study of other relevant genetic abnormalities.",M2
18202256,"Clonal integration of a polyomavirus in human Merkel cell carcinoma.Merkel cell carcinoma (<e>MCC</e>) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. We studied MCC samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. Further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387-base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV). MCV sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) MCC tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. In six of eight MCV-positive MCCs, viral DNA was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that MCV infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Thus, MCV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of MCC.",M2
