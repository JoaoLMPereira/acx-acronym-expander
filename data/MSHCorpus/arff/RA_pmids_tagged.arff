20022110,"Differences in the distribution of subtypes according to the WHO classification 2008 between Japanese and German patients with refractory anemia according to the FAB classification in myelodysplastic syndromes.We reported the different clinical features between Japanese and German refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) patients in FAB classification. We re-analyzed the clinical features by WHO classification revised in 2008. The frequencies of refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD) and myelodysplastic syndrome-unclassified (MDS-U) with pancytopenia in Japanese patients were higher than in German patients (p&lt;0.001). Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia patients showed the most unfavorable prognosis in both countries. The higher frequencies of MDS-U with pancytopenia and RCUD in Japanese patients may influence the different clinical characteristics between Japanese and German FAB-RA patients.",M1
19563026,"[Re-evaluation of classification of myelodysplastic syndromes with low percentage bone marrow blasts]OBJECTIVE: To apply the WHO criteria and the minimal diagnostic criteria to the classification of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with low percentage (&lt; 0.050) bone marrow (BM) blasts. METHODS: Two hundred and ten MDS patients with less than 0.050 BM blasts diagnosed between 1988 and 2005 according to FAB criteria were retrospectively reclassified with WHO criteria (2001) and minimal diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: According to the WHO criteria, 5 patients were diagnosed as refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 7 as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 76 as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), 9 as RCMD-RS, 35 as MDS-unclassified (MDS-U), 3 as 5q - syndromes, and the rest 75 patients could not be classified suitably. Among the latter 75 patients 16 BM smears showed dysplasia in more than 2 cell lineage but only unilineage cytopenia in peripheral blood (PB). Nine of them were reclassified as RCMD after followed up for more than half a year. Forty-four BM smears showed erythroid dysplasia only, but bicytopenia or pancytopenia in PB. Twenty-seven of them were classified as RCMD after follow-up. Fifteen BM smears not showed dysplasia in any myeloid lineage were reclassified as MDS (5 patients), HS-MDS (5 patients) and idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance (ICUS) (5 patients) according to the MDS minimal diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSION: According to WHO criteria (2001), RA is the least diagnosis in MDS. The minimal diagnostic criteria for MDS classification of patients not fulfilled the standard criteria of MDS.",M1
19499580,"Treatment of children with refractory anemia: the Japanese Childhood MDS Study Group trial (MDS99).BACKGROUND: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is offered as a curative therapy for pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), it may cause severe complications and mortality. Several reports have shown the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in adult patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), but its safety and efficacy remains to be fully elucidated in childhood RA. PROCEDURE: Eleven children diagnosed with RA and enrolled on a prospective multicenter trial conducted by the Japanese Childhood MDS Study Group were eligible for analysis. If patients showed transfusion dependent or suffered from infection due to neutropenia, they received IST consisting of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine (CyA), and methylprednisolone (mPSL). RESULTS: Eight children received IST, 2 received only supportive therapy, and one underwent HSCT without IST. Five (63%) of eight children who received IST showed hematological response. Of note, one patient showed the disappearance of monosomy 7 after IST. Responders were significantly younger than non-responders (29 months vs. 140 months; P = 0.03). No severe adverse events related to IST were reported in this study. Of 6 children with chromosomal abnormalities who received IST, four showed hematological response. The probability of failure-free and overall survival at 5 years was 63 +/- 17% and 90 +/- 9% respectively. CONCLUSION: IST is likely to be a safe and effective modality for childhood RA.",M1
19411106,"The significance of bone marrow cell morphology and its correlation with cytogenetic features in the diagnosis of MDS-<e>RA</e> patients.Besides cytopenia, dysplasia is crucial characteristic of MDS-RA. To summarize the morphological features that contribute to the diagnosis of MDS-RA, 48 RA patients with abnormal karyotype were analyzed for the features of morphological and cytogenetical abnormalities and the relationships between them. 46 MDS-RA patients with normal karyotype and 207 patients with non-MDS anemia were enrolled into control groups. More conspicuous and diverse dysplasia can be found in abnormal karyotype MDS-RA than those in control groups (P&lt;0.05). Apparent dysplasia in granulocyte and megakaryocytoid lineages may provide valuable evidence for the diagnosis. Dysplasia occurred more frequently in patients with severe chromosome abnormalities.",M1
19148135,"Erythroid precursors from patients with low-risk myelodysplasia demonstrate ultrastructural features of enhanced autophagy of mitochondria.Recent studies in erythroid cells have shown that autophagy is an important process for the physiological clearance of mitochondria during terminal differentiation. However, autophagy also plays an important role in removing damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Defective mitochondria and impaired erythroid maturation are important characteristics of low-risk myelodysplasia. In this study we therefore questioned whether the autophagic clearance of mitochondria might be altered in erythroblasts from patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>, n=3) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, n=6). Ultrastructurally, abnormal and iron-laden mitochondria were abundant, especially in RARS patients. A large proportion (52+/-16%) of immature and mature myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) erythroblasts contained cytoplasmic vacuoles, partly double membraned and positive for lysosomal marker LAMP-2 and mitochondrial markers, findings compatible with autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. In healthy controls only mature erythroblasts comprised these vacuoles (12+/-3%). These findings were confirmed morphometrically showing an increased vacuolar surface in MDS erythroblasts compared to controls (P&lt;0.0001). In summary, these data indicate that MDS erythroblasts show features of enhanced autophagy at an earlier stage of erythroid differentiation than in normal controls. The enhanced autophagy might be a cell protective mechanism to remove defective iron-laden mitochondria.",M1
19136196,"Defective cytotoxicity of T lymphocytes in myelodysplastic syndrome.OBJECTIVE: The capacity of mononuclear blood cells to form autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes was investigated in order to elucidate the mechanism of successful immunosuppressive therapy in some myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (autoreactivity studies). The failure in autoreactivity studies raised the question of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte formation in MDS (alloreactivity studies). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen MDS patients and relevant controls were examined. Autoreactive lymphocytes directed against autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and alloreactive lymphocytes directed against unrelated third-party cells were tested using cytotoxicity assay. In addition, we used one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction, human androgen receptor test for clonality detection, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma testing. RESULTS: We did not confirm the presence of autoreactive T cells in eight of nine MDS patients tested. The response to allogeneic cells was impaired in 11 of 16 MDS patients, more often in refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>; 80%) than in RA with ring sideroblasts (40%). Interestingly, the response to allogeneic cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction was normal in all MDS patients. T lymphocytes were polyclonal in all but one patient. Tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma level in supernatants of mononuclear cells was significantly reduced in RA. CONCLUSION: The presumed autoaggressive T cells were not confirmed in MDS in our experimental arrangement. Alloreactivity studies demonstrated the impairment of effector cytotoxic phase of cell-mediated immunological reaction in MDS, namely in RA. The significance of our finding of defective cytotoxicity for pathogenesis, clinical course, and even for therapy is discussed together with other immunological defects reported so far.",M1
19080358,"Prognostic analysis of refractory anaemia in adult myelodysplastic syndromes.BACKGROUND: Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) display a very diverse pattern. In this study, we investigated prognostic factors and survival rate in adult patients with MDS refractory anaemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>) diagnosed according to French-American-British classification and evaluated the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for Chinese patients. METHODS: A multi-center study on diagnosis of MDS-RA was conducted to characterize the clinical features of Chinese MDS patients. The morphological criteria for the diagnosis of MDS-RA were first standardized. Clinical data of 307 MDS-RA patients collected from Shanghai, Suzhou and Beijing from 1995 to 2006 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve, log rank and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The median age of 307 MDS-RA cases was 52 years. The frequency of 2 or 3 lineage cytopenias was 85.6%. Abnormal karyotype occurred in 35.7% of 235 patients. There were 165 cases (70.2%) in the good IPSS cytogenetic subgroup, 44 cases (18.7%) intermediate and 26 cases (11.1%) poor. IPSS showed 20 (8.5%) categorized as low risk, 195 cases (83.0%) as intermediate-I risk and 20 cases (8.5%) as intermediate-II risk. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year survival rates were 90.8%, 85.7%, 82.9%, 74.9% and 71.2% respectively. Fifteen cases (4.9%) transformed to acute myeloid leukaemia (median time 15.9 months, range 3 - 102 months). Lower white blood cell count (&lt; 1.5 x 10(9)/L), platelet count (&lt; 30 x 10(9)/L) and cytogenetic abnormalities were independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis, but age (= 65 years), IPSS cytogenetic subgroup and IPSS risk subgroup were not independent prognostic factors associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients were younger, and had lower incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities, more severe cytopenias but a more favourable prognosis than Western patients. The major prognostic factors were lower white blood cell count, lower platelet count and fewer abnormal karyotypes. The international prognostic scoring system risk group was not an independent prognostic factor for Chinese myelodysplastic syndrome patients with refractory anaemia patients.",M1
18691343,"Clinical significance of Th1/Th2 ratio in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.In this study, we attempted to evaluate the clinical significance of T helper 1 (Th1)/T helper 2 (Th2) ratio in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), five refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>), four refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 31 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), nine refractory anaemia with excess blast-1 (RAEB-1) and seven refractory anaemia with excess blast-2 (RAEB-2). Intracellular interleukin-4 (Th2 cytokine) and interferon-gamma (Th1 cytokine) production was assessed in CD4+ T lymphocytes activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin using flow cytometry. Mean Th1/Th2 ratios in each MDS group were as follows: RA/RARS, 8.8 (95% CI, 5.8-11.8), RCMD, 14.7 (95% CI, 9.5-19.9), RAEB-1, 10.6 (95% CI, 4.6-16.6), RAEB-2, 12.8 (95% CI, 3.0-22.7) and control 12.8 (95% CI, 9.6-16.1). There were no significant differences in Th1/Th2 ratio in the RA/RARS, RCMD, RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subgroups when compared to controls. Because Th1/Th2 ratio in the RCMD group was widely distributed, we divided RCMD patients according to Th1/Th2 ratio into three groups (low, normal and high Th1/Th2 groups). There were no differences in severity of cytopenia among the three above groups. However, the percentage of CD8 cells in the low Th1/Th2 group was significantly lower than those in the high group (P &lt; 0.01). These data suggest that Th1/Th2 imbalance induces CD4/CD8 imbalance, and serves as a marker of the biological interplay in immune regulation.",M1
18477214,"Characterization of myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia by immunostaining of p53 and hemoglobin F and karyotype analysis: differential diagnosis between refractory anemia and aplastic anemia.P53 mutation has been reported in various solid tumors, acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but the diagnostic significance of p53 in MDS remains to be determined. The purpose of the present paper was to examine p53 mutation and immunostaining of the same patients, because there have been few reports of simultaneous analysis of these markers. Seven p53 mutations were observed among 37 MDS and 11 cases of overt leukemia transformed from MDS (MDS-OL). Mutated p53 mainly observed in high-risk MDS had more intense p53 staining than in MDS with wild-type p53 overexpression. Aplastic anemia (AA) produced no p53 staining. The percentage of p53 staining in MDS (71%) was higher than that of mutated p53 (11%) but did not reach 100% of MDS cases studied, therefore the authors attempted to differentiate MDS, especially refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and AA, using a combination of p53 immunostaining, hemoglobin F (HbF) immunostaining and chromosome abnormality, because HbF of erythroblasts was reportedly observed in MDS RA but not in AA. Most MDS/MDS-OL (47/48) had at least one positive marker. Among 11 AA cases, only two were positive for HbF. The present results suggest that the combination of these three markers is useful to discriminate MDS from AA.",M1
18476419,"[Effect of treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome by Qinghuang Powder combined with Chinese herbs for reinforcing shen and strenghening pi]OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of Qinghuang Powder combined with Chinese herbs for reinforcing Shen and strenghening Pi in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: fifty-five patients with diagnosis fitting to MDS were treated with Qinghuang Powder and decoction for strengthening Pi and reinforcing Shen, in combination with Stanozololum. RESULTS: Eleven patients (20.0%) out of the 55 were completely remitted (CR), the total effective rate being 74.5% (41/55 cases). By FAB typing, 9 (26. 5%) in the 34 patients of type <e>RA</e>/RAS were CR, with the total effective rate of 82.4% (28/34 cases), and in the 21 patients of type RAEB, 9.5% (2/21 cases) were CR with the total effective rate of 61.9% (13/21 cases), showing insignificant statistical difference between the two types (P &gt; 0.05). By international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), the treatment was evaluated as CR in 10 patients, effective in 25 and ineffective in 11 in 36 patients of moderate risk group I , the responding numbers were 1, 4, 2 in 7 patients of moderate risk group II and 0, 3, 3 in 6 patients of high risk group, respectively, also showing insignificant difference between groups (P &gt; 0.05). Levels of Hb, WBC and platelet significantly increased after treatment (P &lt; 0. 05). By cytogenetics, the effective rate was 68.8% (11/16 cases) in patients with abnormal chromosome and 72.7% (24/33 cases) in those with normal chromosome, with insignificant difference (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The comprehensive therapy with TCM treatment for reinforcing Shen and dissolving stasis in dominance has a definite clinical effect in treating MDS, it was not significantly associated with FAB typing, IPSS score, and chromosome abnormality of patients.",M1
18430715,"DNA instability in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes: refractory anemia with or without ring sideroblasts.We tested genomic instability in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the comet assay and verified the suitability of this approach as a tool for analysis of ineffective hematopoiesis in refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS). Erythroid and myeloid cell populations from bone marrow aspirates of 20 RA, 14 RARS and 15 control subjects were separated by differential expression of glycophorin A and subjected to comet assay. The extent of DNA migration was measured in single cells (200 cells/bone marrow fraction/subject). The results were in agreement with the concept of increased apoptosis in low-risk MDS subtypes. The RA samples had a significantly higher DNA instability than controls in glycophorin A positive cells, and the extent of DNA breakage correlated with the degree of cytopenia. Although RARS had an even higher rate of genomic instability in bone marrow cells than RA, there was no clear relationship to peripheral cytopenia. This suggests an additional DNA instability of non-apoptotic origin. Whether this increase is associated with an increased repair of oxidative damage in DNA arising due to iron deposits in ring sideroblasts remains to be formally proven. Comet assay provides a promising tool for the investigation of difference between RA and RARS pathobiology.",M1
18398482,"The role of the iron transporter ABCB7 in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts.Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts (RARS) is an acquired myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by an excess iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroblasts. The pathogenesis of RARS and the cause of this unusual pattern of iron deposition remain unknown. We considered that the inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) might be informative for the acquired disorder, RARS. XLSA/A is caused by partial inactivating mutations of the ABCB7 ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, which functions to enable transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ABCB7 gene silencing in HeLa cells causes an accumulation of iron in the mitochondria. We have studied the role of ABCB7 in RARS by DNA sequencing, methylation studies, and gene expression studies in primary CD34(+) cells and in cultured erythroblasts. The DNA sequence of the ABCB7 gene is normal in patients with RARS. We have investigated ABCB7 gene expression levels in the CD34(+) cells of 122 MDS cases, comprising 35 patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 33 patients with RARS and 54 patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and in the CD34(+) cells of 16 healthy controls. We found that the expression levels of ABCB7 are significantly lower in the RARS group. RARS is thus characterized by lower levels of ABCB7 gene expression in comparison to other MDS subtypes. Moreover, we find a strong relationship between increasing percentage of bone marrow ring sideroblasts and decreasing ABCB7 gene expression levels. Erythroblast cell cultures confirm the low levels of ABCB7 gene expression levels in RARS. These data provide an important link between inherited and acquired forms of sideroblastic anemia and indicate that ABCB7 is a strong candidate gene for RARS.",M1
18351340,"Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes: a meta-analysis.The present meta-analysis was undertaken to (1) assess erythroid response rates in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients treated with epoetin alfa as a monotherapy, (2) gain further insights into predictors of response rates, and (3) compare the erythroid response rates observed with epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa. A systematic review of studies from 1990 to 2006 in MDS patients treated with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa was performed and yielded 30 studies evaluating a total of 1,314 patients (epoetin alfa: 22 studies, 925 patients; darbepoetin alfa: eight studies, 389 patients). Pooled estimates of erythroid response rates, stratified by the International Working Group criteria (IWGc) and treatment group, were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis methods. Univariate meta-regression analyses were further conducted to identify study characteristics associated with erythroid response rate. The pooled estimate of erythroid response rate was significantly higher for epoetin alfa IWGc studies (57.6%) as compared to non-IWGc studies (31.6%; p &lt; 0.001). Study factors predictive of higher response rate in the epoetin alfa IWGc studies included higher proportion of patients with <e>RA</e>/RARS (p &lt; 0.001), lower mean baseline serum erythropoietin level (p = 0.007), and fixed dosing regimen (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in the pooled erythroid response rates between the two agents (epoetin alfa: 57.6% vs. darbepoetin alfa: 59.4%; p = 0.828). The current study reported significantly higher erythroid response rates predominantly in the more recent studies that primarily utilized IWGc to define response. With the use of standardized patient selection and response evaluation methods, epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa yielded comparable erythroid response rates in MDS patients.",M1
18241656,"[Effects of Yisui Jiedu Recipe on JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction pathway in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Yisui Jiedu Recipe (YSJDR), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on cytokines and their corresponding just another kinase 2-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (JAK2-STAT5) signal transduction pathway in bone marrow hematopoietic cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>). METHODS: Fluorogenic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) method was established to detect the levels of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNA expressions, and JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction pathway was activated by granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in cultured bone marrow hematopoietic cells from 10 patients with MDS-RA. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), gamma-interferon (gamma-INF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the cultural supernatant of untreated control, AG490-treated and YSJDF-treated cells were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha in YSJDR-treated group were significantly lower than those in untreated control group and AG490-treated group (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05), and IL-3 level in YSJDP-treated group was remarkably higher than that in the other two groups (P&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2 and IL-3 between AG490-treated group and untreated control group (P&gt;0.05), while the TNF-alpha level in AG490-treated group was decreased obviously as compared with the untreated control group (P&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in gamma-INF level between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group (P&gt;0.05), while TNF-alpha level in the two groups were significantly lower than that in the untreated control group (P&lt;0.01). The expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNAs were significantly down-regulated in the YSJDR-treated and the AG490-treated groups as compared with those in the untreated control group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), while there were no differences in the expressions of JAK2, STAT5 and Bcl-xL mRNAs between YSJDR-treated group and AG490-treated group. CONCLUSION: YSJDR can modulate cytokine level in bone marrow hematopoietic cells of MDS-RA, suppress JAK2-STAT5 signal transduction, and inhibit the Bcl-xL mRNA expression.",M1
18094713,"Comparison of hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with normo-/hypercellular MDS by International Prognostic Scoring System, cytogenetic and genetic studies.The differences in clinical features and prognosis between hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (h-MDS) and normo-/hypercellular MDS (NH-MDS) remain unsettled. In this study, the characteristics of 37 h-MDS patients and 152 NH-MDS patients were compared. Peripheral-blood white blood cell counts and bone marrow blast percentage were lower in h-MDS patients than in NH-MDS patients (P=0.012 and 0.016, respectively). Refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) was predominant (56.8%) in h-MDS, whereas RA with excess of blast (RAEB) was most common (44.7%) in NH-MDS. Chromosomal abnormalities -7/7q- occurred less frequently in h-MDS patients than in NH-MDS patients (0 vs 18.3%, P=0.022). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of mutations of RAS, AML1, JAK2, PTPN11, FLT3/ITD, and hypermethylation of SOCS1 and SHP1 between these two groups. International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was ideal for predicting prognoses in h-MDS patients (P=0.002). In low- or intermediate-1 (Int-1)-risk MDS patients, h-MDS patients had a superior survival than NH-MDS patients (P=0.01). In conclusion, distinct from NH-MDS, h-MDS patients have different patterns of hemogram, distribution of French-American-British subtypes, cytogenetic changes and prognoses. IPSS is applicable in h-MDS as in NH-MDS. In patients with low- or Int-1-risk MDS, h-MDS patients have a better prognosis than NH-MDS patients.",M1
17412418,"Presence of peripheral blasts in refractory anemia and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia predicts an unfavourable outcome.The World Health Organization (WHO) assigns myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to <e>RA</e>/RCMD/RARS/RSCM/5q- syndrome, if medullary blasts are &lt;5% and peripheral blast (PB) count &lt; or =1%. In 1103 patients with these diagnoses, we analysed survival and risk of AML evolution depending on the presence of PB. Median survival in the group with 1% PB (n=74) was significantly lower as compared to those without PB (20 versus 47 months, p&lt;0.00005). Cumulative risk of AML was significantly higher in patients showing PB (p&lt;0.00005). Median survival of patients with PB was not different from that of RAEB I. We therefore propose to consider patients with PB, regardless of medullary blast, as RAEB I.",M1
17229631,"Anti-erythroblast autoimmunity in early myelodysplastic syndromes.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune phenomena, mainly directed against red blood cells are described in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), particularly early MDS, i.e. refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). Dysregulation of apoptosis and immunoregulatory cytokines are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS. DESIGN AND METHODS: This work was aimed to investigate anti-erythroid autoimmunity in unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood and bone marrow cultures of 26 patients with early MDS (RA and RARS), and to relate its presence with apoptotic markers and cytokine production. Bone marrow cytokine production in culture supernatants, and caspase-3 and nuclear factor-kappaB activity in cell extracts were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 26 (53.8%) patients showed the presence of autoantibodies in bone marrow cultures, whereas none displayed a positive direct antiglobulin test in peripheral blood cultures. Incubation of culture supernatants from positive patients with autologous CD45- enriched-cell suspensions showed that the autoimmune reaction was directed against autologous erythroblasts. These patients had mild signs of hemolysis and increased numbers of erythroblasts, compared with negative patients. Patients with anti-erythroblast autoimmunity displayed higher caspase-3 activity and lower tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4 production than did negative patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients with early MDS showed autoimmunity against erythroblasts. This evidence might support a more rationale use of steroid therapy in these patients. The lower levels of cytokines in patients with anti-erythroblast autoimmunity are consistent with the suggested hypothesis that the autoimmune phenomena observed in MDS are probably initiated and perpetuated through alterations of pro-inflammatory and/or immunoregulatory cytokine production.",M1
17188353,"Immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells in myelodysplastic syndromes of subtypes refractory anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts display an altered cytokine profile.Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal for T cell-mediated immunity. We investigated the early and terminal maturation of monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) in myelodysplastic syndromes (FAB subtypes refractory anemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (MDS-RARS)). Immature MoDC were obtained by culture of monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 8 days. To obtain mature MoDC, TNF-alpha was added during the final three culture days. T cell proliferation and T cell cytokine secretion in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) unveiled a strong reduction of allostimulatory capacity of mature but also of immature MoDC from MDS patients. Immature MoDC from MDS patients exhibited an almost normal immunophenotype, but secreted substantially less IL-12 and more IL-10 in response to LPS/IFN-gamma than normal controls. Terminal addition of TNF-alpha to GM-CSF/IL-4 treated monocytes failed to extinguish cytokine production by MDS MoDC and failed to induce the expected membrane upregulation of costimulatory and other ligands as in normal controls. While our data provide further support for previous studies that have indicated an impaired differentiation of immature towards mature MoDC, they also clearly demonstrate a qualitatively and quantitatively altered cytokine secretion at the level of immature MoDC, which may in part explain the reduced allostimulatory capacity of these cells. These alterations may contribute to immune modulation of the clinical phenotype of marrow failure in MDS, and may have to be considered when designing DC-based immunotherapeutic strategies for MDS.",M1
16995421,"[Auto- and alloreactivity of T lymphocytes in myelodysplastic syndrome]BACKGROUND: Successful therapy with ATG and cyclosporine A in some myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients led us to study the existence of T cells attacking autologous hemopoietic cells. In our study, we attempted to give the direct prove of autoreactive T cells in MDS (autoreactivity analysis). Simultaneously, we analysed the capacity of MDS patients to respond to allogeneic cells from unrelated individuals (alloreactivity analysis). METHODS AND RESULTS: Autoreactive lymphocytes directed against own bone marrow mononuclear cells were analysed using the modification of cell mediated cytotoxic reaction. With one exception we did not confirm the presence of autoreactive T cells among 10 patients examined. Analysis of alloreactivity was performed by means of standard cell mediated cytotoxic reaction and mixed lymphocyte reaction. Surprisingly, the cytotoxic response to allogeneic cells was negative in 11 MDS patients from 16 analysed. When comparing refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>) and refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) patients, the proportion of negative results was higher in RA (78 %) than in RARS (40 %). In mixed lymphocyte reaction, the response of MDS cells to allogeneic cells of unrelated individual was positive in all tested patients. The preliminary testing of TNF and IFNgamma secretion examined in supernatants of effector cells showed impaired levels of both cytokines in RA and normal levels in RARS in accordance with the findings achieved in alloreactivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Autoreactive T cells were not found in MDS patients using our experimental arrangement. Analysis of alloreactivity showed the defect in effector--cytotoxic--phase of cell mediated cytotoxic reaction in the majority of MDS patients. The initial phase of this reaction represented in vitro by mixed lymphocyte reaction gave normal results. The possible reasons of disturbed alloreactivity and its relevance to immunity in MDS are commented in discussion.",M1

We report here two such cases diagnosed as Refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>) and Refractory anaemia with excess blast (RAEB) who had marked suppression of the erythroid cell lines. Both patients presented with severe transfusion dependent anaemia.

16690517,"The efficacy of unrelated cord blood transplantation for adult myelodysplastic syndrome.Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical related donor offers a potential cure for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a suitably matched related donor is unavailable for approximately two thirds of patients. Recently, umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors have been used as an alternative stem cell source for adult patients with MDS. Here, we updated the results of unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) after myeloablative conditioning for 22 adult patients with MDS. Diagnosis at transplantation included refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) (n = 3), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n = 2), RAEB-t (n = 2), and MDS-related secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 15). All patients were treated with total body irradiation (12 Gy), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and cyclophosphamide followed by unrelated HLA-mismatched CBT. The median age was 40 years (range, 19 - 51 years), the median weight was 54.5 kg (range, 43 - 75 kg), and the median number of cryopreserved nucleated cells was 2.43 x 10(7)/kg (range, 1.82 - 4.10 x 10(7)/kg). Twenty one patients had myeloid reconstitution and the median time to more than 0.5 x 10(9)/l absolute neutrophil count was 22.5 days. A self-sustained platelet count more than 50 x 10(9)/l was achieved in 19 patients at a median time of 49 days. Acute GVHD above grade II occurred in seven of 21 evaluable patients and chronic GVHD in 16 of 19 evaluable patients. Among 16 chronic GVHD patients, in eight patients the disease was extensive. Seventeen patients are alive and free of disease at between 371 and 2562 days after transplantation. With a median follow-up of 1505 days, the probability of disease-free survival at 4 years was 76.0%. These results suggest that adult MDS patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.",M1
16540422,"Erythropoietin administration may potentiate mobilization of storage iron in patients on oral iron chelation therapy.Five, repeatedly transfused, patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) or RA with ringed sideroblast (RARS) subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with serum ferritin (SF) levels of &gt; 2,000 microg/L, and one female with Hb E [beta26(B8)Glu --&gt; Lys]/beta0-thalassemia (thal) with an SF level of 1,760 microg/ L, were treated with deferiprone (L1) at the dose of 4-6 g per day for at least 26 months. Beginning in the second month, all patients received recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) at the dose of 150 IU/kg thrice weekly, subcutaneously for 24 months. A significant increase in iron excretion after combined administration of L1 and rHuEPO compared to treatment with L1 as a single agent, was observed in all patients. The amount of excreted iron in urine ranged from 7.5 to almost 20 mg per day. In one patient, a response to rHuEPO resulted in transfusion independence and her SF decreased from 2086 to 879 microg/L. In four MDS patients, who remained dependent on red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, simultaneous administration of L1 and rHuEPO enabled the stabilization of SF levels, despite continuing iron load from the transfusions. Combined administration of rHuEPO and oral iron chelators may potentiate mobilization of storage iron and maintain iron balance in transfusion-dependent iron overloaded early MDS patients.",M1

The daily treatment protocol comprised all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (30 mg/m(2)), calcitriol (0.1 microg/m(2)), and androgen (stanozolol 3mg/m(2), or danazol 300 mg/m(2)) in three separate doses for eight consecutive weeks. Hematologic improvement was observed in 43 (68.3%) patients. The treatment administered was generally well tolerated, with no severe regimen-related toxicity. The overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 68.72% and 53.18%, respectively. These results indicate that this combination regimen is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with RA.",M1
16423393,"Classification and scoring systems in myelodysplastic syndromes: a retrospective analysis of 311 patients.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the role of the recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification for assessing prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To this effect, we analyzed the prognostic impact of the WHO and French-American-British (FAB) morphologic classifications and of four different scoring systems in a series of 311 patients with primary MDS diagnosed between October 1990 and June 2001. Both the FAB and WHO classifications identified groups with different prognoses (p&lt;0.0001), those presenting refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) showing the best prognosis. The WHO classification subdivided RA into RA with only red cell dysplasia, and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), and RARS into RARS plus refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblast (RCMD-RS). In our population, we have shown that the two subtypes characterized by dysplasia affecting exclusively the erythroid population (RA and RARS) have a better prognosis, with a median survival of 122.2 and 81.9 months, respectively, than those with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD and RCMD-RS) with a median survival of 32.3 and 43.2 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in median survival comparing RA with RAS (p&lt;0.95), or comparing RCMD with RSCMD (p&lt;0.97). Besides, the four scoring systems discriminated our MDS patients in terms of survival, and an increase in prognostic capacity was achieved on adding the score to the morphological classifications. Risk scoring had a greater prognostic impact than the FAB and WHO classifications. Prognostic scoring systems may be an important tool for risk stratification in hematological practice, and add significance to morphological classification. Combined application of the WHO classification and score system is useful for improving the identification of patients with a poorer prognosis. The WHO classification establishes more homogeneous subcategories than the FAB classification and is also able to identify groups with different prognoses.",M1
16277860,"[Cyclosporine A based therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome]To determine the efficacy and tolerance to cyclosporine A (CsA) based therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 16 patients with MDS consisting of 10 refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and 6 refractory anemia with accessory blasts less than 10% (RAEB-1) were analyzed. Five patients had hypocellular bone marrows and 11 patients had normocellular or hypercellular marrows. The dose of CsA was 2.5-5.5 mg/(kg.d) for 2 weeks to 2 years (mean 8 months). Two out of 16 patients were treated with CsA alone, 14 patients were treated with CsA, recombinant human erythropoietin, androgens, 1, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D(3) or two or three of them combination with CsA. Treatment responses were classified according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), hematological improvement (HI) and no response (NR). Patients who obtained CR, PR or HI were defined as responders. The results showed that HI was observed in 12 patients, PR in 2 patients and NR in 2 patients. Total response rate was 87.5%. Response rates shown in neutrophil lineage, platelet and erythroid lineage were 83.3%, 66.7% and 60%, respectively; their shortest time required to obtain some hematologic improvement after initiation of CsA therapy was 2 weeks, 1 month and 1 month, respectively. Of 13 patients being transfusion-dependent before treatment, 3 patients did not need transfusion any more and 5 showed the reduced transfusion requirements after CsA therapy. In 10 patients with RA, 9 responded to CsA. Of 6 patients with RAEB, 1 patient had no response and died of RAEB-t and 5 patients had transient responses. One of the latter transformed to CMML and two relapsed. The total response rate decreased to 50% in the patients with CsA therapy lasting more than 3 months at the end of following-up. The adverse effects included hirsutism, hyperplastic gingiva, reversible hepatic and renal dysfunction. In conclusion, the usefulness of CsA based therapy for MDS-RA and RAEB-1 with any marrow cellularity is useful, the CsA dose of 3-5 mg/(kg.d) is safe and efficacious.",M1
16277859,"[Retrospective observation of curative effects on MDS refractory anemia with combination of all-trans retinoic acid, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and androgen]This study was aimed to examine whether a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and androgen possesses the therapeutic value for the MDS-refractory anemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>), and to analyze the mechanisms in detail. 62 cases receiving a scheme of combination of ATRA, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and androgen (group A) were monitored. The remaining 33 cases (group B) were provided with vitamin supplementation, chalybeate drugs, and one or two of the combination. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed for collecting the specimens at the baseline and afterwards. The conditions of the patients were monitored by means of weekly complete blood counts and the monthly examination, including toxicity test, physical examination, electrocardiography, and biochemistry panel. The results showed that after treating for 8 weeks in group A, 4 out of 62 patients showed complete remission and 12 patients showed partial remission according to the defined response criteria, and 43 patients (69.35%) showed hematological improvement (HI). The further treatment for 16 out of 62 patients (25.81%), 13 failures (10 deaths, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(5)) with a median survival interval of 26.25 months, were observed and interrupted for some reasons. However, partial remission was observed only in 3 patients in group B, and HI amounted to 51.51%. Furthermore, the disease progression was observed in 12 out of 33 patients (36.36%) with a median survival interval of 16 months, 9 failures (including 6 deaths, 2 RAEB and 1 RAEB-T) and 3 transformations (M(2), M(3), M(4)). The overall ratios of survival for 3 and 5 years in group A, which received the combination, reached to 69.24% and 53.72% respectively, in comparison with 52.23% and 31.34% in the patients of group B (log-rank, P = 0.016). The following requirements, if were met, would be significant for prognosis: the combination regiment, no transformation, children, no complication, female, 90-120 g/L of hemoglobin concentration, normal cellular bone marrow and uni-cytopenias (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, Cox regression showed that therapy, transformation and age are all the independent factors (P &lt; 0.05). It is concluded that the combination of above mentioned 3 drugs may be effective and safe treatment for the patients with MDS-RA. Its relevant mechanisms can be involved in the combination, that elicits a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as differentiation, anti-tumor-promotion, anti-apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-cachexia and immunoregulation.",M1
16160010,"Bmi-1 is useful as a novel molecular marker for predicting progression of myelodysplastic syndrome and patient prognosis.The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) has been widely used to predict the prognosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, IPSS does not always provide a sufficiently precise evaluation of patients to allow the appropriate choice of clinical interventions. Here, we analyzed the expression of Bmi-1, which is required to regulate the self-renewal in CD34+ cells from 51 patients with cases of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia preceded by MDS (MDS-AML). Higher positivity rate of Bmi-1 was preferentially seen in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and MDS-AML compared with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). IPSS score was positively correlated with the percentage of Bmi-1 expression. Patients with RA and RARS with a higher percentage of Bmi-1+ cells showed disease progression to RAEB. Here, we propose Bmi-1 as a novel molecular marker to predict the progression and prognosis of MDS.",M1

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was infused continuously, starting 12 hours before Ara-C therapy and continuing until the end of Ara-C therapy. All patients received standard cyclosporine and methotrexate therapy as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. All patients had myeloid reconstitution, and the times to reach an absolute neutrophil count &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/L were 23, 20, and 26 days. All patients showed full donor chimerism at the time of the first bone marrow examination (on day +42, +43, and +62) after CBT. All patients are alive and free of disease at between 17 and 39 months after CBT. These results suggest that adult MDS-RA patients without suitable related or unrelated bone marrow donors should be considered as candidates for CBT.",M1
16144933,"Antiapoptotic role of growth factors in the myelodysplastic syndromes: concordance between in vitro and in vivo observations.PURPOSE: Erythroid apoptosis in low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) maybe mediated via mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation. In the present study, we compared the in vitro and in vivo effects of proerythroid treatment with erythropoietin + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on myelodysplastic erythropoiesis regarding apoptosis and preferential growth of clones with cytogenetic abnormalities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled 15 refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and 11 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), including 5q- aberration, monosomy 7, and trisomy 8, before initiation of treatment and followed nine patients after successful treatment. The effects of G-CSF and erythropoietin were assessed. The expression of G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) was explored during erythroid maturation. The relative growth of erythroid progenitors with cytogenetic aberrations in presence of erythropoietin was investigated. RESULTS: Significant redistribution of cytochrome c was seen before treatment at all stages of erythroid differentiation. This release was blocked by G-CSF during the whole culture period and by erythropoietin during the latter phase. Both freshly isolated glycophorin A+ bone marrow cells and intermediate erythroblasts during cultivation retained their expression of G-CSFR. Cytochrome c release and caspase activation were significantly less pronounced in progenitors obtained from successfully treated nonanemic patients and showed no further response to G-CSF in vitro. Moreover, erythropoietin significantly promoted growth of cytogenetically normal cells from 5q- patients, whereas no such effect was observed on erythroblasts from monosomy 7 or trisomy 8 patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that growth factors such as erythropoietin and G-CSF can act both via inhibition of apoptosis of myelodysplastic erythroid precursors and via selection of cytogenetically normal progenitors.",M1
15972453,"Difference in clinical features between Japanese and German patients with refractory anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes.Several reports indicate that there might be differences in clinical features between Asian and Western myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. We analyzed refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) in French-American-British (FAB) classification cases diagnosed in Japan and Germany to perform a more exact comparison between Asian and Western MDS types. In the first step, we analyzed agreement of morphologic diagnosis between Japanese and German hematologists. Blood and bone marrow slides of 129 patients diagnosed with FAB-RA, FAB-RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), or aplastic anemia were selected randomly and evaluated separately by each group. The agreements of diagnoses according to FAB and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications were 98.4% and 83.8%, respectively. Second, we compared clinical features between 131 Japanese and 597 German patients with FAB-RA. Japanese patients were significantly younger than German patients. Japanese patients had more severe cytopenias. However, prognosis of Japanese patients was significantly more favorable than that of German patients. Japanese patients had a significantly lower cumulative risk of acute leukemia evolution than did German patients. Frequency of WHO-RA in Japanese patients with FAB-RA was significantly higher than that in German patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that the clinical features of Japanese patients with FAB-RA differ from those of German patients.",M1
15860935,"Clinical importance of transforming growth factor-beta but not of tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene polymorphisms in patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome belonging to the refractory anemia subtype.OBJECTIVES: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are cytokines that play key roles in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta1 protein, located in codon 10 in exon 1 and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to MDS and the progression of the disease among patients with MDS belonging to the refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) subtype. METHODS: The diagnosis of MDS (n = 50) was based on the FAB criteria. The TNF-alpha genotypes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP and the TGF-beta genotypes were analyzed using an amplification refractory mutation system. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with RA showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha. The TT homozygosity at codon 10 of TGF-beta1 was significantly higher among patients with bi- or pancytopenia (severe group) than in the patients with anemia only (mild group; odds ratio = 6.99, p = 0.003). These findings suggest that the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism in codon 10 and the -308 TNF-alpha gene polymorphism do not predispose to the development of RA, but the TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism may affect disease progression.",M1
15809884,"Cyclosporin A in myelodysplastic syndrome: a preliminary report.Therapeutic approaches are not well established in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We evaluated response to cyclosporin A (CyA) in 19 cases with MDS who were enrolled for the study [13 refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 5 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), and 1 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS)]. Bone marrow was normocellular in ten, hypercellular in five, and hypocellular in four cases. Fifteen patients were transfusion dependent and the rest were not transfusion dependent but with a hemoglobin range of 6.4-8.8 g% with a mean of 7.4 g%. CyA was given at a dose of 3-5 mg/kg per day. A major response was observed in seven patients with RA, which was sustained on follow-up. Four cases of RA showed minor response and two cases of RA did not respond to CyA therapy. A minor response was also seen in one RAEB and one RARS case, while one RAEB case that initially showed a major response relapsed on therapy. The first effect of therapy was evident after a mean period of 2.5 months. A rise in platelets and leukocyte count was seen in three and two cases, respectively. One case developed renal failure on therapy and later died of septicemia. Response to CyA was independent of bone marrow cellularity. CyA could be an effective mode of therapy in patients with MDS especially those having RA.",M1
15725470,"The presence of clonal cell subpopulations in peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia but not in patients with refractory anemia may reflect a multistep pathogenesis of myelodysplasia.A clonal origin of hematopoiesis was studied by investigation of X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP) in isolated granulocyte, CD14(+) and CD3(+) subpopulations obtained from bone marrow and peripheral blood of 36 female patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Clonality was assessed by PCR amplification of polymorphic short tandem repeats of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene and by investigation of silent polymorphism of iduronate sulphatase (IDS) or p55 genes. On the basis of results in a control group of 20 healthy age related females, a ratio of at least 9:1 between the two alleles was considered a significant marker of monoclonal hematopoiesis. Ten of the 11 patients with advanced forms of MDS (RAEB, RAEB-T, CMML) had clonal granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood. In patients with early disease, only 2 out of 11 patients (18%) with <e>RA</e> or RARS, according to WHO classification, had clonal granulocytes and CD14(+) cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow and 2 other patients with 5q-syndrome exhibited extremely oligoclonal granulocyte subpopulation in bone marrow. In contrast, we found clonal granulocytes in 12 out of 14 patients (86%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) and 8 of them simultanously exhibited clonal CD14(+) cells. Estimated 3 years survival of patients with early disease and clonal cell subpopulations was 61% as compared with 88% in patients without clonal hematopoiesis. Karyotype abnormalities were detected in 11 of the 25 females with early disease. Clonal patterns were present in 7 out of 8 patients with abberations diagnosed by routine cytogenetics, nevertheless, FISH revealed 5q deletion in 3 patients without signs of clonality in XCIP assay. No correlation was found between the presence of clonal subpopulations and the degree of telomere shortening in early MDS. Despite some limitations, the measurement of XCIP remains a sensitive tool for diagnosis of the first transforming mutation in the clonal development of MDS especially when combined with FISH and when an age related group is used to establish an appropriate allele ratio to exclude constitutional or acquired skewing. The occurrence of clonal cell subpopulations in most of the RCMD patients in contrast to RA may reflect a proposed multistep pathogenesis of MDS with dysplastic changes limited to erythropoiesis in early step and with subsequent development of multilineage dysplasia. The results also support the usefulness of separation of RCMD from 'pure' RA; however, a more complex insight combining different molecular techniques performed in a large number of patients is needed for refined classification of MDS on the basis of new molecular prognostic factors and for indication of more effective targeted therapy.",M1

The present study was designed to assess whether functional iron deficiency may develop in MDS patients receiving these treatments. DESIGN AND METHODS: Erythrocyte scattergrams from 34 patients with RA and RARS (untreated, transfused, or GF-treated with partial or complete erythroid response) were analyzed with Bayer-Advia equipment. RESULTS: In untreated RARS, the proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes (Hypo-e, median 6.2%, range 1.1-8%) and hypochromic reticulocytes (Hypo-r, median 45%, range 22-48%), as well as mean corpuscular volume (MCV, median 101 fL) were significantly elevated compared to corresponding values in controls. These values increased further after GF-treatment (median 11%, 57%, and 105 fL, respectively), in spite of improved hemoglobin values and adequate body iron stores. The values observed in untreated RA patients largely fell within the normal range, and there was no significant influence of GF treatment. Notably, the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (MCHr) did not differ between MDS and controls, and was not influenced by GF treatment. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The red cell population in RARS shows morphological abnormalities in terms of varying but overall increased size, and reduced hemoglobin concentration. The proportion of abnormal cells increases after successful pro-erythroid GF treatment, indicating that GF promote erythroblast survival, and maturation into erythrocytes. Hence, the finding of hypochromic red cells should not routinely be interpreted as a marker for Epo-induced functional iron deficiency in MDS.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow smears from 31 patients with MDS-refractory anemia (RA) and five normal controls were stained using the in situ end labeling (ISEL) method. Next, the inhibitory effects of a caspase-3 inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI), anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or anti-Fas antibody upon the apoptosis induction in overnight cultures of bone marrow cells from the patients were examined. Further, TNF-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) concentrations in culture supernatants of the cells were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The incidence of ISEL-positive cells among MDS patients was significantly higher than in normal controls (50.8 +/- 14.0% vs. 11.3 +/- 2.4%; P &lt; 0.0001). A caspase-3 inhibitor reduced significantly the ISEL-positive rates (32.6 +/- 15.2% vs. 50.2 +/- 16.5%; P &lt; 0.0001). Anti-TNF-alpha or anti-Fas antibody reduced the ISEL-positive rates significantly (28.2 +/- 6.0%, 29.2 +/- 5.8%, vs. 44.2 +/- 3.4%, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.001, respectively). KB-R7785 also significantly decreased the ISEL-positive rates (18.0 +/- 9.3% vs. 43.6 +/- 14.0%; P &lt; 0.0001). The concentration of TNF-alpha was significantly reduced by KB-R7785 (P &lt; 0.05), whereas that of TGF-beta was not. Concentration of sFasL was under detectable level in the present assay system. The derivatives of KB-R7785 that can be administrated orally showed inhibitory effect on apoptosis induction as well. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that MMPIs inhibits the apoptosis induction of MDS bone marrow cells via the inhibition of TNF-alpha and probably sFasL secretion, and that MMPIs can be used to control the abnormal induction of apoptosis in MDS.",M1

15149150,"Successful treatment of refractory anemia with a combination regimen containing recombinant human erythropoietin, low-dose methylprednisolone and nandrolone.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of hematological clonal malignancies. Patients belonging to the refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) subtype are usually treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). Not all patients respond to EPO administration and they are strictly dependent on supportive therapy with red cell blood (RBC) transfusions. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an alternative combination regimen containing EPO, low-dose methylprednisolone and nandrolone decanoate, in patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone. Ten patients, 4 women and 6 men, median age: 70 years (range: 55-78 years) with refractory anemia unresponsive to EPO administration and RBC transfusion-dependent were included in the study. Median hematological data at baseline were Hb: 8.7 g/dl, (range 6.2-9.8), WBC: 3.35x10(9)/l (range 2.1-4), PLT: 82.5x10(9)/l (range 59-110). EPO 150 U/Kg three times/week subcutaneously, low-dose methylprednisolone 8 mg/day orally and nandrolone decanoate (Decadurabolin) 50 mg two-times/week intramuscularly were administered. As complete response (CR) to treatment was considered the normalization of the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and biopsy. As partial response (PR) was considered increase in Hb level &gt; or = 2 g/dl, or up to 10 g/dl and discontinuation of RBC transfusions. The response to therapy was evaluated on the 4th week after the initiation of the combination treatment. Bone marrow smear evaluation was carried out at baseline and every six months afterwards. After a 4-week treatment all patients achieved PR and discontinued RBC transfusions. Median and range hematological values on the 4th week after treatment initiation were Hb: 11.2 g/dl, (range: 9.8-12.8), WBC: 4.4x10(9)/l (3.5-6.6), PLT: 130x10(9)/l (95-160). The increase observed in hematological values was significant (p = 0.0001, 0.0004 and &lt; 0.0001, respectively, for Hb, WBC and PLT counts). Treatment was well tolerated. Furthermore, two women, on treatment with the combination regimen, achieved CR one after six months and the second after 12 months. They are alive after 5 years from initiation of the combination treatment. After a median period of 18 months (range 12 to 20 months) in PR three men developed acute leukemia; they received intensive antileukemic chemotherapy without any response and died during the phase of pancytopenia. Three other men achieved CR, one after 6 and two after 12 months of therapy and they are on regular follow-up. Two women after 10 and 14 months in PR developed acute leukemia and died. In conclusion, combination therapy with EPO, nandrolone decanoate and low-dose methylprednisolone may be effective as an alternative treatment for RBC transfusion-dependent patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone.",M1
15120935,"Factors influencing survival in myelodysplastic syndromes in a Brazilian population: comparison of FAB and WHO classifications.The WHO classification for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has introduced new categories with prognostic relevance. Our aim was to examine the predictive value of the WHO and the FAB classification compared to parameters of peripheral blood, bone marrow and IPSS. Clinical data, peripheral blood counts, bone marrow (BM) cytology and histology and survival were analyzed in consecutive newly diagnosed adult patients with MDS. All cases were diagnosed according to FAB criteria and reclassified by the WHO proposal. Among 150 patients entering the study median age was 58 years (12-90). According to FAB, 90 patients had refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 18 sideroblastic anemia, 34 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), three RAEB-t and five chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Using the WHO proposal, one half of the patients with RA changed category. One patient had the 5q-syndrome. There were 25 cases with refractory cytopenias with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) and 23 WHO  unclassified . These last patients presented few cell atypias, favorable IPSS and a good survival as has been described for refractory cytopenias in pediatric MDS. Hypocellular BM was found in 24% of the patients. Karyotype was available in only 85 cases. In the univariate analysis, both classifications, hemoglobin values, hypercellular bone marrow and IPSS had an influence on survival. Using the bootstrap resampling as stability test for the model created by the multivariate analysis, the WHO classification entered the model in 73%, FAB in 38% and IPSS in only 7%. Therefore, in a setting with a high number of low-risk MDS, the WHO classification is the best predictor of survival of the patients.",M1
15120930,"Combined stratification of refractory anemia according to both WHO and IPSS criteria has a prognostic impact and improves identification of patients who may benefit from stem cell transplantation.A retrospective analysis of the relationship between the initial classification according to either FAB or WHO criteria, the presence of risk factors and the type of therapy including stem cell transplantation (SCT) on the survival was performed in a group of 106 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of FAB <e>RA</e> subtype. Allogeneic SCT early in the course of the disease did not significantly affect median survival in RA patients evaluated either according to FAB criteria (63.2 months in 17 SCT patients versus 64.4 months in 89 non-transplanted (non-SCT) patients) or in subgroups classified separately according to WHO (64.0 months in SCT versus 91.0 months in non-SCT RA patients and 66.2 months in SCT versus 43.0 months in non-SCT refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) patients) or International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria despite decreased incidence of leukemic transformation (5% in SCT versus 32% in non-SCT patients). Neither univariate or multivariate analysis of different clinical and laboratory parameters revealed a significant effect of SCT on 3 or 5 years survival in RA patients. The most probable explanation was a relatively high rate of transplantation related mortality (41%) on one hand together with a slow disease progression towards leukemia (24% at 5 years in non-SCT) on the other hand. A more refined stratification of patients based on the combined WHO morphology classification and IPSS cytogenetic criteria revealed subgroup of 11 non-SCT patients with RCMD and poor karyotype with median survival significantly different from that in five SCT patients (9.2 months in non-SCT versus 89.3 months in SCT, P=0.05). Thus, combined WHO morphology/IPSS cytogenetics criteria may be helpful for identification of the high risk patients with the RA group who may benefit from early SCT despite the relatively high incidence of SCT-related complications.",M1
15034234,"Soluble transferrin receptor and its ratio to erythroblasts in bone marrow may be a new diagnostic tool to distinguish between aplastic and refractory anemia.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), especially refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) are very heterogeneous diseases regarding their morphological, biological and clinical features. One important clinical problem is the difficulty of diagnosis. Soluble transferrin receptors (sTfRs) reflect the erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow (BM). To establish whether determination of serum sTfR could be useful for the differential diagnosis between RA and aplastic anemia (AA), we measured the serum sTfR concentrations, BM cellularity and BM erythroblast percentages in 14 untreated AA and 7 untreated RA patients. The serum sTfR levels of the RA patients (820.1 +/- 402.8 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those of the AA patients (491.1 +/- 195.2 ng/ml; p = 0.0207). However, the serum sTfR values of RA and AA patients also overlapped. A new index, the 'sTfR-E index' [the ratio of serum sTfR level (ng/ml) to BM cellularity (%) x BM erythroblasts (%)] is proposed, which is expected to reflect the number of transferrin receptors (TfR) on the cell membrane per BM erythroblast. The sTfR-E index values of the 7 RA patients (0.395 +/- 0.234) were significantly lower than those of the 14 AA patients (2.669 +/- 1.633; p = 0.0003). The sTfR-E index values of AA and RA patients overlapped only marginally. In conclusion, the sTfR-E index may be a useful new diagnostic tool to distinguish between AA and RA patients.",M1
14738441,"Protein 4.1 deficiency and deletion of chromosome 20q are associated with acquired elliptocytosis in myelodysplastic syndrome.We report a case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), associated with prominent elliptocytosis. A 66-year-old male presented with peripheral pancytopenia, and was diagnosed with MDS [refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>)]. Apart from marked elliptocytosis, dyshaematopoietic features were not evident in his peripheral blood or hypercellular bone marrow. After 18 months, he had progressed to RA with excess blasts in transformation. Analysis of red blood cell membrane proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed a reduced quantity of protein 4.1 (30% of control). Deletion of chromosome 20q was identified by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Marked elliptocytosis, persistent for more than 17 months, decreased strikingly after chemotherapy with idarubicin and Ara-C. These findings suggest that acquired elliptocytosis occurred as an unusual morphological feature of MDS, associated with abnormalities of protein 4.1 and chromosome 20q.",M1
14632779,"Outcome following haematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplasia and del (5q) karyotypes.The deletion (5q) karyotype [del (5q)] in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is considered a good risk feature, while the impact of del (5q) combined with other karyotypic abnormalities [del (5q)+] is less well defined. We analysed the outcome of haematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) in patients with MDS with del (5q) or del (5q)+. Fifty-seven patients, aged 6-72 years, with MDS and del (5q) abnormalities received HCT from related (n = 32) or unrelated (n = 25) donors. By French-American-British (FAB) criteria, 27 patients had refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>), 10 RA with excess blasts (RAEB), eight RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) and 12 acute myeloid leukaemia evolving from MDS (tAML). Non-relapse mortality at 1-year post-transplantation was 30% for del (5q) and 38% for del (5q)+ patients. Relapse occurred in one of 20 del (5q) patients and 15 of 37 del (5q)+ patients (P = 0.001). After adjusting for del (5q) status, blast count (&lt;5%) was the only factor significantly associated with relapse-free survival. Patients with del (5q), either as a '5q- syndrome' or with MDS in general, had better outcomes than did patients with del (5q)+. The indication for transplantation in patients with del (5q) was generally severe cytopenias, compared with disease progression to a more advanced FAB stage in patients with del (5q)+. Conceivably, outcome for patients with del (5q)+ would be improved with transplantation earlier in the disease course.",M1
14604279,"High expression of YB-1 gene in erythroid cells in patients with refractory anemia.It has been shown that aberrant expression of a transcription factor, GATA-1, leads to maturation arrest and transformation of erythroid cells. We previously reported that a multifunctional protein, YB-1, was expressed strongly in the spleen of a GATA-1 mutant mouse, which was filled with transformed erythroblasts. This finding suggested that YB-1 has roles in erythropoiesis. In this study, we examined in vivo expression of YB-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in bone marrow erythroid cells and erythroid leukemic cell lines. During erythroid differentiation of erythroid leukemic cell lines, the expression level of YB-1 mRNA was highest at the early phase of differentiation and then decreased. In human bone marrow cells, the in vivo expression level of YB-1 mRNA was higher in glycophorin A-positive cells than in glycophorin A-negative cells. An interesting finding was that expression of YB-1 was higher in erythroblasts in myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>) than in normal cells. The findings suggested that YB-1 functions in the early stage of erythropoiesis and that aberrant expression of this protein may induce hematological diseases such as MDS.",M1
12804635,"Cyclosporin A therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome: multicenter pilot studies in Japan.We examined the efficacy of cyclosporin A (CsA) in 50 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) consisting from 47 of <e>RA</e>, 1 of RARS, and 2 of RAEB. These patients showed various marrow cell types including hypo-, normo-, and hypercellularity. Patients belonged to the following International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups: 4 of low, 41 of intermediate-1, and 5 of intermediate-2. The median CsA dose was 4.58mg/kg, and treatment responses were classified according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Hematological improvement (HI) was observed in 30 (60%) patients, and all of them were belonged to RA. In the patients with RARS or RAEB, no efficacy was observed. Four (8%) of the responders achieved partial remission (PR) with granulocytes &gt; or = 1500microl(-1), Hb&gt;11g/dl and platelets &gt; or = 100,000microl(-1). Higher response rate (53%) was shown in erythroid lineage (HI-E) compared to platelet (HI-P, 36%) or neutrophil lineage (HI-N, 35%). When we analyzed the correlation between the response to CsA therapy and the karyotype or HLA type, there were significantly more responders with good karyotype or DRB1*1501 than with intermediate/poor karyotypes or with other HLA types. These results indicate the usefulness of CsA therapy for MDS patients with any marrow cellularity, especially for erythroid lineage and patients with good karyotype or DRB1*1501.",M1

In this paper, the diagnosis and treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis complicated in 3 cases of hematological malignancy (2 acute leukemias and 1 MDS-<e>RA</e>) were retrospectively analysed. All patients had histories of hypoimmunity and were received prophylactic antifungal treatment. Pulmonary aspergillosis infection still occurred and confirmedly diagnosed by sputum examination. After 7 to 14 days of combination treatment of liposomal amphotericin B, itraconazole and flucytosine, 2 cases were cured and another showed effective.

12681357,"Expression of TNF receptors and related signaling molecules in the bone marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias despite hypercellularity of the bone marrow regarded as the result of ineffective hematopoiesis mainly caused by apoptosis. In this study, we examined the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis in the bone marrow cells of MDS patients. The constitutive expression of mRNA for TNF receptors (TNFR), including TNFRI and TNFRII, and the adapter molecules, such as the TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), receptor interacting protein (RIP) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) were analyzed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in bone marrow samples from control, MDS and AML cases. In bone marrow cells from refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) patients, there was a significant increase in TNFRI expression as compared with control subjects. The expression of TNFRII was also up-regulated in RA cases. In contrast, RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) and AML cases revealed increased expression of TNFRII, whereas the expression of TNFRI was comparable to control subjects. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the TNFRI, as well as TNFRII of MDS bone marrow was expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells, but not in macrophage-lineage stromal cells at the protein level. An increased constitutive expression of mRNA for TRADD, FADD and RIP and decreased expression of mRNA for TRAF-2 were observed in bone marrow cells from MDS patients, especially from RA patients, as compared with controls, although the differences were not significant. In many of the AML bone marrow samples, strong expression of TRAF-2 mRNA was marked, while expression levels of other proteins were similar to those in control subjects. These data suggested enhanced signaling by the TNFRI-TRADD-FADD pathway and suppressed signaling by the TRAF-2 pathway in RA. Thus, TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis may play a role in ineffective hematopoiesis in  early stage MDS  bone marrow, although the regulatory mechanisms for TNF-alpha-induced signaling would be complicated and not be simply explained only by these pathways.",M1

In total, 20 patients were evaluable at the study end-point (response to treatment at 6 months). The diagnosis in these 20 patients was refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>) in 13, RA with excess blasts in four, and RA with ringed sideroblasts in three. Median age was 54.5 years (range, 31-73 years). There were two cases of secondary MDS. The bone marrow was hypocellular in eight cases and cytogenetics were abnormal in four cases. All patients received lymphoglobuline (horse ATG; Sangstat, France) at a dose of 1.5 vials/10 kg/day for 5 d. The treatment was well tolerated. Three patients in the study died (disease progression, invasive aspergillosis and lung carcinoma respectively); 10 out of 20 evaluable patients (50%) responded to treatment and became transfusion independent; eight out of 13 (62%) patients with RA responded. The median duration of response was 15.5 months (2-42+ months) at the time of analysis.",M1
12543079,"Effect of azacytidine in the release of leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin m, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-11 by mononuclear cells of patients with refractory anemia.5-azacytidine (AZA) yields hematologic improvement in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Ineffective hemopoiesis in MDS produce the paradox of high intramedullary cellularity with peripheral cytopenias. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-11 regulate hemopoiesis and LIF, OSM, and IL-6 also inhibit the proliferation of myeloid leukemic cell lines through the signal-transducing subunit gp130. These IL-6-type cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell culture supernatants (SN) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) and monocyte-depleted MNC of patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>; n=12) and healthy individuals (n=10). AZA down-regulated OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 release by MNC of patients but not by MNC from healthy individuals. Patient's SN had significantly lower concentrations of LIF, OSM, and IL-11 than SN of normal subjects. When monocyte-depleted MNC of patients were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin a significant increment in OSM levels was observed. In contrast, monocyte depletion in healthy subjects did not cause any significant change in OSM values. We conclude that: (a) AZA inhibits the release of OSM, IL-6, and IL-11 exclusively in RA-diseased MNC, (b) Patient's MNC release subnormal amounts of LIF, OSM, and IL-11, and (c) RA-derived monocytes probably down-regulate OSM release by phytohemagglutinin-activated MNC.",M1
12537974,"A prognostic impact of separation of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and 5q- syndrome from refractory anemia in primary myelodysplastic syndrome.A prognostic impact of WHO classification of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was studied in a group of 103 primary MDS patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) according to French-American-British (FAB) classification. Median survival of 37 patients with RA according to WHO criteria of 85.2 months was significantly different from that in both 37 patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) (47.0 months, P=0.002) and 29 patients with 5q- abnormality diagnosed by routine chromosome banding (36.2 months, P=0.0002). A more detailed karyotype analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques confirmed 5q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality in only 12 out of 29 patients, in 4 patients 5q- was associated with complex abnormalities involving 5q region, 13 patients had 5q deletion combined with further karyotype abberations outside 5q. No difference in median survival and estimated 3 years survival was observed between RA patients, patients with 5q- syndrome according to WHO morphology criteria and patients with 5q- as a single abnormality confirmed by FISH in contrast to patients with either additional 5q abberations or further karyotype changes not involving 5q. The same difference was also observed in time to 25% of patients evolving to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our study confirmed usefulness of separation of RCMD from RA. RCMD represents a poor prognostic subgroup of MDS clearly distinct from pure RA mainly due to short survival connected with progressive bone marrow failure and increased risk of leukemic transformation. We also suggest to define 5q- syndrome as primary MDS of FAB type RA with 5q deletion as a sole cytogenetic abnormality confirmed by FISH analysis. This definition enabled us to discriminate 5q- patients with favorable prognosis similar as in RA from those with poor outcome associated with 5q- combined with complex abnormalities involving either 5q or regions outside 5q.",M1
12482502,"Autologous lymphocytes inhibit hemopoiesis in long-term culture in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.OBJECTIVE: The current therapy of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is unsatisfactory and comprises mainly supportive treatment or antileukemic chemotherapy. Recent studies about successful immunosuppressive therapy suggest an autoimmune mechanism in subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) from 15 patients with low-grade MDS, refractory anemia, and refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (<e>RA</e> and RARS), and from 7 normal donors were depleted of CD2(+), CD5(+), and CD7(+) lymphocytes using magnetic cell sorting. Depleted and nondepleted MNC were seeded onto irradiated allogeneic bone marrow stroma and the generation of colony-forming-cells (CFC), the clonal origin of hemopoietic progenitor cells in long-term bone marrow culture (LTC), was compared. RESULTS: The capacity of MNC from 7 healthy donors to generate hemopoiesis remained unchanged in the lymphocyte-depleted LTC. In contrast, cultures initiated with lymphocyte-depleted MNC from patients with RA and RARS exhibited a significantly increased generation of CFC compared with the corresponding nondepleted cultures. Microsatellite analysis in 6 patients revealed that a significantly increased number of CFC grown in lymphocyte-depleted LTC showed no allelic loss, suggesting an outgrowth of normal hemopoietic cells. CONCLUSION: These results provide a rationale for the recently described successful treatment of MDS with immunosuppressive therapy. We suggest that in certain subtypes of MDS the residual normal hemopoiesis is suppressed by autoimmune mechanisms, eventually allowing the expansion of the abnormal clone.",M1
12469185,"Expression of the anti-apoptotic gene survivin in myelodysplastic syndrome.Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAPs) family and considered to play a pivotal role in oncogenesis. We present the first report of survivin expression profile in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Expression of survivin messenger RNA was evaluated by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in patients with MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Eleven out of 12 patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) (91.6%), and all 3 patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBt) (100%), were positive for survivin expression with the majority of cases showing abundant levels of the survivin transcript. On the other hand, expression of survivin was undetectable in the 4 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). The level and frequency of survivin expression in patients with refractory anemia were compared to those in patients with AML. Out of 12 patients with de novo AML, 5 patients (41.7%) showed detectable levels of survivin expression. Abundant survivin expression in RA was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, survivin was almost absent in two cases with aplastic anemia. We propose that high levels of survivin expression can serve as a reliable diagnostic marker of RA in MDS.",M1
12416735,"Long-term follow-up of patients with aplastic anemia and refractory anemia responding to combination therapy with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin.In our previous study, approximately 60% of aplastic anemia (AA) and refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) patients treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) showed a multilineage response. In this study, we analyzed the long-term follow-up of the multilineage responders (multi-R). In the follow-up analysis of 11 multi-R (6 AA and 5 RA), 10 patients (5 AA and 5 RA) were evaluable. The range of time from the start of treatment to the final contact was 50 to 125 months. Analysis of survival times revealed a significant difference between multi-R and non-multi-R among AA patients given this treatment (P = .016). One AA and 1 RA patient among the multi-R developed acute leukemia. Of 7 living multi-R, 3 AA and 2 RA patients did not need transfusion at final contact. Four of them maintained the target hemoglobin concentration of more than 11 g/dL for quality-of-life benefit. The findings suggested that this result is an important advantage of this treatment.",M1
12411290,"Antithymocyte globulin has limited efficacy and substantial toxicity in unselected anemic patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has recently been popularized as an effective treatment in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We treated 8 anemic MDS patients (refractory anemia [<e>RA</e>] and refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB-1]) with ATG (40 mg/kg/d for 4 days) and prednisone in a phase 2 trial. The study was stopped early according to a preset termination rule because of lack of efficacy. There were no salutary responses. Toxicities included serum sickness (in all patients), transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, vomiting, and syncope with a generalized seizure. At least 3 patients had the HLA-DR15 (DR2) allele. We conclude that the risk-benefit ratio of ATG in an unselected population of MDS patients may be unfavorable, and more work is needed to define the subset of patients who will respond to ATG before its widespread use can be recommended.",M1
12406866,"Mitochondrial ferritin expression in erythroid cells from patients with sideroblastic anemia.The sideroblastic anemias are characterized by ring sideroblasts, that is, red cell precursors with mitochondrial iron accumulation. We therefore studied the expression of mitochondrial ferritin (MtF) in these conditions. Erythroid cells from 13 patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and 3 patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) were analyzed for the distribution of cytoplasmic H ferritin (HF) and MtF using immunocytochemical methods. We also studied 11 healthy controls, 5 patients with refractory anemia without ring sideroblasts (<e>RA</e>), and 7 patients with RA with excess of blasts (RAEB). About one fourth of normal immature red cells, mostly proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity for HF, but very few were positive for MtF (0%-10%). Similar patterns were found in anemic patients without ring sideroblasts. In contrast, many erythroblasts from patients with sideroblastic anemia (82%-90% in XLSA and 36%-84% in RARS) were positive for MtF, which regularly appeared as granules ringing the nucleus. Double immunocytochemical staining confirmed the different cellular distribution of HF and MtF. There was a highly significant relationship between the percentage of MtF(+) erythroblasts and that of ring sideroblasts (Spearman R = 0.90; P &lt;.0001). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated the presence of MtF mRNA in circulating reticulocytes of 2 patients with XLSA but not in controls. These findings suggest that most of the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of MtF and that this latter might be a specific marker of sideroblastic anemia.",M1
12404285,"Effects of cyclosporine on hematopoietic and immune functions in patients with hypoplastic myelodysplasia: in vitro and in vivo studies.BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression may benefit some patients with hypoplastic myelodysplasia (HMDS) and refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), but its mechanism of action is still obscure. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we studied Fas-receptor (Fas-R), Fas-ligand (Fas-L), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression in CD34(+) cells and lymphocytes obtained from 11 HMDS and 20 RA patients. In colony assays and long-term cultures, the effects of Fas triggering, IFN-gamma blockade, or cyclosporine(CsA) on the growth of hematopoietic progenitors (colony-forming cells [CFC]) were determined. The effects of CsA at daily doses of 1-3 mg/kg for at least 3 months in HMDS patients were also studied. RESULTS: In basal conditions, committed and immature progenitor cells were found decreased in myelodysplastic (MDS) patients. No significant differences between HMDS and RA patients were detected. IFN-gamma-expressing CD4(+) cells were significantly increased in HMDS patients, whereas intracytoplasmic Fas-L expression was only borderline elevated in CD3(+) MDS cells. Increased numbers of CD34(+) cells expressing Fas-R were found in HMDS and RA patients. CFC and secondary CFC showed higher susceptibility to Fas-L-mediated inhibition and the blockade of IFN-gamma improved marrow primary, but not secondary, CFC growth. CsA added in vitro to patient's lymphocytes significantly decreased the number of IFN-gamma-expressing CD4(+) cells, but not Fas-L production. These effects were associated with increased colony formation. Similar to IFN-gammablockade, production of secondary CFC was not enhanced by CsA. Administration of CsA to patients resulted in prolonged partial hematologic improvement in 8 of 11 HMDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Increased frequency of IFN-gamma producing CD4(+) cells supports the involvement of lymphocyte-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis in the development of cytopenia in MDS patients. The ability of CsA to decrease in vitro IFN-gamma production may improve hematopoietic function, explaining the beneficial effect of this agent in HMDS patients.",M1
12111784,"Expression and prognostic significance of Bcl-2 family proteins in myelodysplastic syndromes.Excessive apoptosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We assessed by flow cytometry the expression of several members of the Bcl-2 family in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of 168 MDS samples at diagnosis. The proteins studied were Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (anti-apoptotic), Bax, Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS (pro-apoptotic). The percentage of BMMNC expressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was higher in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) than in refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RAS). Conversely pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bak, and Bcl-xS were detected in a higher percentage of cells in RA and RAS. RA and RAS were associated with an increased Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio. The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was also correlated with that of CD34 and P170 and with the percentage of blast cells. Two-color analyses demonstrated that CD34 and Bcl-2 were usually expressed in the same cells. No significant correlation was found with cytogenetic abnormalities. Higher expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins (Bak, Bad, Bcl-xS) and higher Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio were associated with longer survival and decreased risk of leukemic transformation in univariate analysis, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was associated with decreased survival. Consequently Bcl-2 proteins expression was well correlated with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Our data confirm that the control of apoptosis is deregulated in MDS cells. Moreover, the study of markers such as CD34 (or Bcl-2), Bcl-xL, and Bcl-xS provides additional prognostic information.",M1
12100145,"Prolonged administration of erythropoietin increases erythroid response rate in myelodysplastic syndromes: a phase II trial in 281 patients.Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) improves anaemia in approximately 20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We investigated the potential advantage of a prolonged administration of rHuEpo to achieve higher erythroid response rates (RR) in 281 MDS patients: 118 with refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>), 77 with refractory anaemia and ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 59 with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts and blast count &lt; 10% (RAEB-I), and 27 with RAEB and blast count between 11-20% (RAEB-II). rHuEpo was given subcutaneously at a dose of 150 U/kg thrice weekly, for a minimum of 26 weeks. Response to treatment was evaluated after 12 and 26 weeks of therapy. The overall RR was 45.1%; the RR for RA, RARS, RAEB-I and RAEB-II were 48.3%, 58.4%, 33.8% and 13% respectively. A significant increase in RR was observed at week 26 in RA, RARS and RAEB-I patients, as the response probability increased with treatment duration. The RR was higher in the good cytogenetic prognostic group and serum Epo level of &gt; 150 U/l at baseline predicted for non-response. The median duration of response was 68 weeks and the overall risk of leukaemic transformation was 21.7%. These results suggest that prolonged administration of rHuEpo produces high and long-lasting erythroid RR in MDS patients with low blast counts, particularly in those with pretreatment serum Epo levels of &lt; 150 U/l and good cytogenetic prognosis.",M1
12068800,"Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels correlate with survival and independently predict response to EPO treatment in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.Treatment with recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) can alleviate anaemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The present study, based on a long-term follow-up of 68 MDS patients (26RA, 16 <e>RAS</e>, 26 RAEB) treated with EPO alone, pinpoints pre-treatment variables associated with response induction, response duration and overall survival. Response, defined as an increase in haemoglobin &gt;15gL1 or eliminated erythrocyte transfusion requirements, was observed in 22 of 66 (33%) evaluable patients. The median response duration was 15 (range 3-64+) months. Using univariate logistic regression models, responders displayed significantly lower baseline serum EPO levels (S-EPO), more often normal bone marrow blast cell content (RA/RAS vs. RAEB), normal cytogenetics and no need for erythrocyte transfusion. In a multiple logistic regression model, S-EPO (P=0.009), marrow blast content (P=0.031) and erythrocyte transfusion need (P=0.024) remained associated with response induction. The probability of response for a patient with S-EPO &gt;50UL1, RA/RAS and no transfusion need was 0.79 (0.53-0.93, 95% CI). The median overall survival time from start of EPO treatment was 26 months, significantly longer for responders than for non-responders (49 vs. 18 months, P=0.018). Survival was also predicted by baseline S-EPO; patients with S-EPO &gt;50UL1 (n=50) had a median survival of 17 months, as compared to 65 months for those with S-EPO &gt;50UL1 (n=14, P=0.024). The international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) for MDS predicted survival (P=0.003) and progression to acute leukemia (P&lt;0.001) but not response to EPO treatment. Furthermore, in a logistic regression model with S-EPO and IPSS, S-EPO (but not IPSS) was again a significant predictor for response (P=0.007). Our data facilitate the optimal selection of MDS patients suitable for EPO treatment and pinpoint S-EPO as a powerful predictor of response and overall survival in MDS.",M1
11999352,"F-blast is a useful marker for differentiating hypocellular refractory anemia from aplastic anemia.Making a morphologic distinction between hypocellular refractory anemia (hypo <e>RA</e>) and aplastic anemia (AA) is difficult. To investigate the significance of hemoglobin F-containing erythroblasts (F-blasts) and p53 expression in making the distinction between hypo RA and acquired AA, we immunohistochemically assessed F-blasts and p53 in bone marrow specimens from 16 patients with hypo RA, 31 patients with acquired AA, and 15 hematologically normal individuals. F-blast production was elevated in 87.5% (14/16) of patients with hypo RA, but in only 3.2% (1/31) of patients with AA (P &lt; .01). p53 was overexpressed in 75.0% (12/16) of hypo RA patients and in 6.4% (2/31) of AA patients (P &lt; .01). The mean contents of F-blasts and p53-positive cells in patients with hypo RA were 6.31% +/- 3.27% and 7.54% +/- 4.36%, respectively, of all bone marrow cells, which were significantly higher than for patients with AA (0.35% +/- 0.46% and 0.58% +/- 1.29%, P &lt; .01). In conclusion, a high prevalence of elevated F-blast production is noted in hypo RA, suggesting that the assessment of F-blasts in bone marrow can be used as an additional tool for differentiating hypo RA from acquired AA.",M1

In the first twin, induction therapy resulted in complete remission (CR). At relapse 9 months later monosomy 7 was found. The patient died of sepsis 11 months after diagnosis. The other twin presented with leucopenia and thrombocytopenia and refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>) was diagnosed. During follow-up, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated a monosomy 7 in 11% of the cells. Twenty-eight months following diagnosis the patient progressed to RA with excess blasts in transformation and induction chemotherapy was initiated without achieving CR. Three months later an allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a niece was performed, resulting in CR of the secondary AML.",M1
11840281,"Elevated plasma level of differentiation inhibitory factor nm23-H1 protein correlates with risk factors for myelodysplastic syndrome.We measured plasma nm23-H1 level (nm23-H1), a differentiation inhibitory factor, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The nm23-H1 in AA was not significantly elevated when compared to normal subjects (6.66 +/- 1.20 ng/ml vs 5.13 +/- 0.81 ng/ml; P = 0.274). In contrast, MDS patients had significantly high levels of nm23-H1 compared not only to normal subjects (11.16 +/- 1.42 vs 5.13 +/- 0.81 ng/ml; P = 0.0004) but also to those of the AA group (11.16 +/- 1.42 ng/ml vs 6.66 +/- 1.20 ng/ml; P = 0.018). In the MDS group of patients, no significant difference was observed in the nm23-H1 levels between patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with excess blasts (RAEB)/RAEB in transformation (10.71 +/- 1.61 ng/ml vs 9.24 +/- 2.66 ng/ml; P = 0.672). Of the patients with RA, patients with low risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) had significantly low levels of nm23-H1 compared to those of IPSS INT-1 level cases (6.40 +/- 1.36 ng/ml vs 13.05 +/- 2.50 ng/ml; P = 0.0028), suggesting that nm23-H1 may be useful as a prognostic marker for MDS, especially in low risk patients.",M1
11840256,"Thalidomide for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.We examined the efficacy of thalidomide in 34 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): five RAEB-T, four RAEB, three CMML, six RARS, and 16 <e>RA</e>. Patients belonged to the following cytogenetic groups: 15 complex abnormal karyotypes, 12 normal karyotypes, four cases with 5q- as sole anomaly and three single aberrations. The median thalidomide dose was 400 mg/day (25/34 patients). Four patients discontinued the study after less than 5 weeks, because of fatigue (three) or skin rash (one). One patient died of heart failure after 4 weeks. In the remaining 29 patients (median follow-up: 13 months), treatment responses were classified according to the IWG criteria. Six patients (four RA, two CMML) showed progressive disease (five with transformation into AML) and four patients showed stable disease. Hematological improvement (HI) was observed in 19 patients. Nine of the responders (three RA, one RARS, two RAEB, three RAEB-T) achieved partial remission with granulocytes &gt; or = 1500/microl, Hb &gt; 11 g/dl and platelets &gt; or =100,000/microl. Four patients (one RARS, one CMML, one RAEB, one RAEB-T) had a major response, with platelet and RBC transfusion independence. Six patients (five RA, one RARS) showed minor responses (three HI-E, two HI-E+HI-P, one HI-E+HI-N). Hematological improvement occurred after a median of 2 months of thalidomide treatment. Two patients (RAEB-T) relapsed after a partial remission lasting 8 and 16 months, respectively. In summary, a therapeutic benefit was achieved in 19 of 34 study patients (56%).",M1
11807630,"Menatetrenone, a vitamin K2 analog, ameliorates cytopenia in patients with refractory anemia of myelodysplastic syndrome.Vitamin K2 induces differentiation of leukemic cell lines and apoptosis of immature blasts in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We recently reported a case of MDS-refractory anemia (MDS-<e>RA</e>) with trilineage hematologic response to oral administration of menatetrenone, a vitamin K2 analog. To determine a possible role of this agent in treatment of MDS-RA, we conducted a prospective randomized trial assessing the safety and efficacy of menatetrenone. A total of 18 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with MDS-RA were randomized to receive either 45 mg of oral menatetrenone (group 1) or no menatetrenone (group 2). Administration of menatetrenone was well tolerated. Of the nine patients in group 1 (56%), five improved with menatetrenone treatment while only one (11%) of the group 2 patients improved. Three patients (33%) showed a major response in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), two (22%) showed a major response in hemoglobin concentration, and two of the nine (22%) showed a major response in platelet count. The ANC of group 1 patients rose after treatment, while that of group 2 patients decreased slightly at follow-up after 16 weeks ( p=0.03). Significant improvement was also seen in final platelet count ( p=0.01), but not in hemoglobin concentration. Given the absence of toxicity, menatetrenone can be recommended for all patients with MDS-RA.",M1
11601200,"[Refractory anemia and preleukemia: an analysis of 92 cases]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between MDS-<e>RA</e> (refractory anemia subtype of myelodysplastic syndromes) and preleukemia (PL). METHODS: Hematological parameters of 86 RA and 6 PL patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-four RA cases (39.53%) transformed into acute leukemia (AL), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t). As compared with 52 non-transformed RA cases, the transformed cases showed the following hematological features: 1. higher frequencies of immature granulocytes (P &lt; 0.005), erythroblasts (P &lt; 0.05) and megaloerythrocytes (P &lt; 0.05), and higher granulocyte nuclear lobulation (P &lt; 0.001) in peripheral blood; 2. higher percentages of early erythroid and granulocytic lineages (P &lt; 0.05), and higher frequencies of erythroblasts with multiple nuclei (P &lt; 0.05), pseudo Pelger-Huet abnormality (P &lt; 0.05), and micromegakaryocytes (P &lt; 0.005) in bone marrow. CONCLUSION: There is a higher overlap between RA and PL; the above hematological features may be useful for predicting the transformation of RA patients. Based on those findings, a score system for predicting the transformation of RA was proposed.",M1
11599186,"[Skin manifestations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes]PURPOSE: Our purpose was to describe cutaneous manifestations associated with myelodysplastic syndromes. METHODS: Data from seven patients with cutaneous vasculitis (four cases), neutrophilic dermatosis (one case), relapsing polychondritis (one case), and possible erythema elevatum diutinum (one case) in association with myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anaemia <e>RA</e>, RA with excess of blasts--RAEB-, RAEB in transformation RAEBt, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia--CMML-), and analysis of the literature were reviewed. RESULTS: The cutaneous manifestations of myelodysplastic syndrome may or may not be specific, and may reveal hemopathy transformation. The cutaneous vasculitis are the most frequent and polymorphic. The relation with neutrophilic dermatosis is more specific; they are a spectrum of diseases including pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, erythema elevatum diutinum (nuclear segmentation anomalies of neutrophils both in the skin and in the blood are a biological marker of the association). Relapsing polychondritis is significantly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes. Their pathogenesis are controversial. CONCLUSION: Early biopsy of cutaneous lesions in myelodysplastic syndromes is indicated. Analysis of blood cell count (and more bone marrow biopsy in relapsing polychondritis) is indispensable in these neutrophilic cutaneous or vasculitis diseases.",M1
11597730,"Increased peripheral stem cell pool in MDS: an indication of disease progression?The colony-forming capacity of the peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells (PBSC) in different forms of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was investigated. In most cases of refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) the colony growth of PBSC was definitely reduced as compared to the controls. However, in RA with unfavorable chromosomal aberrations, in refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) and in advanced stages of MDS such as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and refractory anemia in transformation (RAEB-t), the number of myeloid progenitor cells increased up to 100-fold. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the increase was even more marked, up to 350-fold. Although the number of PBSC was strongly elevated, these cells were not able to restore hematopoiesis in vivo. In conclusion, the increase of circulating colony-forming cells (CFC) seems to be associated with disease progression, and thus, the evaluation of PBSC could be an important parameter in the diagnosis of MDS.",M1
11523410,"[Apoptosis and proliferative activity of bone marrow cells in patients with aplastic syndromes as evidenced by trephine biopsy]AIM: To clarify the effect of cyclosporin A (CSA) on the apoptosis and proliferative activity of bone marrow cells in patients with aplastic syndromes by trepanobiopsy evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TUNEL immunohistochemical assay was used to study apoptosis of bone marrow cells in the histological specimens from 24 patients: 8 with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 8 with acute small-proportion leukemias [RA with excessive blasts (RAEB) + RAEB in transformation (RAEBt)], 3 with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), 5 with lymphogranulomatosis (LGM). Control apoptosis examination was made in 10 patients treated with CSA. The proliferative activity of bone marrow cell was evaluated by bone marrow histological specimens from 10 patients (8 patients with RA and 2 with RAEB + RAEBt) at the onset of disease and during CSA therapy in the immunohistochemical test with primary nuclear antigen Ki-67 antigen antibodies. Changes in the proliferative activity and degree of apoptosis of bone marrow cells were assessed in relation to the cellularity detectable by the histological specimens. RESULTS: Patients with RA showed an increase in bone marrow cell apoptosis to 25.375 +/- 6.874 (-10.8 +/- 5.122 and 8.333 +/- 5.84 in controls and ANLL patients, respectively). The cells of hemopoiesis and stromal microenvironment are in the process of cell death. Higher bone marrow cellularity is observed in CSA-treated patients at clinical and hematological remission, which is followed by rises in the index of proliferation and the degree of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The clinical effect of CSA in patients with aplastic syndromes is induced by its direct or mediated stimulating effect on pluripotent stem cells of hemopoiesis, by increasing bone marrow cellularity at the expense of clonal and/or normal hemopoiesis.",M1

11417482,"Role of splenectomy in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes with peripheral thrombocytopenia: a report on six cases.Thrombocytopenia is generally of central origin in MDS, but can be due to peripheral platelet destruction in some cases. We studied platelet lifespan in 61 MDS cases with platelets &lt; 70,000/mm3 and marrow blasts &lt; 10%. Nine of them (15%) had a major platelet lifespan reduction (&lt; 3.5 days), and were considered for splenectomy. Three of them were not splenectomized due to rapid death, patient refusal and older age plus liver predominance of platelet sequestration, respectively. The remaining six patients (two females and four males, median age 50 years, range 32 to 65) were splenectomized 3 to 21 months after diagnosis. Before splenectomy, five of them had <e>RA</e> and one had CMML. Platelets counts ranged from 5000 to 30,000/mm3 and did not durably respond to other treatments. Three of the patients has a relapse of platelet counts, concomitantly required platelet transfusion due to recurrent blending, whereas three had anemia (two required erythrocyte transfusion) and four had neutropenia. Three months after surgery, platelet counts ranged from 55,000 to 160,000/mm3 (&gt; 100,000/mm3 in four cases), no patient required platelet or erythrocyte transfusion, but there was no effect on neutrophil counts. Three patients had a relapse of platelet counts, concomitant with progression to AML in two of them, whereas the third relapsing case achieved normal platelet counts with further danazol. One patient died with normal platelet counts 12 months after splenectomy (from sepsis, probably related to neutropenia rather than splenectomy). Two patients remained with normal platelet counts 10 and 52 months after surgery. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of thrombocytopenia should be studied more often in 'low risk' MDS (i.e. with low bone marrow blast counts) with thrombocytopenia, as about 15% of them appear to have peripheral platelet destruction. Some of those patients may benefit from splenectomy.",M1
11380604,"Decreased amount of mpl and reduced expression of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and glycoprotein Ib on platelets from patients with refractory anemia: analysis by a non-isotopic quantitative ligand binding assay and immunofluorescence.Using a non-isotopic ligand binding assay and immunofluorescence, we examined the amount of mpl, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (gpIIb/IIIa) and glycoprotein Ib (gpIb) on platelets from healthy volunteers and patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>). For the analysis of mpl expression, we applied both a non-isotopic ligand binding assay and immunofluorescence using anti-mpl monoclonal antibody, and compared the results from both methods. The non-isotopic ligand binding assay has been developed in our laboratory and is suitable for the quantitative analysis of a small amount of cytokine receptors such as mpl on platelets. In platelets from patients with RA, the amount of mpl expressed by the D value was 0.05+/-0.03 (mean+/-standard deviation), and was significantly lower than that in healthy volunteers (0.15+/-0.05, p&lt;0.0001). The mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of gpIIb/IIIa and gpIb on platelets from RA patients were 28.8+/-8.8 and 20.8+/-7.7, respectively, and were significantly lower than those on normal subjects (93.2+/-22.6 and 67.4+/-9.1, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). There was a good correlation between the amount of mpl and the MFI of gpIIb/IIIa (p=0.794, p&lt;0.0001) or gpIb (p=0.774, p&lt;0.0001), and between those of gpIIb/IIIa and gpIb (p=0.728, p&lt;0.0001). We demonstrated a decreased amount of mpl as well as a reduced expression of gpIIb/IIIa and gpIb on platelets from RA patients.",M1

In the past years an intriguing number of applications of amifostine have been identified; one of these is bone marrow cells protection and stimulation. Amifostine was administered in seven patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, four males and 3 females aged between 67 and 78 years old, in order to estimate its efficacy in reducing the need for red blood cells transfusions. Two patients had RAEB, four <e>RA</e> and one RARS. The drug was administered in an outpatient basis in a dose of 300 mgr/m2, three times weekly for at least four weeks. We administered at the same time erythropoietin 10.000 U subcutaneously. All patients received daily supplementation of oral ferrum sulfate and folic acid. Three patients, a woman with RA and two men, one with RA and another with RAEB improved the levels of Hb beyond 12,0 gr/dl and did not receive blood transfusions after the second week of treatment. The drug was well tollerated without any side effects in all of the patients.",M1
11302550,"Relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for refractory anemia is increased by shielding lungs and liver during total body irradiation.Patients with the refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome who undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) have a low risk of relapse, but they have a high risk of nonrelapse mortality when prepared with conventional preparative regimens. To try to reduce nonrelapse mortality, we treated 14 RA patients with a modified approach to total body irradiation (TBI) followed by cyclophosphamide (CY) and HLA-identical sibling BMT. Median patient age was 44 years (range, 28 to 65 years). Patients received TBI with shielding of the right lobe of the liver and both lungs followed by electron beam boosts to shielded ribs. Total radiation exposure in nonshielded areas was 12 Gy (n = 10), 10 Gy (n = 3), or 6 Gy (n = 1). After TBI, patients received CY at 120 mg/kg over 2 days, followed by transplantation of unmanipulated bone marrow. All patients initially achieved engraftment with donor cells, although 2 patients had subsequent reemergence of host hematopoiesis without evidence of disease relapse. Five patients died of transplantation-related causes between 22 and 1262 days post-BMT. Four patients relapsed between 157 and 1096 days post-BMT. These 14 patients were compared with 46 historical controls with RA who received conventional CY/TBI or busulfan/CY preparative regimens. Patients in the experimental group had a similar nonrelapse mortality rate compared with the historical control group (29% versus 37%, respectively; P = .8), but a higher relapse rate (34% versus 2%, P = .0004) and a lower disease-free survival (38% versus 61%, P = .16). We conclude that this modified TBI approach is associated with an unacceptably high risk of relapse for patients with RA undergoing BMT.",M1
11216704,"Hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced numbers of B-cells in children with myelodysplastic syndrome.BACKGROUND: Immunodeficiency in pediatric patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has not been described. We report the clinical course of three children with MDS, hypogammaglobulinemia, and reduced numbers of B-cells and B-cell precursors. OBSERVATIONS: Three patients with recurrent infection who were younger than 1-year-old had MDS of the refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) subtype diagnosed. All had reduced numbers of circulating B-cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. In two patients, cytogenetic studies revealed a monosomy 7 karyotype and bone marrow studies showed decreased numbers of CD34+ progenitor cells and CD 19+ B-cells. Both patients had prolonged courses (7 yrs 10 mos and 6 yrs 9 mos) characterized by recurrent infection and slowly progressive pancytopenia. Both received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The third patient had normal cytogenetic studies and a normal number of CD34+ progenitors but decreased CD19+ B-cells in the bone marrow. She had a stable course with refractory anemia over the course of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with MDS may have hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced numbers of B-cells. These findings do not preclude a relatively stable and prolonged clinical course. Children with newly diagnosed MDS should have an immunologic evaluation in addition to their hematologic assessment.",M1
11168505,"Investigation for the presence of anti-erythropoietin antibodies in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.OBJECTIVES: Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) improves anemia in 25% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The variable and sometimes low response rate to rHuEpo treatment raises the question whether the existence of autoantibodies against erythropoietin (epo) is partially responsible. In the present study we investigated the presence of anti-epo autoantibodies in MDS patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients with MDS were studied. Sixteen patients had refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), 13 had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 3 had RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), 9 had RAEB in transformation and 2 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. They were divided in 3 groups according to rHuEpo treatment. Group A consisted of 10 patients who did not receive rHuEpo treatment. Group B included 13 patients who were on rHuEpo treatment (150 IU/kg subcutaneously, 3 times weekly) showing an increase of hemoglobin (Hb) values or reduction of transfusion requirements and Group C consisted of 20 patients who did not respond or stopped responding to rHuEpo treatment. Laboratory studies consisted of a complete blood cell count, measurement of serum epo and determination of anti-epo antibodies using ELISA. RESULTS: There were no significant differences with regard to age and sex among the three groups. No autoantibodies against epo were found in the examined sera, apart from a female patient from group A who showed a low positive titer. CONCLUSION: We suggest that anti-epo autoantibodies do not contribute to the development of MDS-related anemia and are not responsible for the modest response to rHuEpo treatment. Further investigation is needed to identify possible reasons for the low response rate to rHuEpo treatment.",M1
11167795,"Methylation of the p15(INK4B) gene in myelodysplastic syndrome: it can be detected early at diagnosis or during disease progression and is highly associated with leukaemic transformation.To investigate the time sequence of occurrence of p15(INK4B) gene methylation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its correlation with leukaemic transformation and survival of patients, the methylation status of the p15(INK4B) promoter region was analysed in 50 patients and was serially studied in 22 of them. Of the 50 patients, 17 (34%) showed p15(INK4B) gene methylation, first demonstrated at diagnosis or during follow-up. When FAB subtypes at the time of study were used in the analysis, the incidence of (p15INK4B) methylation in each risk group of MDS remained stable throughout the course: 0% for low-risk MDS [refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>) and RA with ring sideroblasts] and from 23% at diagnosis to 30% for high-risk MDS [RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia] respectively. The incidence of p15(INK4B) methylation rose to 60% at initial study and, finally, to 75% in cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) evolved from MDS. Most patients (69%) with p15(INK4B) methylation showed disease progression to AML; it could be detected before, at the time or after the diagnosis of leukaemic transformation. p15(INK4B) methylation in MDS patients implicated a shorter survival time in univariate analyses, but its prognostic significance disappeared in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, p15(INK4B) methylation can be detected early at the diagnosis of MDS or acquired during disease progression. It may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some high-risk MDS and is related to leukaemic transformation of MDS.",M1
11122148,"Neutrophil-specific reduction in the expression of granulocyte--macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor subunits in myelodysplastic syndromes.The proliferative and differentiative response of neutrophils to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is known to be impaired in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To investigate the mechanisms of the defective response in MDS, we examined expression levels of GM-CSF receptor alpha (GMR alpha) and common beta (beta c) subunits on CD16(+) neutrophils, CD14(+) monocytes and CD3(+) T cells from 26 MDS patients and 10 healthy controls using flow cytometry. Expression of GMR alpha was significantly decreased on the neutrophils of five out of 26 patients and was not specific for any FAB subtype. In contrast, beta c expression on neutrophils was significantly reduced in 14 out of 26 patients with a higher proportion occurring in the advanced stages of MDS including refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) and overt leukaemia compared with refractory anaemia (<e>RA</e>)/RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) or healthy controls. Decreased beta c also correlated with the degree of hypogranular neutrophil morphology and increased infection. Expression of both subunits on T cells and monocytes in MDS was similar to normal controls. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA isolated from the affected neutrophils suggests that the reduction of beta c may result from decreased message levels. The observed reduction in GM-CSF receptor expression could account for the impaired proliferative and maturational responses in MDS.",M1
11086182,"P53 overexpression in bone marrow biopsies in refractory anemia and aplastic anemia: impact of antibody selection.There is a growing interest in studying cell cycle and apoptosis in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). p53 has been a major target of several studies. We examined the impact of antibody selection on p53 overexpression in bone marrow (BM) biopsies of 28 patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) in addition to 10 cases of aplastic anemia (AA) using three antibodies DO-7, PAb 1801, and PAb 240. DO-7 was positive in 68%, PAb 1801 in 18% and PAb240 in 4% of RA patients. All three antibodies were negative in AA. We conclude that antibody selection is an important variable in studying p53 in MDS regardless of the method of fixation or decalcification of BM trephine biopsies.",M1
11039665,"Thrombopoietin and myelodysplastic syndromes.Thrombopoietin (TPO), a major cytokine involved in megakaryocystopoiesis/thrombopoiesis, may be effective for the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We reviewed the available data relating to the therapeutic potential of TPO for MDS and found the following. The endogenous TPO level is elevated in MDS patients, especially in those with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>). In RA patients, but not in patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), both the platelet and megakaryocyte counts correlate inversely with the endogenous TPO level. This scenario indicates that the physiological mechanism for regulating the endogenous TPO level is conserved, at least in part, in RA patients. The number of TPO receptors (TPO-R) expressed on platelets and CD41+ and/or CD34+ cells in MDS is reduced to nearly half the number present in normal subjects. This is consistent with the finding that TPO-induced in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis is not uniformly observed in MDS. Meanwhile, in some patients with RAEB, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, blasts have the TPO-R mRNA and probably TPO-R protein. This fact may explain the lack of correlation between the endogenous TPO level and the platelet and megakaryocyte counts in RAEB and RAEB-t and suggests that TPO may induce blast proliferation in some cases. These findings may be of use when designing a clinical trial of TPO for MDS.",M1
11027834,"Alteration of c-mpl-mediated signal transduction in CD34(+) cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.OBJECTIVE: Megakaryocytic differentiation is frequently defective in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). As underlying mechanisms, deregulated thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl)-mediated signaling pathways have been suggested. This study therefore examined whether the impaired signaling in MDS and AML cells includes alterations of c-mpl itself or postsignaling events. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells from healthy donors, patients with MDS (<e>RA</e>, RAEB-T), and patients with AML after MDS were isolated by MACS. Expression of c-mpl cDNA was studied by RT-PCR. Thrombopoietin dependent activation of STAT proteins and MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Both splicing isoforms of c-mpl (c-mpl-p and c-mpl-k) were expressed in all of the CD34(+) cells examined. Analysis of the c-mpl cDNA revealed no sequence abnormality. We show c-mpl dependent activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 as well as MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) in CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals. Cells derived from RA patients revealed low basal levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 molecules. This phosphorylation was enhanced by stimulation with recombinant thrombopoietin (PEG-rHuMGDF). STAT1 failed to be activated by PEG-rHuMGDF in CD34(+) cells from healthy donors as well as from patients with MDS. In RAEB-T and AML M7 the constitutive expression levels of STAT1, 3, 5, and MAPK were markedly upregulated, resulting in a strong activation of STAT3 and 5 by PEG-rHuMGDF. Despite its high expression, the level of MAPK phosphorylation was not increased in RA or RAEB-T compared to the normal control, and was completely undetectable in AML M7. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the defective megakaryopoiesis in MDS is not caused by a lack of c-mpl and that STAT3 and STAT5 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of the leukemic cells.",M1
10997326,"CD34/QBEND10 immunostaining in bone marrow biopsies: an additional parameter for the diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndromes.CD34/QBEND10 immunostaining has been assessed in 150 bone marrow biopsies (BMB) including 91 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 16 MDS-related AML, 25 reactive BMB, and 18 cases where <e>RA</e> could neither be established nor ruled out. All cases were reviewed and classified according to the clinical and morphological FAB criteria. The percentage of CD34-positive (CD34 +) hematopoietic cells and the number of clusters of CD34+ cells in 10 HPF were determined. In most cases the CD34+ cell count was similar to the blast percentage determined morphologically. In RA, however, not only typical blasts but also less immature hemopoietic cells lying morphologically between blasts and promyelocytes were stained with CD34. The CD34+ cell count and cluster values were significantly higher in RA than in BMB with reactive changes (p&lt;0.0001 for both), in RAEB than in RA (p=0.0006 and p=0.0189, respectively), in RAEBt than in RAEB (p=0.0001 and p=0.0038), and in MDS-AML than in RAEBt (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.0007). Presence of CD34+ cell clusters in RA correlated with increased risk of progression of the disease. We conclude that CD34 immunostaining in BMB is a useful tool for distinguishing RA from other anemias, assessing blast percentage in MDS cases, classifying them according to FAB, and following their evolution.",M1
10911379,"Type I and type II T-cell profiles in aplastic anemia and refractory anemia.Immune-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis has been considered the most important mechanism in the development of idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) and some types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Using flow cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine expression at the single-cell level, we analyzed helper-T (Th) and cytotoxic-T (Tc) subsets in patients with AA and MDS of refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) subtype. The results showed marked increases in the Th1/Th2 ratio and Tc1/Tc2 ratio in both AA and MDS/RA. Overproduction of cytokines inhibitory to hematopoiesis reported so far might be a reflection of imbalanced development of Th and Tc. Determination of the factors that affect Th and Tc profiles may lead to further understanding of immunological states and the development of effective immunotherapy in AA as well as some types of MDS.",M1
10870480,"Effect of treatment with amifostine used as a single agent in patients with refractory anemia on clinical outcome and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha levels.Amifostine increases in vitro burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/granulcoyte-macrophage cultured from bone-marrow cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Several small clinical studies give divergent informations about the potential of amifostine as single agent to improve hematopoiesis in MDS patients. In these studies, patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) were analyzed together, resulting in response rates varying from 8% to 30%. The present multi-center study evaluated whether treatment with amifostine is of clinical benefit in patients with RA who are transfusion dependent. The effect on transfusion frequency as well as on platelets and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was examined in 14 patients with RA [median age 67 years (55-72 years), male:female 9:5]. Four treatment cycles were planned, each consisting of intravenous amifostine at 200 mg/m2/day three times per week followed by a 2-week interval. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a main suppressive cytokine for hematopoiesis in RA patients, serum samples for analyzing endogenous levels of TNF alpha were collected prior to the study and after four treatment cycles. In three patients (21%), reduced transfusion requirement with prolongation of the transfusion interval from 4 weeks to 8 weeks (two patients) and 4 weeks to 6 weeks was seen. An increase in ANC from 400/microliter to 2600/microliter and 200/microliter to 3400/microliter was observed in two patients. Platelets increased from 129,000/microliter to 277,000/microliter in an additional patient. In one patient, disease progression from RA to RAEB was observed. Serum TNF alpha levels were increased in MDS patients compared with normal controls (18.8 pg/ml vs 9.1 pg/ml), and there was no change during the treatment with amifostine (17.5 pg/ml). In conclusion, treatment with amifostine as a single agent was of limited benefit in patients with RA. The serum TNF alpha levels were unchanged during treatment with amifostine in RA patients.",M1

10749583,"Detection of TNFalpha expression in the bone marrow and determination of TNFalpha production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in myelodysplastic syndrome.TNFalpha is a highly active cytokine which plays an important role in the regulation of apoptotic cell death, a mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we investigated the expression of TNFalpha of the bone marrow trephine biopsies by immunohistochemical method and the TNFalpha production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by ELISA method in 15 patients affected by MDS. Five of seven patients without excess of blasts showed high or intermediate TNFalpha expression in the bone marrow biopsies, whereas two patients with excess of blasts were negative and one had low expression. The five CMML patients revealed low or intermediate expression. The production of TNFalpha by the PBMC was analysed in 10 patients, four patients with <e>RA</e> and two with CMML produced higher level of TNFalpha which increased after stimulation with phorbol myristic acetate, but none of the RAEB patients revealed increase in TNFalpha production. In conclusion we suppose that increased TNFalpha expression and production by PBMC may be an indirect evidence of the role of increased apoptosis in low risk MDS patients.",M1
10713334,"Comparative multi-color flow cytometric analysis of cell surface antigens in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors between refractory anemia and aplastic anemia.Refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) without prominent dysplasia closely resemble the mild type of aplastic anemia (AA) in their hematological features. This sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish clearly between the two diseases. Using the multi-color flow cytometric technique, we compared cell surface antigen expression patterns on bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells which were isolated as a CD34 positive- CD45 dull positive with low side scatter intensity (CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low)) population in flow cytogram between RA (n=12) and AA (n=11). The antigens analyzed in CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) mononuclear cells were: CD38 and CD71 for cell growth-related antigens, CD 33 and CD13 for myeloid and monocytoid lineage-associated antigens, CD7 and CD19 for lymphoid lineage, and CD14 for a monocytic lineage specific antigen. The percentages of CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) cells in bone marrow non-erythroid mononuclear cells, and the expression frequencies of CD38, CD71, CD33 and CD13 antigens in CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) progenitors were all significantly decreased in AA compared to normal bone marrows (n=7) (P&lt;0.005). In contrast, in RA bone marrows the percentages of CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) cells showed wide distribution and the cell surface antigen expression patterns varied among each case: some cases showed low frequencies of CD38 and CD71 expression as well as AA, whereas the others showed high expression frequency of specific antigen(s) which may reflect the clonal expansion of an abnormal clone in bone marrow. An MDS patient who had progressed from RA to RAEB showed further projecting pattern of expression of CD38 and CD33 in CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) population in accordance with the disease progression. These data suggest that analysis of cell surface antigen expression patterns of CD34(+)CD45(dull+)SSC(low) progenitor cells by multi-color flow cytometry appears to be a useful method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of marrow progenitor states in AA and RA, therefore this method could be helpful for early detection of clonal evolution in MDS.",M1
10706070,"Establishment of stromal cell line from an MDS <e>RA</e> patient which induced an apoptotic change in hematopoietic and leukemic cells in vitro.OBJECTIVE: We previously reported on the heterogeneity of bone marrow stromal cell function in supporting hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro among refractory anemia (RA) of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Interestingly, stromal cells from some MDS RA patients induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanism responsible for this action was unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we established a cloned stromal cell line (LS801) from an MDS RA patient by introducing recombinant SV40-adenovirus vector containing the SV40 early gene. RESULTS: LS801 induced an apoptotic change in CD34+ cells from normal subjects and cloned leukemic cells in a coculture system. When hematopoietic cells were cocultured but kept separate from LS801 by a 0.45-microm Millipore membrane to prevent their attachment, the action of LS801 in inducing apoptosis of hematopoietic cells was inhibited. Additionally, no production of fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma in LS801 was observed. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the novel stromal cell line LS801 will shed light on research into the mechanism underlying the apoptotic changes induced by stromal cells in hematopoietic cells.",M1
10681719,"Prolonged response to cyclosporin-A in hypoplastic refractory anemia and correlation with in vitro studies.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lymphocyte abnormalities in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been widely described, but the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these clonal disorders remains controversial. An active role of lymphocytes in suppressing normal hematopoiesis may be implicated in MDS with hypoplastic marrow. We have studied in vitro and in vivo activity of cyclosporin-A (CSA) on hematopoiesis in patients affected by hypoplastic MDS without blast excess. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with hypoplastic refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>), followed up in our out-patient unit, were treated with CSA at daily doses of 1-3 mg/kg for at least three months. Low dose steroids or danazol were transiently added in 7/9 patients. Differences between pre- and post-treatment parameters were studied by the Student's t-test. In vitro effect of CSA on circulating hematopoietic progenitors was studied by the methylcellulose colony assay. RESULTS: Before treatment, fewer circulating hematopoietic progenitors were found in all patients as compared to normal subjects. The number of CD34+ cells was about halved, while circulating erythroid and myeloid colony-forming cells (CFC) were reduced to one-fifth. After a mean period of 22 months of CSA treatment (median: 14.5 months), hemoglobin was significantly and persistently increased in two patients, platelets in one, platelets and hemoglobin in two. Two patients showed transient responses, one patient did not tolerate the treatment and one patient is close to a significant response. At in vitro CSA concentrations similar to those achieved in vivo after oral administration the drug significantly increased cell colony growth in hypoplastic RA. This test correctly predicted a positive clinical response to CSA in 3/5 cases and treatment failure in 4/4 cases. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: About one half of hypoplastic RA patients benefited from CSA treatment. A larger study could verify whether in vitro culture of hematopoietic progenitors in the presence of CSA can predict the clinical response and whether this treatment could prolong patients' survival.",M1
10629588,"Two cases of myeloid disorders and a t(8;12) (q12;p13).BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 12 have been described in different hematologic malignancies. Some of these abnormalities showed a rearrangement of the ETV6 gene. We studied the 12p region in one case with a t(8;12)(q12;p13) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). DESIGN AND METHODS: We have identified a chromosome translocation, t(8;12)(q12;p13) in two patients with myeloid disorders; one with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and one with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>). FISH studies with specific probes (cosmids and YACs) for the 12p region were used to investigate one case. RESULTS: FISH studies demonstrated hemizygous loss of the ETV6 and CDKN1B regions and two copies of the CCDN2 locus, as a result of the balanced translocation and an additional copy of the der(8). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid diseases with t(8;12)(q12;p13) have an interstitial deletion of 12p, including the ETV6 and CDKN1B regions. A duplication of CCDN2 locus can also be found.",M1
10580565,"Incidence of nucleoli in erythroblasts in patients suffering from refractory anemia of myelodysplastic syndrome.Nucleoli of erythroblasts have been studied in patients suffering from refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in control patients without a disturbed erythropoiesis in order to provide information on the incidence of nucleoli and micronucleoli in these cells. Nucleoli in erythroblasts were visualized by a simple cytochemical procedure for the demonstration of RNA which facilitated the visualization not only large nucleoli but also micronucleoli in advanced stages of the erythroblastic maturation. In control patients nucleoli were detected in all stages of erythroblastic development. In patients suffering from RA of MDS, a relatively large population of polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts was characterized by a loss of nucleoli accompanied by the decreased incidence of micronucleoli characteristic of these cells. In contrast to control patients, in patients suffering from RA of MDS the number of nucleoli expressed by the values of the nucleolar coefficient of erythroblasts was smaller, particularly in both the early and terminal stages of erythroblastic development. Thus in patients with RA of MDS both the abnormal loss of nucleoli and decreased number of nucleoli in erythroblasts apparently represent and reflect a further abnormality of disturbed erythropoiesis.",M1
10557045,"New system for assessing the prognosis of refractory anemia patients.Refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) is a very heterogeneous disease regarding biological and clinical features. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was useful for assessing the prognosis in the whole group of 219 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. However, the IPSS was not sufficient in 132 RA patients. To predict survival and freedom from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution, we investigated individual prognostic factors based on the clinical parameters (age, gender, morphologic features, cytopenias and cytogenetics) of 132 RA patients using univariate and multivariate analyses. Based on the results, we devised a new system for assessing the prognosis of RA patients. In our system, RA patients with pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomalies &gt;/=3% were classified as high risk (12 patients); of patients without pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomalies &gt;/=3%, those with intermediate/poor karyotype according to IPSS, Hb &lt;/=6 g/dl or mMgk &gt;/=10% were classified as intermediate risk (57 patients); and those without high or intermediate risk were classified as low risk (67 patients).

10359063,"Megakaryocytic growth in patients with refractory anemia is suppressed by treatment with interferon alpha.IFN alpha alone or in combination with retinoids or haematopoietic growth factors has been used to treat patients with early MDS because of its properties as a differentiation inducing agent. We investigated whether treatment of patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) with IFN alpha (1.5x10(6) IU twice a week) and intermittent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 25 mg/m2/d) influences in-vitro megakaryocytic (MK) proliferation and differentiation stimulated by PEG-rHuMGDF. Low-density non-adherent bone marrow (BM) cells from 8 patients with RA were assayed prior to any treatment other than supportive and after a period of 6 months of treatment. MK development was assayed in suspension cultures in the presence of PEG-rHuMGDF and SCF for 7 d using morphological criteria and flow cytometric analysis of CD42b (GP1b) positive cells. BM-cells from 10 healthy individuals served as control. Following stimulation with PEG-rHuMGDF 23+/-7% and 16+/-4% of control cells were CD42b positive after 5 and 7 d of cultures, respectively. In cultures of cells from MDS patients prior to treatment 8+/-2% and 7+/-3% of cells were CD42b+ on days 5 and 7. In the course of IFN alpha treatment cultures of all BM samples from these MDS patients revealed a significant reduction of MK precursor cells (3+/-2%, CD42b+, p=0.03 and 0.04). In conclusion, treatment with TFN alpha and ATRA did not result in improved megakaryocytopoiesis as assessed by in-vitro cultures. On the contrary, low-dose IFN alpha appears to suppress cell proliferation as well as MK development.",M1
10214861,"Endogenous FLT-3 ligand serum levels are associated with disease stage in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) caused by a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder progress to either overt leukemia or cytopenia, which leads to lethal infection or bleeding. Although several clinical trials have attempted to reverse cytopenia by using hematopoietic growth factors (HGF), success has been limited due in part to a limited understanding of the role of HGF in MDS progression. The FLT3 ligand, which binds to and activates the FLT3 receptor, does not have a stimulatory effect on hematopoietic cells, but can synergize with other HGF to support the expansion of both immature and committed progenitors. Using ELISA technology we measured endogenous serum levels in 93 patients with MDS: 29 <e>RA</e>, 1 RARS, 31 RAEB, 23 RAEBt, 9 CMML. 48.3% of RA patients' sera had significantly elevated FLT3 ligand levels ranging from 404 to 5735 pg/ml, whereas none of the RAEB, RAEBt, or CMML patients sera had levels different from controls. No significant correlation was found between FLT3 ligand levels and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, age, cytogenetic abnormalities, or survival. Our data suggest that FLT3 ligand levels can be upregulated early in the course of MDS, which may represent an appropriate response to a decreased number of normal progenitors, or alternatively a dysregulated HGF system.",M1
10211754,"Treatment of patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes using a combination of all-trans retinoic acid, interferon alpha, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.Used as single agents, ATRA, G-CSF, and IFN-alpha have shown a moderate benefit in patients with low-risk MDS, with a response rate of 10%. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of these agents. The effect on hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC), as well as on transfusion frequency, was examined in 25 patients with MDS (11 <e>RA</e>, four RARS, eight RAEB, two CMML). The median age was 61 years (range 44-81), and the male/female ratio was 14/11. Treatment consisted of ATRA at 25 mg/m2/day p.o. for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, IFN-alpha at 1.5 MIU twice a week s.c. for 52 weeks, and, in patients with initial ANC &lt;500/microl, G-CSF at 100-480 microg daily s.c. according to the degree of ANC. The duration of therapy was scheduled for 12 months. Two patients achieved ongoing CR (+19 months; +16 months), one patient with RA after 3 months and one with CMML after 7 months of treatment. In all patients, the mean ANC increased significantly from 1400+/-200/microl before the start of therapy to 3500+/-600/microl at the end of treatment (p=0.025). In two patients an increase of Hb was observed, and one patient ceased to require transfusions. In an additional patient with RA and 5q-syndrome, the platelet count normalized following administration of ATRA/IFN-alpha, increasing from 89,000/microl to 293,000/microl. The eight RAEB patients were nonresponders. We conclude that therapy with ATRA, IFNalpha, and G-CSF is effective in approximately 35% of low-risk MDS patients (in this study: six of 17) and may induce complete remission in individual cases.",M1
10071075,"Bone marrow stroma from refractory anemia of myelodysplastic syndrome is defective in its ability to support normal CD34-positive cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro.We examined the supportive function of stromal cells from patients with refractory anemia (<e>RA</e>) of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) on CD34-positive hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation using a long-term bone marrow culture (LTMC) system. Primary marrow stromal cells were obtained from 11 MDS RA patients and 12 healthy volunteers, and freshly prepared CD34-positive bone marrow cells from a normal subject were inoculated onto the stroma. There seems to be three broad patterns of hematopoietic cell growth in the LTMCs. In one group, hematopoietic cells were maintained at near normal levels (type A). In the second group, the number of hematopoietic cells increased within the first 5-10 days of culture, but declined to low levels at 15-20 days of culture as compared with normal control (type B). In the third group, the incidence of hematopoietic cells steadily declined from the beginning of the culture (type C). Furthermore, apoptotic change of hematopoietic cells was very frequently observed in cultures with the type C stroma, which were especially defective for supporting CD34 + cell proliferation and differentiation. The expression of CD95 on hematopoietic cells was induced by the type C stroma, however, production of fas ligand by the stromal cells was not observed. These findings suggest a lack of hematopoietic supportive function in some cases of MDS RA and also indicate that there is heterogeneity of stromal function among MDS RA patients.",M1

Morphological, cytochemical, immunocytochemical, and cytogenetic studies may provide tools for discriminating between both entities. In addition, differences in the pattern of proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow cells in AA and in the myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported. Because of the correlation between p53 and apoptosis, we examined the overexpression of p53 on bone marrow biopsies in RA and AA. Our study included 14 patients with hypo RA, 14 patients with hypercellular (hyper) RA, ten patients with classic acquired AA, and 37 hematologically normal individuals. p53 was overexpressed in eight (57%) hypo RA patients and 11 (79%) hyper RA patients. All normal individuals and patients with AA showed no overexpression of p53 in their marrow. These results were statistically significant:p &lt; 0.01 (AA vs hypo RA), p&lt;0.001 (AA vs hyper RA), while the difference between hypo RA and hyper RA was not statistically significant.

METHODS: A cohort of 848 newly diagnosed patients with rheumatoid arthritis was followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Walking disability and several disease-related and demographic factors were recorded during follow-up. A logistic regression model was used to study associations between walking disability and these factors at different time points. A multilevel logistic regression model for longitudinal data was used to predict walking disability during follow-up from potential predictors at year 2. RESULTS: Global pain and disease activity were consistently related to walking disability at almost every time point. Significant predictors of future walking disability were: walking disability, knee pain, global pain, the passage of time during follow-up, and age. CONCLUSION: Global pain and disease activity are related to walking disability during the first 8 years of <e>RA</e>. Walking disability, knee pain, and global pain at 2 years follow-up predict walking disability later in the disease. In addition, the risk for walking disability increases during the disease process and with higher age at diagnosis.",M2

METHODS: In 4 regions in The Netherlands, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients In Training exercise program was implemented on a limited scale. Evaluation using the RE-AIM model included: Reach, the proportion of the target population participating; Efficacy, effects on muscle strength, aerobic capacity, functional ability, and psychological functioning; Adoption, program adoption by stakeholders; Implementation, intervention quality (quality audits); and Maintenance, stakeholders' willingness to continue the program in the future. RESULTS: Twenty-five physical therapists from 14 practices were trained to provide the program. In total, 150 RA patients were recruited (by estimation, 2% of the target population). Of the 81 patients who had finished the 12-month intervention and were available for followup directly after the intervention, 62 patients provided clinical data. Muscle strength improved significantly, whereas aerobic capacity, functional ability, psychological functioning, and disease activity did not change. All 9 informed local patient organizations facilitated patient recruitment, and 35 of 51 rheumatologists involved referred one or more patients. All 10 approached health insurance companies funded the program for 12 months. The quality audits showed sufficient quality in 9 of 12 practices. All of the providers of the program were willing to provide the program in the future, whereas future reimbursement by health insurance companies remained unclear.

DAS28 scores stratified by level of discordance were compared using a paired t-test. RESULTS: Positive discordance was found in 30% of cases, with a mean +/- SD difference of 46 +/- 15. The strongest independent predictor of discordance was a 5-point increase in PHQ-9 score (adjusted odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.02-2.55). Higher swollen joint count and Cantonese/Mandarin language were associated with lower odds of discordance. DAS28 scores were most divergent among subjects with discordance. CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of RA patients differed from their physicians to a meaningful degree in assessment of global disease severity. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with discordance. Further investigation of the relationships between mood, disease activity, and discordance may guide interventions to improve care for adults with RA.",M2
20535796,"Disease severity and domain-specific arthritis self-efficacy: relationships to pain and functioning in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To examine the degree to which disease severity and domains of self-efficacy (pain, function, and other symptoms) explain pain and functioning in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients. METHODS: Patients (n = 263) completed the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 to assess pain and functioning (physical, affective, and social), the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale to assess 3 self-efficacy domains (pain, physical function, and other). Disease severity was assessed with C-reactive protein level, physician's rating, and abnormal joint count. Structural equation modeling was used to examine 3 hypotheses: does disease severity have a direct relationship with pain and each area of functioning, does disease severity have a direct relationship with each arthritis self-efficacy domain, and do the self-efficacy domains mediate the relationship between disease severity and RA pain and each area of functioning. RESULTS: Disease severity was related to pain, physical functioning, and each self-efficacy domain (beta = 0.28-0.56, P &lt; 0.001). Each self-efficacy domain was related to its respective domain of functioning (e.g., self-efficacy for pain was related to pain; beta = 0.36-0.54, P &lt; 0.001). Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between disease severity and pain and functioning (beta = 0.12-0.19, P &lt; 0.001). Self-efficacy for pain control and to perform functional tasks accounted for 32-42% of disease severity's total effect on their respective outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy for pain control accounted for 32% of disease severity's total effect on pain). Variance accounted for by the total model was 52% for pain, 53% for physical functioning, and 44% for affective and social functioning. CONCLUSION: Disease severity and self-efficacy both impact RA functioning, and intervening in these areas may lead to better outcomes.",M2
20535795,"Factors that influence rheumatologists' decisions to escalate care in rheumatoid arthritis: results from a choice-based conjoint analysis.OBJECTIVE: In order to improve adherence to treatment guidelines and performance indicators advocating tight control of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), it is important to gain insight into the factors influencing rheumatologists' decisions whether or not to escalate care. Our objective was to determine the influence of specific attributes relative to a validated measure of disease activity (the Disease Activity Score [DAS]) on rheumatologists' decisions to escalate care. METHODS: We used a computer-based choice-based conjoint analysis survey to determine the relative importance of 6 attributes on rheumatologists' decisions related to escalation of care in RA. We administered the survey in a convenience sample of rheumatologists attending the 2008 American College of Rheumatology Annual Scientific Meeting. Utilities were calculated using hierarchical Bayes modeling, and these results were used to calculate the relative importance of each attribute. RESULTS: Rheumatologists assigned the most importance to the DAS score (relative importance of 30.7%) in their decision to escalate care. The age of the patient (21.5%) and erosions (20.5%) were rated as equally important in this decision. The decision to escalate care was least influenced by change in symptoms reported by the patient (11.1%), current treatment (8.9%), and disease duration (7.4%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rheumatologists endorse the DAS as a means to guide decision making in RA. We also found that age and erosions are important influences on rheumatologists' decisions to escalate care in RA. Our results add to the literature supporting age bias in RA and suggest that further research is needed to determine how age affects quality of care in clinical practice.",M2
20535785,"Influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy on cancer incidence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had a prior malignancy: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register.OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy upon the incidence of cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and prior malignancy. METHODS: Using data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, a national prospective observational study established in 2001, we identified 293 patients with a prior malignancy from over 14,000 patients with RA. We compared rates of incident malignancy in 177 anti-TNF-treated patients and 117 patients with active RA treated with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), all with prior malignancy. One patient switched therapy and contributed to both cohorts. RESULTS: The rates of incident malignancy were 25.3 events/1,000 person-years in the anti-TNF cohort and 38.3/1,000 person-years in the DMARD cohort, generating an age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.23-1.43) for the anti-TNF-treated cohort compared with the DMARD cohort. Of the patients with prior melanomas, 3 (18%) of 17 in the anti-TNF cohort developed an incident malignancy, compared with 0 of 10 in the DMARD cohort. CONCLUSION: The way in which UK rheumatologists are selecting patients with RA and prior malignancy to receive anti-TNF therapy is not leading to an increased risk of incident malignancy. Although reassuring, these results should not be interpreted as indicating that it is safe to treat all RA patients with prior malignancy with anti-TNF therapy.",M2
20412708,"Rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis-associated cutaneous ulcers.OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of treatment with rituximab in refractory rheumatoid vasculitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: Retrospective study of four female patients with histologically proven RA associated vasculitic cutaneous ulcers. All patients developed the lesions on long term treatment with methotrexate or leflunomide, and three of them with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) blockers. All patients were refractory to prednisolone in the dosage between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body weight for at least 4 weeks prior to rituximab. Rituximab were administered in two intravenous applications in the interval of 14 days accompanied by continued treatment with methotrexate or leflunomide and prednisolone. RESULTS: Three out of four patients achieved a rapid clinical remission of the lesions within 4 to 6 weeks after rituximab therapy continuing at least for four months with a successful corticoid reduction till prednisolone 10 mg a day. One patient showed no remission of the skin lesions accompanied by increasing levels for ESR and CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab treatment seems to be very effective in several cases of vasculitis-associated cutaneous ulcers in RA patients. However, the effectiveness of rituximab in cases with this indication remains to be shown in larger number of patients.",M2
20412703,"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus and endonasal activity in Wegener s granulomatosis as compared to rheumatoid arthritis and chronic Rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.OBJECTIVES: Nasal colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has been implicated in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) disease activity. In this study, the frequency of nasal colonisation with S. aureus in WG was compared to healthy and disease control groups for the first time. Moreover, endonasal activity was correlated to colonisation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nasal carriage of S. aureus of a well-defined group of 89 patients with WG was compared to 40 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRS), 35 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), 50 hospital staff members and 25 subjects without regular hospital contact and correlation analysis of nasal carriage and endonasal activity of WG was performed. RESULTS: WG patients showed significantly higher rates (72%) of nasal colonisation with S. aureus compared to CRS patients (28%) and healthy subjects without regular hospital contact (25%, 95%-CI), but not to RA patients (46%) and hospital staff members (58%). WG patients with nasal carriage of S. aureus had significantly higher endoscopically proven endonasal activity (p=0.01), significantly more often first manifestation of WG in the upper respiratory tract (p=0.02) and higher relapse-rates (p=0.052) than WG patients without such carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Endonasal activity in WG is associated with higher nasal S. aureus colonisation rates and subsequent higher relapse rates. The higher frequency of S. aureus colonisation could be a consequence of a recently shown mucosal barrier defect in WG and facilitate chronic inflammation and granuloma formation in the upper respiratory tract.",M2

20495063,"Analysis of complex biomarkers for human immune-mediated disorders based on cytokine responsiveness of peripheral blood cells.The advent of improved biomarkers promises to enhance the clinical care for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and other immune-mediated disorders. We have developed an innovative approach to broadly assess the cytokine responsiveness of human PBMCs using a multistimulant panel and multiplexed immunoassays. The objective of this study was to demonstrate this concept by determining whether cytokine profiles could discriminate RA patients according to disease stage (early versus late) or severity. A 10-cytokine profile, consisting of IL-12, CCL4, TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-10 release in response to stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, CXCL8 and IL-6 in response to CMV and EBV lysate, and IL-17A, GM-CSF, and CCL2 in response to human heat shock protein 60, easily discriminated the early RA group from controls. These data were used to create an immune response score, which performed well in distinguishing the early RA patients from controls and also correlated with several markers of disease severity among the patients with late RA. In contrast, the same 10-cytokine profile assessed in serum was far less effective in discriminating the groups. Thus, our approach lays the foundation for the development of immunologic  signatures  that could be useful in predicting disease course and monitoring the outcomes of therapy among patients with immune-mediated diseases.",M2
20491377,"[The assesment of diastolic function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis]INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune chronic disease. In comparison with the overall population, mortality and morbidity of RA patients are increased due to cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that autoimmunity mechanisms are included in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Isolated disorder of diastolic function can, even with normal heart contractility, lead to heart failure. The aim of this study was to assess diastolic function in RA patients and determine factors causing diastolic dysfunction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 88 patients with RA treated at Rheumatology Department, Clinical Hospital Centre, Zemun. All the patients were thoroughly examined (clinical findings, laboratory and echocardiographic examination). All parameters of diastolic function (mitral and pulmonary flow) were measured. RESULTS: In RA patients 98.9% had diastolic function disorder. This parameter had been changed prior to clinical signs of heart failure and decrease of ejection fraction. Indicators of diastolic function, velocities E, A and their ratio V(E)/V(A), as well as velocities S, D and their ratio V(S)/V(D) were lower in patients with positive rheumatoid factor. The patients' age (p &lt; 0.01), duration of the disease (p &lt; 0.05), high level of cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05), triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05) and arterial hypertension (p &lt; 0.05) were significant factors considerably affecting diastolic function. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest subclinical myocardial disorder in a great number of RA patients. Apart from early and aggressive treatment of the chronic inflammatory process, it is also necessary to prevent further heart complications by timely recognition and treatment of  standard  risk factors fbr cardiovascular diseases.",M2

METHODS: 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were included in our study. Anti-CCP IgM, IgA and IgG and rheumatoid factor (RF) were detected using ELISA. Blood samples were collected from patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis according to (ACR) criteria in Al Mwasaa University Hospital and Al Assad University Hospital, Damascus, Syria, from December 2007 to December 2008. RESULTS: The sensitivity of anti-CCP IgG was 71.9% and specificity was 100%, Whereas the sensitivity of anti-CCP IgM was 70.3% and specificity was 64%, the sensitivity of anti-CCP IgA was 43.75% and specificity was 100%, RF IgM showed a sensitivity of 70.3% and a specificity of 96%, and anti-CCP IgG prevalence in patients with negative RF was 31.6%. All tests showed no correlation with gender in <e>RA</e> patients.

20461786,"Patient perspective of measuring treatment efficacy: the rheumatoid arthritis patient priorities for pharmacologic interventions outcomes.OBJECTIVE: Collaboration with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) highlights that outcomes important to them include fatigue, coping, and life enjoyment. However, these are not commonly measured in clinical trials. There is little evidence about which outcomes patients would prioritize, or what factors influence patients' prioritization. Our objective was to develop a complementary core set with patients to promote inclusion of their priority outcomes in pharmacologic interventions. METHODS: Nominal groups were conducted with RA patients to rank 63 outcomes generated from previous in-depth interviews. A multicenter postal survey provided the final selection of core outcomes for the Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient Priorities for Pharmacologic Interventions (RAPP-PI), in which RA patients rated the importance of the priority outcomes from the nominal groups and ranked the top 6. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients participated in 5 nominal group discussions and reduced the 63 initial outcomes to the 32 most important. A total of 254 participants in the survey ranked priority treatment outcomes to form the RAPP-PI: pain, activities of daily living, joint damage, mobility, life enjoyment, independence, fatigue, and valued activities. The 8 priorities represent 3 domains of treatment outcomes: direct impact of RA, psychosocial well-being, and function/participation. Chi-square tests showed that disease severity, disease duration, sex, and patients' perceptions of managing, self-efficacy, and normality influenced the selection of priority treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: Collaboration with patients has captured their perspectives of priority outcomes from pharmacologic interventions. Although there is some overlap with professional core outcomes, the additional use of this complementary set will give a broader evaluation of effectiveness of interventions from the key stakeholders: patients.",M2
20461785,"What outcomes from pharmacologic treatments are important to people with rheumatoid arthritis? Creating the basis of a patient core set.OBJECTIVE: Function, patient global assessment, and pain are routinely measured in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) clinical trials. However, other patient-reported outcomes identified as important to patients in qualitative studies, such as fatigue and quality of life, are commonly not included, and modern treatment regimens may have changed patients' expectations of treatment outcomes. Our objective was to elicit patient priority treatment outcomes for pharmacologic interventions since the common use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, which will form the basis of a core set of patient priorities to complement existing professional core sets. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 23 RA patients, purposively sampled for age, sex, medication (anti-TNF or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), disease severity, and work status. Grounded theory guided iterative data collection and analysis. Coding of the data was peer reviewed. A patient research partner collaborated in the research design and analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-three different outcomes important to patients were generated from the interviews. Four major categories of patient outcomes from pharmacologic treatments were developed:  RA under control,   Doing things,   Emotional health,  and  Coping with illness.  The core category (or overall theme) was  Minimizing the personal impact of RA.  CONCLUSION: Although the routine outcomes of pain, function, and overall well-being were raised by the patients, they also generated a further 60 important outcomes that they look for from treatment. This difference in perspective may potentially influence treatment decisions. The next step is therefore to use these data to develop a patient core set.",M2
20461784,"Radiographic severity of rheumatoid arthritis in African Americans: results from a multicenter observational study.OBJECTIVE: To describe radiographic changes in African Americans with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluations of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) Registry, a multicenter observational study. METHODS: Self-declared African American patients were enrolled in CLEAR I, a longitudinal cohort of early RA (disease duration of &lt;2 years) from 2000 to 2005, or in CLEAR II, a cross-sectional cohort (any disease duration) from 2006 to the present. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and sets of hand/wrist and foot radiographs were scored using the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scoring system. RESULTS: A total of 357 and 418 patients were enrolled in CLEAR I and CLEAR II, respectively. We report here an interim analysis of radiographic severity in these patients. For the CLEAR I cohort, 294 patients had a mean radiographic score of 2.89 at the baseline visit; 32.0% showed either erosions (25.9%) or joint space narrowing (JSN; 19.4%). At the 36-month visit, the mean score was 5.65; 44.2% had erosions, 41.5% had JSN, and 54.4% had either. Among those patients without radiographic damage at baseline, 18.9% had progressed at the 36-month visit, compared with 57.1% of those with baseline damage (P &lt; 0.0001). For the CLEAR II cohort, of 167 patients with RA of any duration, 65.3% exhibited joint erosions, 65.3% exhibited JSN, and 74.8% exhibited either. The mean radiographic score was 33.42. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest radiographic study of African American RA patients. Damage occurs early in the disease and is associated with radiographic progression at 3 years of disease duration. The CLEAR Registry will provide a valuable resource for future analyses of genetic, clinical, and environmental factors associated with radiographic severity of RA in African Americans.",M2
20448288,"Current evidence for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with glucocorticoids: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.Glucocorticoids (GCs) rapidly reduce disease activity in early and advanced rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). This systematic review on behalf of the task force on recommendations for the management of RA addresses the efficacy of GCs in RA. A literature search was performed in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, and the ACR/EULAR abstracts 2007 and 2008 on a set of questions relating to the use of GCs in RA. Eleven publications (including three Cochrane reviews comprising 33 trials) that met the criteria for detailed assessment were found. Robust evidence that GCs are effective as bridging therapy was obtained. The addition of GCs, to either standard synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) monotherapy or combinations of synthetic DMARDs, yields clinical benefits and inhibition of radiographic progression that may extend over many years. In early RA, the addition of low-dose GCs (&lt;7.5 mg/day) to DMARDs leads to a reduction in radiographic progression; in longstanding RA, GCs (up to 15 mg/day) improve disease activity. There is some evidence that appropriate timing of GC administration may result in less morning stiffness. Only indirect information was found on the best tapering strategy, supporting the general view that GCs should be tapered slowly in order to avoid clinical relapses. GCs are effective in relieving signs and symptoms and inhibiting radiographic progression, either as monotherapy or in combination with synthetic DMARD monotherapy or combination therapy.",M2
20448287,"Rapid reduction in tenosynovitis of the wrist and fingers evaluated by MRI in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after treatment with etanercept.OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of etanercept in reducing tenosynovitis evaluated by MRI of the hand (h-MRI) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) refractory to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) after 6 weeks of treatment. METHODS: 31 patients with active RA defined by a disease activity score (DAS28) &gt;3.2 and synovitis in the hands were randomised into two groups: 19 patients received 50 mg weekly subcutaneous etanercept added to previous DMARD treatment and 12 patients continued with previous DMARD therapy. Clinical evaluation, blood tests, functional capacity evaluation and h-MRI were performed at the start of the investigation and at week 6. Tenosynovitis was evaluated on T1-weighted sequences with fat suppression after gadolinium as the presence of a peritendinous signal enhancement on axial images using a new method including wrist and finger tendons. The reliability, sensitivity to change and responsiveness of this method were also evaluated. RESULTS: Scores for tenosynovitis showed a significant reduction in the etanercept group compared with placebo (p=0.01) after 6 weeks of treatment. Adding MRI joint synovitis to tenosynovitis scores gave an even higher significant reduction in the etanercept group (p=0.007). A positive and statistically significant correlation between tenosynovitis and DAS28, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein was found, but not with functional capacity. Responsiveness for tenosynovitis was small but was higher when joint synovitis scores were added. CONCLUSION: Addition of etanercept significantly reduced MRI tenosynovitis of the wrist and fingers in patients with active RA refractory to DMARD treatment. The method of scoring tenosynovitis showed good reliability and moderate responsiveness.",M2
20448280,"Current evidence for a strategic approach to the management of rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic literature review of effective strategies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: As part of a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Task Force investigation, a literature search was carried out from January 1962 until February 2009 in PubMed/Ovid Embase/Cochrane and EULAR/American College of Rheumatism (ACR)) abstracts (2007/2008) for studies with a treatment strategy adjusted to target a predefined outcome. Articles were systematically reviewed and clinical outcome, physical function and structural damage were compared between intensive and less intensive strategies. The results were evaluated by an expert panel to consolidate evidence on treatment strategies in RA. RESULTS: The search identified two different kinds of treatment strategies: strategies in which the reason for treatment adjustment differed between the study arms ('steering strategies', n=13) and strategies in which all trial arms used the same clinical outcome to adjust treatment with different pharmacological treatments ('medication strategies', n=7). Both intensive steering strategies and intensive medication strategies resulted in better outcome than less intensive strategies in patients with early active RA. CONCLUSION: Intensive steering strategies and intensive medication strategies produce a better clinical outcome, improved physical function and less structural damage than conventional steering or treatment. Proof in favour of any steering method is lacking and the best medication sequence is still not known.",M2

METHODS: Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles on infliximab (IFX), etanercept (ETN), adalimumab (ADA), certolizumab-pegol (CZP), golimumab (GLM), anakinra (ANA), abatacept (ABT), rituximab (RTX) and tocilizumab (TCZ) published between 1962 and February 2009; published abstracts from the 2007-2008 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR conference were obtained. RESULTS: 87 articles and 40 abstracts were identified. In methotrexate (MTX) naïve patients, biological therapy with IFX, ETN, ADA, GLM or ABT has been shown to improve clinical outcomes (level of evidence 1B). In MTX/other synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) failures all nine biological agents confer benefit (1B), with lower efficacy noted for ANA. RTX, ABT, TCZ and GLM demonstrate efficacy in tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) failures (1B). Less evidence exists for switching between IFX, ETN and ADA (3B). Biological and MTX combination therapy is more efficacious than a biological agent alone (1B). A safety review shows no increased malignancy risk compared with conventional DMARDs (3B). TNFi are generally associated with an increased risk of serious bacterial infection, particularly within the first 6 months of treatment initiation; increased tuberculosis (TB) rates with TNFi are highest with the monoclonal antibodies (3B). CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence for the efficacy of biological agents in patients with RA. Safety data confirm an increased risk of bacterial infection and TB with TNFi compared with conventional DMARDs.",M2
20447954,"Current evidence for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>)-a first step in a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) initiative to produce recommendations for the management of RA. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library was performed up to January 2009. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the efficacy of synthetic DMARDs (vs placebo or other synthetic DMARDs) on signs and symptoms, disability and/or radiographic structural damage in patients with RA were selected. Studies of biological agents or glucocorticoids were excluded. A pooled effect size (ES) was calculated by meta-analysis. Safety and the occurrence of infections and neoplasia was also assessed. RESULTS: 97 RCTs (14 159 patients) were analysed for efficacy. The pooled analysis indicated that methotrexate (MTX) was more efficacious in reducing signs and symptoms, disability and radiographic structural damage than other synthetic DMARDs pooled: ES for swollen joint count (SJC) versus pooled DMARDs=1.42 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.18). Leflunomide appeared to be as effective as MTX. Sulfasalazine and injectable gold were efficacious in reducing signs and symptoms and structural damage. Ciclosporin, minocycline, tacrolimus and hydroxychloroquine showed some efficacy in reducing SJC. Auranofin and D-penicillamine showed no significant superiority over placebo. The risks of cancer and of infection were increased with cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: MTX was well-tolerated and effective in reducing signs and symptoms, disability and structural damage. A comparison with other synthetic DMARDs was in favour of MTX, though at the tested doses MTX and leflunomide were equally effective.",M2
20447950,"Economic aspects of treatment options in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To review the cost effectiveness of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) treatments and inform the clinical recommendations by the European League Against Rheumatism. METHODS: A systematic literature search and review of the health economic evidence on RA treatment options was performed. RESULTS: Despite diverse methodological approaches, health economic analyses are concordant: at onset of disease, traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are cost effective-that is, treatment merits outweigh treatment costs. If DMARDs fail, therapeutic escalation with tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNFi) is cost effective when standard dosing schemes are employed. If TNFi fail, rituximab or abatacept is cost effective. Economic evidence for switching TNFi remains sparse. CONCLUSIONS: The costly sequelae of insufficiently controlled RA justify intensive escalations of treatment in this disease. By maintaining function, patients are kept in the work process, reducing indirect costs. Quality of life is improved at an expense commonly accepted for chronic diseases. Effective control of disease activity seems to be a prudent use of societal resources.",M2
20445285,"[Secondary osteoporosis UPDATE. Rheumatoid arthritis and bone damage: trends in treatment]Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovitis and bone damage. The bone manifestation in RA consists of joint destruction and systemic osteoporosis, which are brought about by different mechanisms. During the pathological processes, inflammatory cytokines such as TNF are largely produced from inflamed synovium and cause activation of osteoclasts deviated from bone remodelling cycle, resulting in joint destruction. But by the combinational use of methotrexate and TNF-inhibitors, clinical remission, structural remission and functional remission have become possible for the treatment of RA. Especially TNF-inhibitors remarkably suppress the progression of joint destruction in the vast majority of the patients. On the other side, systemic osteoporosis, mainly caused by menopause and glucocorticoid (GC), is often complicated in RA. However, bisphosphonate is well known to be effective for not only treatment but also prevention of GC-induced osteoporosis. Furthermore, anti-RANKL antibody denosumab possesses a potential to inhibit joint destruction as well as systemic and GC-mediated osteoporosis.",M2
20444755,"Investigation of rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility genes identifies association of AFF3 and CD226 variants with response to anti-tumour necrosis factor treatment.BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy has proved to be highly successful in treating rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), although 30-40% of patients have little or no response. The authors hypothesise that this may be genetically determined. In other complex diseases, susceptibility genes have been shown to influence treatment response. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of markers within confirmed RA susceptibility loci with the response to anti-TNF treatment. METHODS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 11 genetic loci were genotyped in 1012 patients with RA receiving treatment with etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed using the absolute change in 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28) between baseline and 6-month follow-up as the outcome variable, adjusting for confounders. p Values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant and associated markers were genotyped in an additional 322 samples. Analysis was performed in the combined cohort of 1334 subjects with RA treated with anti-TNF. RESULTS: In the combined analysis, SNPs mapping to AFF3 and CD226 had a statistically significant association with the response to anti-TNF treatment under an additive model. The G allele at rs10865035, mapping to AFF3, was associated with an improved response to anti-TNF treatment (coefficient -0.14 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.03), p=0.015). At the CD226 SNP rs763361, the C allele conferred reduced response to treatment (coefficient 0.11 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.22), p=0.048). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AFF3 and CD226, two confirmed RA susceptibility genes, have an additional role in influencing the response to anti-TNF treatment.",M2
20444754,"Influence of anti-TNF therapy on mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register.BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy has been associated with reports of rapid severe progression of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (<e>RA</e>-ILD). However, reports also exist of favourable responses to anti-TNF therapy in patients with ILD. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of anti-TNF therapy on mortality in patients with pre-existing RA-ILD. METHODS: Using data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, a national prospective observational study, 367 patients with pre-existing RA-ILD were identified (299 treated with anti-TNF therapy and 68 treated with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)). RESULTS: 70/299 patients (23%) in the anti-TNF cohort died after a median follow-up of 3.8 years compared with 14/68 (21%) in the DMARD cohort after a median follow-up of 2.1 years. The mortality was 68 deaths/1000 person years (pyrs) (95% CI 53 to 86) in the anti-TNF cohort and 92/1000 pyrs (95% CI 50 to 155) in the DMARD cohort, generating an age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate ratio (aMRR) of 1.26 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.31). After further adjustment for potential confounders, the aMRR fell to 0.81 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.73) for the anti-TNF cohort compared with the DMARD cohort. RA-ILD was the underlying cause of death in 15/70 (21%) and 1/14 (7%) patients in the anti-TNF and DMARD cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality in patients with RA-ILD is not increased following treatment with anti-TNF therapy compared with traditional DMARDs. The proportion of deaths attributable to RA-ILD is higher in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy, although reporting bias may exist.",M2
20444750,"EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) may differ among rheumatologists and currently, clear and consensual international recommendations on RA treatment are not available. In this paper recommendations for the treatment of RA with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GCs) that also account for strategic algorithms and deal with economic aspects, are described. The recommendations are based on evidence from five systematic literature reviews (SLRs) performed for synthetic DMARDs, biological DMARDs, GCs, treatment strategies and economic issues. The SLR-derived evidence was discussed and summarised as an expert opinion in the course of a Delphi-like process. Levels of evidence, strength of recommendations and levels of agreement were derived. Fifteen recommendations were developed covering an area from general aspects such as remission/low disease activity as treatment aim via the preference for methotrexate monotherapy with or without GCs vis-à-vis combination of synthetic DMARDs to the use of biological agents mainly in patients for whom synthetic DMARDs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors had failed. Cost effectiveness of the treatments was additionally examined. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients and other stakeholders about a European consensus on the management of RA with DMARDs and GCs as well as strategies to reach optimal outcomes of RA, based on evidence and expert opinion.",M2
20444268,"Peripheral blood gene expression patterns discriminate among chronic inflammatory diseases and healthy controls and identify novel targets.BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) afflict millions of people worldwide, but their pathogenesis is still not well understood. It is also not well known if distinct changes in gene expression characterize these diseases and if these patterns can discriminate between diseased and control patients and/or stratify the disease. The main focus of our work was the identification of novel markers that overlap among the 3 diseases or discriminate them from each other. METHODS: Diseased (n = 13, n = 15 and n = 12 in IBD, psoriasis and RA respectively) and healthy patients (n = 18) were recruited based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria; peripheral blood samples were collected by clinicians (30 ml) in Venous Blood Vacuum Collection Tubes containing EDTA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. Gene expression data was obtained using TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) containing 96 genes that were selected by an algorithm and the statistical analyses were performed in Prism by using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (P-values &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Here we show that using a panel of 96 disease associated genes and measuring mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood derived mononuclear cells; we could identify disease-specific gene panels that separate each disease from healthy controls. In addition, a panel of five genes such as ADM, AQP9, CXCL2, IL10 and NAMPT discriminates between all samples from patients with chronic inflammation and healthy controls. We also found genes that stratify the diseases and separate different subtypes or different states of prognosis in each condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings and the identification of five universal markers of chronic inflammation suggest that these diseases have a common background in pathomechanism, but still can be separated by peripheral blood gene expression. Importantly, the identified genes can be associated with overlapping biological processes including changed inflammatory response. Gene panels based on such markers can play a major role in the development of personalized medicine, in monitoring disease progression and can lead to the identification of new potential drug targets in chronic inflammation.",M2
20439295,"Continued inhibition of structural damage over 2 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate.BACKGROUND: Rituximab inhibited structural damage at 1 year in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) who had had a previous inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To assess structural damage progression through 2 years. METHODS: Intention-to-treat patients with one post-baseline radiograph (rituximab n=281; placebo n=187) received background methotrexate (MTX) and were randomised to rituximab (2 x 1000 mg infusions, 2 weeks apart) or placebo; patients were eligible for rituximab re-treatment every 6 months. By week 104, 82% of the placebo population had received &gt; or = 1 dose of rituximab. Radiographic end points included the change in total Sharp score (TSS), erosion and joint space narrowing scores at week 104. RESULTS: At week 104, significantly lower changes in TSS (1.14 vs 2.81; p&lt;0.0001), erosion score (0.72 vs 1.80; p&lt;0.0001) and joint space narrowing scores (0.42 vs 1.00; p&lt;0.0009) were observed with rituximab plus MTX vs placebo plus MTX. Within the rituximab group, 87% who had no progression of joint damage at 1 year remained non-progressive at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab plus MTX demonstrated significant and sustained effects on joint damage progression in patients with RA and a previously inadequate response to TNF inhibitors.",M2
20439289,"The ACPA isotype profile reflects long-term radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) is a powerful predictive factor for the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). The ACPA response has been shown to consist of various isotypes, but the consequences of differences in isotype distribution have not been extensively investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between ACPA isotypes, disease progression and radiological outcome. METHODS: ACPA isotypes were determined in sera of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2-positive patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To investigate whether the ACPA response continues to evolve during disease development, the ACPA isotype profile during progression of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) to RA was studied. The association of disease progression with ACPA isotype use was assessed using long-term radiographic follow-up data from patients with RA in two independent cohorts. RESULTS: The ACPA isotype distribution did not expand during disease progression from UA to RA, but was relatively stable over time. In both RA cohorts, the baseline ACPA isotype profile was a significant predictor of disease severity, with more isotypes indicating a higher risk of radiographic damage (odds ratio for every additional isotype: 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.9) p&lt;0.001). ACPA isotypes supplied additional prognostic information to ACPA status alone, even after correction for other predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the ACPA isotype profile at baseline reflects the risk of future radiographic damage. These results indicate that the presence and the constitution of the ACPA response are relevant to the disease course of RA.",M2
20436082,"Hydroxychloroquine and glycemia in women with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between current hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use and 2 indicators of glycemic control, fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, in nondiabetic women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: Nondiabetic women with SLE (n = 149) or RA (n = 177) recruited between 2000 and 2005 for a cross-sectional evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors were characterized by HCQ usage status. Unadjusted and multivariately adjusted mean fasting glucose, median insulin, and insulin resistance [assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) calculation] were compared among HCQ users and nonusers for disease-specific groups. RESULTS: More women with SLE were taking HCQ than those with RA (48% vs 18%; p &lt; 0.0001; mean dose ~ 400 mg vs ~ 200 mg). For women with SLE or RA, after adjustment for age, waist circumference, disease duration, prednisone dosage, C-reactive protein, menopausal status, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and disease-specific indicators, serum glucose was lower in HCQ users than in nonusers (SLE: 85.9 vs 89.3 mg/dl, p = 0.04; RA: 82.5 vs 86.6 mg/dl, p = 0.05). In women with SLE, HCQ use also was associated with lower (log)HOMA-IR (0.97 vs 1.12, p = 0.09); in those with RA, no differences in (log)HOMA-IR were seen. HCQ usage was not associated with fasting insulin levels in either patient group. CONCLUSION: HCQ use was associated with lower fasting glucose in women with SLE or RA and also lower (log)HOMA-IR in the SLE group. The use of HCQ may be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk by improving glycemic control in these patients.",M2
20436079,"Uncoupling of collagen II metabolism in newly diagnosed, untreated rheumatoid arthritis is linked to inflammation and antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between markers of collagen II synthesis and degradation with disease activity measures, autoantibodies, and radiographic outcomes in a 4-year protocol on patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) who are naïve to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. METHODS: One hundred sixty patients with newly diagnosed, untreated RA entered the Cyclosporine, Methotrexate, Steroid in RA (CIMESTRA) trial. Disease activity and radiograph status were measured at baseline and 4 years. The N-terminal propeptide of collagen IIA (PIIANP) and the cross-linked C-telopeptide of collagen II (CTX-II) were quantified at baseline by ELISA. PIIANP was also assayed at 2 and 4 years. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) was recorded at baseline. An uncoupling index for cartilage collagen metabolism was calculated from PIIANP and CTX-II measurements. RESULTS: PIIANP was low at diagnosis and 4 years on (p &lt; 0.001), irrespective of treatment and disease activity. PIIANP was lowest in anti-CCP positive patients (p = 0.006), and there was a negative correlation between PIIANP and anti-CCP titers (rho = -0.25, p 0.002). CTX-II was increased (p &lt; 0.001) and correlated positively with disease activity and radiographic progression, but not with anti-CCP (p = 0.93). The uncoupling index was not superior to CTX-II in predicting radiographic changes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cartilage collagen formation and degradation are unbalanced when RA is diagnosed. The different associations of collagen II anabolism (PIIANP) and collagen II degradation (CTX-II) with anti-CCP, synovitis, and radiographic progression indicate that at this early stage of RA, cartilage collagen degradation is mainly driven by synovitis, while anti-CCP antibodies may interfere with cartilage regeneration by inhibiting collagen IIA formation.

20436077,"Clinical significance of serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-2 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical significance of serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: The subjects were 70 patients with RA. Serum VEGF, Ang-1, and Ang-2 levels were determined by ELISA. As indices of disease activity, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-3 were examined, and the 28-joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-CRP was calculated. Power Doppler ultrasonography was performed in the bilateral wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees and ankles. The synovial blood flow signals were scored using a 3-grade scale (0-2), and the total of the scores in the 10 joints was regarded as the total signal score (TSS). RESULTS: Serum VEGF level showed significant correlations with serum CRP and MMP-3 levels, DAS28-CRP, and TSS. Serum Ang-1 level showed significant correlations with serum MMP-3 level and DAS28-CRP. Serum Ang-2 level showed significant correlations with serum CRP level and TSS. CONCLUSION: The serum VEGF level is important as an index of the activity of RA based on angiogenesis and a prognostic factor regarding joint destruction. Serum Ang-1 level may be useful as an index of sustained arthritis based on the maintenance of newly formed vessels. Serum Ang-2 level may reflect a state of marked angiogenesis.",M2
20436075,"Golimumab for rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review.OBJECTIVE: To perform a Cochrane systematic review of benefit (American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria; ACR50) and safety (adverse events and withdrawals) of golimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OVID Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Science Citation Index (Web of Science), and Current Controlled Trials databases for randomized or controlled clinical trials of golimumab compared to placebo or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug in adults with RA. Two authors independently selected appropriate studies and abstracted study characteristics and safety and efficacy data and performed risk-of-bias assessment. We calculated mean differences for continuous measures, and relative risks for categorical measures. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials with 1231 golimumab-treated and 483 placebo-treated patients were included. Of these, 436 were treated with golimumab at 50 mg every 4 weeks [a dosage approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]. At an average of 4-6 months, compared to patients treated with placebo and methotrexate (MTX), patients treated with the FDA-approved dosage of golimumab and MTX were 2.6 times more likely to reach ACR50 (p = 0.005, 95% CI 1.3, 4.9; absolute percentage, 38% vs 15%) and 0.5 times as likely to have overall withdrawals (p = 0.005, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8; absolute percentage, 5% vs 10%). Golimumab-treated patients were significantly more likely than those taking placebo to achieve remission (22% vs 4%; p &lt; 0.00001), and to have improvement in functional ability on the Health Assessment questionnaire [0.2 points lower (p &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI 0.25, 0.15); absolute risk difference, -20% (95% CI -25% to -15%); relative percentage difference, -11% (95% CI -14% to -8.3%)]. The studies were too small and short to be powered sufficiently for safety outcomes, but no substantive statistically significant differences were noted between golimumab and placebo regarding adverse events, serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, lung infections, tuberculosis, cancer, withdrawals due to adverse events, and withdrawals due to inefficacy and deaths. CONCLUSION: At the approved dosage, in patients with active RA taking background MTX, golimumab is significantly more beneficial than placebo. The short-term safety profile is reasonable. Longterm surveillance studies are needed for safety assessment.",M2
20436074,"Antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis are associated with anticitrullinated protein antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and their relatives.OBJECTIVE: Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are relatively specific for rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), and predate disease. The oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may play a role in breaking immune tolerance to citrullinated antigens. We studied a cohort of patients with RA and their relatives looking for associations between anti-P. gingivalis antibodies and ACPA. METHODS: Patients with RA (n = 82) and their relatives (n = 205) from a North American Native (NAN) population were studied, along with 47 NAN and 60 non-NAN controls. IgM and IgA rheumatoid factor (RF) were tested by nephelometry and ELISA. Second-generation anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP2) isotypes and IgG anti-P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides were tested by ELISA. HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by sequencing. Oral hygiene and smoking habits were assessed by questionnaires. RESULTS: Autoantibody frequency in patients with RA and relatives: ACPA 91% vs 19%, respectively; IgM RF 82% vs 17%; IgA RF 48% vs 22%. Anti-P. gingivalis levels were higher in patients with RA compared to relatives and controls (p = 0.005) and higher in ACPA-positive patients with RA than in ACPA-negative patients with RA (p = 0.04) and relatives (p &lt; 0.001), but comparable in RF-positive and RF-negative patients and relatives. Poor oral hygiene and smoking were prevalent, but with no clear association with autoantibodies. Relatives with 2 shared-epitope alleles were more likely to be ACPA-positive (OR 2.5, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In a genetically predisposed population of NAN patients with RA and their relatives, anti-P. gingivalis antibodies were associated with ACPA. These findings suggest that immune responses to P. gingivalis may be involved in breaking immune tolerance to citrullinated antigens.",M2
20435930,"Acute serum amyloid A induces migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation in synovial cells in vitro and in a human rheumatoid arthritis/SCID mouse chimera model.Serum amyloid A (A-SAA), an acute-phase protein with cytokine-like properties, is expressed at sites of inflammation. This study investigated the effects of A-SAA on chemokine-regulated migration and angiogenesis using rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) cells and whole-tissue explants in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. A-SAA levels were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA. IL-8 and MCP-1 expression was examined in RA synovial fibroblasts, human microvascular endothelial cells, and RA synovial explants by ELISA. Neutrophil transendothelial cell migration, cell adhesion, invasion, and migration were examined using transwell leukocyte/monocyte migration assays, invasion assays, and adhesion assays with or without anti-MCP-1/anti-IL-8. NF-kappaB was examined using a specific inhibitor and Western blotting. An RA synovial/SCID mouse chimera model was used to examine the effects of A-SAA on cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis in vivo. High expression of A-SAA was demonstrated in RA patients (p &lt; 0.05). A-SAA induced chemokine expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05). Blockade with anti-scavenger receptor class B member 1 and lipoxin A4 (A-SAA receptors) significantly reduced chemokine expression in RA synovial tissue explants (p &lt; 0.05). A-SAA induced cell invasion, neutrophil-transendothelial cell migration, monocyte migration, and adhesion (all p &lt; 0.05), effects that were blocked by anti-IL-8 or anti-MCP-1. A-SAA-induced chemokine expression was mediated through NF-kappaB in RA explants (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, in the RA synovial/SCID mouse chimera model, we demonstrated for the first time in vivo that A-SAA directly induces monocyte migration from the murine circulation into RA synovial grafts, synovial cell proliferation, and angiogenesis (p &lt; 0.05). A-SAA promotes cell migrational mechanisms and angiogenesis critical to RA pathogenesis.",M2
20435928,"Expanded CD23(+)/CD21(hi) B cells in inflamed lymph nodes are associated with the onset of inflammatory-erosive arthritis in TNF-transgenic mice and are targets of anti-CD20 therapy.Anti-CD20 B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) is very effective for some patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>); however the pathogenic role of B lymphocytes in RA and the primary targets of BCDT are unknown. The human TNF transgenic (hTNF-Tg) mouse model of RA displays a chronic, progressive disease that spreads from distal to proximal joints and is generally considered to be adaptive immune system independent. We have previously reported that knee arthritis in hTNF-Tg mice is accompanied by structural and functional changes of the adjoining popliteal lymph node (PLN), detectable by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. To better understand these changes, in this paper we show that onset of knee synovitis and focal erosions are paralleled by PLN contraction and accumulation of large numbers of B cells in the lymphatic sinus spaces within the node. Flow cytometry from TNF-Tg mice 2, 4-5, and 8-12 mo old demonstrated that B cell accumulation in the PLN follows ankle arthritis, but commences before knee disease, and involves early expansion of CD21(hi), CD23(+), IgM(hi), CD1d(+), activation marker-negative, polyclonal B cells that are found to be specifically restricted to lymph nodes draining inflamed, arthritic joints. The same B cell population also accumulates in PLNs of K/BxN mice with autoantigen-dependent arthritis. Strikingly, we show that BCDT ameliorates hTNF-Tg disease and clears follicular and CD21(hi), CD23(+) B cells from the PLNs. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model whereby B cells contribute to arthritis in mice, and possibly RA, by directly affecting the structure, composition, and function of joint-draining lymph nodes.",M2
20432974,"[A case of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis aggravated during treatment with etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis]A 81-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) was admitted to our hospital because of a productive cough and bloody sputum. She had been treated with etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, for 9 months before admission. A chest CT scan on admission showed small nodules, bronchiectasis and consolidations in bilateral lung fields. A diagnosis of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM) was established by positive cultures for Micobacterium intracellulare both in her sputum and bronchial secretions obtained by bronchoscopy. It has been reported that bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB) and pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) occur during treatment with etanercept or infliximab. However, there were few reports of NTM in post-marketing surveys of etanercept or infliximab in Japan. As pulmonary is NTM related to treatment with etanercept or infliximab and may progress rapidly with few drugs effective against NTM, we should be aware of pulmonary NTM as well as TB and PCP in the treatment of RA with etanercept or infliximab.",M2

20423341,"A novel antagonist of the prostaglandin E(2) EP(4) receptor inhibits Th1 differentiation and Th17 expansion and is orally active in arthritis models.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is an autoimmune disorder involving subsets of activated T cells, in particular T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells, which infiltrate and damage tissues and induce inflammation. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) enhances the Th17 response, exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and promotes inflammatory pain. The current study investigated whether selective antagonism of the PGE(2) EP(4) receptor would suppress Th1/Th17 cell development and inflammatory arthritis in animal models of RA. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Effects of PGE(2) and a novel EP(4) receptor antagonist ER-819762 on Th1 differentiation, interleukin-23 (IL-23) production by dendritic cells (DCs), and Th17 development were assessed in vitro. The effect of ER-819762 was evaluated in CIA and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI)-induced arthritis models. In addition, the effects of ER-819762 on pain were evaluated in a model of chronic inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the rat. KEY RESULTS: Stimulation of the EP(4) receptor enhanced Th1 differentiation via phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signalling, selectively promoted Th17 cell expansion, and induced IL-23 secretion by activated DCs, effects suppressed by ER-819762 or anti-PGE(2) antibody. Oral administration of ER-19762 suppressed Th1 and Th17 cytokine production, suppressed disease in collagen- and GPI-induced arthritis in mice, and suppressed CFA-induced inflammatory pain in rats. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: PGE(2) stimulates EP(4) receptors to promote Th1 differentiation and Th17 expansion and is critically involved in development of arthritis in two animal models. Selective suppression of EP(4) receptor signalling may have therapeutic value in RA both by modifying inflammatory arthritis and by relieving pain.",M2
20422909,"Cardiac autonomic dysfunction in patients with systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and sudden death risk.INTRODUCTION: The manifestations of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in autoimmune diseases have been the subject of many studies. However, the published results pertaining to such research are controversial. Sudden cardiac death due to fatal arrhythmias is frequent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). OBJECTIVE: To analyse risk predictors of sudden cardiac death related to the degree of autonomic dysfunction. METHODS: We performed cardiovascular ANS assessment in 90 patients in this case-controlled study, including 52 (6 male, 46 female) patients with SLE, 38 (6 male, 32 female) with RA and 41 (23 male, 17 female) healthy subjects. The methodology included a comprehensive ECG analysis (with Schiller software AT-10) of QTc interval, late potentials, short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and nonlinear HRV (Poincare plot) analysis; 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring with ECG QTc interval analysis, HRV analysis; 24-hour blood pressure monitoring with systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability; cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (according to Ewing). Vagal dysfunction was established by performing 3 tests: Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing test and heart rate response to standing test. Dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system was examined by applying 2 tests: blood pressure response to standing and handgrip test. RESULTS: In all cardiovascular reflex tests, the frequencies of abnormal results were significantly higher among the patients than among the healthy subjects. Severe autonomic dysfunction was more common in RA. QTc interval was more prolonged in patients with SLE. Both diseases were associated with depressed heart rate variability compared to controls, the reduction being greater in RA patients. In the patients with SLE, autonomic dysfunction is predominantly with higher sympathetic activity while in RA vagal predominance is evident. CONCLUSION: SLE and RA are associated with severe autonomic dysfunction and the presence of significant risk predictors related to the onset of sudden cardiac death.",M2

Spielberger test for situational and personal anxiety and Beck test for depression were used to detect and assess changes in the patients' psychological condition. Comparative studies demonstrated advantages of incorporation of SEMRT in combined RA and OA treatment. Wide spectrum of SEMRT therapeutic actions accounts for its beneficial action in patients presenting with anxiety and depressive disorders associated with inflammatory and dystrophic joint diseases highly refractory to routine treatment.",M2
20408459,"[Rheumatoid arthritis, methothrexate, and pulmonary fibrosis: which evidences?]Pulmonary fibrosis is an extraarticular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), which appears between 20 to 40% of cases. MTX is an ordinary treatment used for patients with RA. It has been suggested in some studies that a link between the use of MTX and the appearance of pulmonary fibrosis exists. Furthermore, the chronic use of MTX has been associated with the development of hepatic cirrhosis. Adenosine, a key molecule in the anti-inflammatory action of MTX seems to have a pro-fibrotic effect in some experimental models, thereby suggesting a mechanism through which MTX could lead to a fibrotic process. However, in spite of these experimental models, clinical studies have not permitted to confirm the pathogenic role of MTX in pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
20408438,"[Incidence of serum rheumatoid factors in elder non-rheumatic individuals]With the aging of the Japanese population, an increase in the number of elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) has been noted in recent years. Although rheumatoid factor (RF) is found in a high proportion of RA patients, it is also known to be present in non-rheumatoid patients. However, no studies have investigated the rate of RF positivity in elderly non-rheumatoid individuals. In this study, we examined the rate of RF positivity in such individuals and the association between smoking and RF production. The subjects were 25 men (aged 67 to 87 years, with a mean of 74.0) and 24 women (aged 60 to 86 years, with a mean of 70.7). Of these subjects, nine (18.4%), including seven men, were RF-positive. A significant positive correlation was observed between age and RF values (n=49, p&lt;0.05). Of 23 subjects with a smoking habit, eight (34.8%) were RF-positive. In contrast, only one (3.8%) of 26 nonsmokers was RF-positive. This difference in the rate of RF positivity was significant (p&lt;0.01). In addition, a significant positive correlation was noted between the duration of smoking and rate of RF positivity (p&lt;0.05), particularly in men (p&lt;0.01).

20398022,"Insulin resistance in rheumatoid arthritis: the impact of the anti-TNF-alpha therapy.Increased prevalence of insulin resistance has been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). High-grade systemic inflammation is implicated in the development of insulin resistance in these patients. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that plays a role in the initiation and progression of inflammation and the mechanisms associated with accelerated atherosclerosis in RA. In assessing data immediately prior to and after intravenous infusion of the anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody-infliximab in RA patients on period treatment with this drug attributable to disease refractory to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, a dramatic improvement of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity was observed. A long-term positive effect of TNF-alpha antagonists infliximab and etanercept on insulin resistance in RA patients with severe disease was also reported. These results highlight the importance of therapies that act blocking TNF-alpha function to reduce the mechanisms implicated in the development of the metabolic syndrome observed in RA.",M2
20398020,"Early disease control by low-dose prednisone comedication may affect the quality of remission in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.In order to identify rate and stability of remission induced by low-dose prednisone comedication in early rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), we evaluated patients with early RA (&lt;1 year) who were randomized to receive (P) or not (non-P) low-dose prednisone in association with step-up disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy over 2 years. Prevalence and duration of clinical remission were evaluated in the first and second year. Each treatment group included 105 patients; no significant differences were found at baseline. During the first year, P patients achieved higher rates of clinical remission with a time-averaged odds ratio (OR) of 1.965 (CI 95% 1.214-3.182, P= 0.006). Moreover, they showed a higher probability of sustained remission during the second year (OR 4.480, CI 95% 1.354-14.817, P= 0.014). In conclusion, we found as in early RA low-dose prednisone comedication is associated with higher rate of clinical remission, earlier disease activity control and more stable remission over time.",M2
20398018,"Effect of novel therapeutic glucocorticoids on circadian rhythms of hormones and cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis.The morning stiffness and pain of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is accompanied by a rise in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) from 2 am to 7 am. Using a formulation that releases prednisone at 2 am (after ingestion at 10 pm), we studied the circadian dynamics of serum IL-6, other cytokines, and cortisol in 9 patients before and after 2 weeks, therapy. Significant improvements occurred in morning stiffness, pain, disease activity, and the acute-phase response. Only IL-6 showed measurable cytokine circadian variation, its high pretreatment peak was abolished, and changes in IL-6 correlated with the changes in morning stiffness. Following treatment, afternoon and evening serum cortisol was reduced, but in the early morning cortisol peak concentration increased. Thus the severity of morning symptoms is related to nocturnal serum IL-6 concentration. The specific timing of the medication, linked to the interaction between IL-6 and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, may correct a postulated deficiency in HPA control in RA.",M2
20398017,"Low-dose glucocorticoid therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: an obligatory therapy.Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used extensively in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). Recent data on the efficacy of these drugs in alleviating symptoms of inflammation, but also in retarding erosive damage, are presented. In addition, a critical review of the rather limited literature on adverse effects of chronic use of low dose GCs is given. It becomes clear that the net effect of low-dose GCs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis favors the beneficial aspects of these drugs above the negative aspects. Prudent use of GCs can be recommended.",M2
20398016,"Endomorphins in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and experimental arthritis.The opioid tetrapeptides endomorphins (EM)-1 and EM-2 are widely expressed in central nervous system and immune tissues of rats and humans. Their analgesic properties are well characterized but they also have anti-inflammatory properties. EM-1 significantly attenuated the onset of hindpaw inflammation in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of EMs in T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in synovial tissues from patients with osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). In an ex vivo superfusion system, EM-1 potently inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 from synovial tissues from patients with osteo- or RA. These results demonstrate that EMs are endogenously synthesized within human immune cells and have the potential to act as potent therapeutic agents in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease. We discuss the clinical potential for EM analogues chemically modified to resist proteolytic degradation and identify modified protease-resistant analogues with enhanced bioactivity.",M2
20398002,"Inflammatory gene profile in early rheumatoid arthritis and modulation by leflunomide and prednisone treatment.The effects of low dose prednisone (PD) alone or in combination with leflunomide (LEF) were tested on inflammatory gene expression in early rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). Ten RA patients were assigned as group A (untreated)and group B (pretreated with PD 5 mg/day for 3 months -T0). Therefore, both groups were treated with LFN (20mg/day). Expression ratio of 34 inflammatory genes was detected by microarray analysis in early RA patients and CNT (5), before (T0), and after 3 months (T1) of combined therapy (PN+LFN). At T0, 17 genes linked with arthritis were found altered in early RA, (A and B groups), compared to CNT. At T1 in the group A, 41% of genes were found unchanged, 12% upregulated, and 47% downregulated, whereas in the group B, 65% of genes were found unchanged, 6% upregulated, and 29% downregulated. The results suggest that the combination of PN and LEF seems to play a synergistic effect by modulating some inflammatory genes in early RA.",M2
20398001,"Genetics in neuroendocrine immunology: implications for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) as well as osteoarthritis (OA). For RA, most of the known genetic markers are linked with genes from immunological pathways. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C. These association signals explain more than 50% of the genetic influence on RA. In contrast, less GWAS data for OA exist. Most OA susceptibility genes arose from classical candidate gene analyses and were not replicated in all study samples. Neuroendocrine factors are hypothesized to play an important role both in RA and OA etiology. Here, we discuss these findings and present an outlook for genetic association studies after GWAS.",M2

20393970,"Methotrexate monotherapy versus methotrexate combination therapy with non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is among the most effective disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) with less toxicity and better tolerability. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MTX monotherapy compared to MTX combination with non-biologic DMARDs in adult with RA. SEARCH STRATEGY: Trials were identified in MEDLINE (1950 to 2009), EMBASE (1980 to 2009), the Cochrane Controlled trials Registry (CENTRAL) (up to 2009), the American and European scientific meeting abstracts 2005-9, the reference lists of all relevant studies, letters, and review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing MTX monotherapy versus MTX combined with other non-biologic DMARDs of at least 12 weeks of trial duration in adult RA patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies,extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias of relevant studies.The efficacy analysis was stratified into 3 groups based on previous DMARDs use: DMARD naive, MTX inadequate response, and non-MTX DMARDs inadequate response. The toxicity analysis was stratified by DMARD combination and pooled across trials for each combination. Our prespecified primary analysis was based on total withdrawal rates for efficacy or toxicity. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 19 trials (2,025 patients) from 6,938 citations were grouped by the type of patients randomised. Trials in DMARD naive patients showed no significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy; withdrawals for lack of efficacy or toxicity were similar in both groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% CI.0.70 to 1.93, absolute risk difference(ARD) 5%, 95%CI-3% to 13%). Trials in MTX or non-MTX DMARDs inadequate responder patients also showed no difference in withdrawal rates between the MTX combo versus mono groups with RR 0.86 95% CI 0.49 to1.51, ARD -2 %, 95% CI-13 % to 8 % and RR 0.75 95% CI 0.41 to 1.35, ARD -10%, 95% CI -31% to 11%, respectively. Significant reductions of pain and improvement in physical function (measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire or HAQ) were found in the MTX combination group, but only in MTX-inadequate responders (absolute risk difference -9.72%, 95%CI -14.7% to -4.75% for pain and mean difference (MD) -0.28, 95%CI -0.36 to -0.21 (0-3) for HAQ). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When the balance of efficacy and toxicity is taken into account, the moderate level of evidence from our systematic review showed no statistically significant advantage of the MTX combination versus monotherapy. Trials are needed that compare currently used MTX doses and combination therapies.",M2
20391513,"Denosumab-mediated increase in hand bone mineral density associated with decreased progression of bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis patients.OBJECTIVE: Periarticular osteoporosis is one of the earliest radiographic signs of bone damage in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). Denosumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, inhibits bone erosion and systemic bone loss in clinical studies of patients with RA. In this hand bone mineral density (BMD) substudy, we investigated the effects of denosumab on hand BMD and its correlation with hand erosion scores. METHODS: Patients receiving methotrexate for erosive RA were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous placebo, denosumab 60 mg, or denosumab 180 mg at 0 and 6 months. Measurements included BMD (by dual x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) of both hands (0, 1, 6, and 12 months), magnetic resonance images of the hands/wrists (0 and 6 months), and radiographs of the hands/wrists and feet (0, 6, and 12 months). RESULTS: There were 56 patients (13 placebo, 21 denosumab 60 mg, and 22 denosumab 180 mg). Mean changes in hand BMD at 6 and 12 months were: +0.8% and +1.0%, respectively, for denosumab 60 mg; +2.0% and +2.5%, respectively, for denosumab 180 mg; and -1.2% and -2.0%, respectively, for placebo. Erosion scores remained near baseline in the denosumab groups and increased from baseline in the placebo group. A negative correlation was observed between hand BMD and erosion scores. CONCLUSION: In patients with RA, denosumab provided protection against erosion, and not only prevented bone loss but increased hand BMD as measured by DXA.",M2
20391510,"Low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of rheumatoid arthritis: the Women's Health Study.OBJECTIVE: Low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) through its effect on cyclooxygenase activity and its antioxidant pathways. Previous randomized trial data have demonstrated a beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin in reducing other inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and colorectal adenomas, but no trial has evaluated the role of aspirin in RA prevention. METHODS: The Women's Health Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 1992 and 2004 designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin (100 mg every other day) and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 39,876 female health care professionals age &gt; or =45 years throughout the US. After excluding women with RA at baseline, 39,144 women were evaluated for the present study. A definite diagnosis of RA was assessed during followup by self-report and confirmed using a connective tissue disease screening questionnaire, followed by a medical record review by a rheumatologist for American College of Rheumatology criteria. RESULTS: During an average followup of 10 years, 106 women developed definite RA (48 women in the aspirin group and 58 in the placebo group). There was a nonsignificant risk for RA (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56-1.21; P = 0.33) associated with aspirin. There were 64 seropositive RA cases (60%) and 42 seronegative RA cases (40%). Aspirin also had no significant effect on either seropositive RA (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.61-1.63) or seronegative RA (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33-1.15). CONCLUSION: One hundred milligrams of aspirin taken every other day was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing RA among women in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",M2
20391509,"Denosumab prevents metacarpal shaft cortical bone loss in patients with erosive rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Osteoclast-mediated bone loss in the hand predicts future bone erosions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). Osteoclast activity depends on RANKL, which is inhibited by denosumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL. We measured metacarpal shaft cortical bone thickness using a novel computer-based technique, digital x-ray radiogrammetry (DXR), to evaluate the effects of denosumab on cortical bone in RA. METHODS: Patients (n = 227) with active, erosive RA were randomized to receive subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg or 180 mg or placebo every 6 months. All patients received stable doses of methotrexate and daily calcium and vitamin D. For this blinded post hoc analysis (n = 218), cortical bone loss was determined by DXR using computer-assisted measurement of cortical thickness and shaft width at 21 midshaft levels of the second through fourth metacarpal bones of both hands. RESULTS: At 12 months, patients receiving denosumab had significantly less metacarpal bone loss versus placebo (denosumab 60 mg: -0.0034, denosumab 180 mg: 0.0001 gain, placebo: -0.0108; P &lt; or = 0.01 for both denosumab doses). Twelve-month decreases from baseline greater than the smallest detectable change occurred in 2 patients in the denosumab 180 mg group, 9 patients in the denosumab 60 mg group, and 12 patients in the placebo group. Negative correlation was significant between static cortical thickness ratios and static erosion scores (6 and 12 months), and for placebo, between changes in erosion scores and changes in cortical thickness ratio. CONCLUSION: Twice-yearly injections of denosumab with ongoing methotrexate treatment significantly reduced cortical bone loss in RA patients for up to 12 months. These results add to the growing evidence supporting the clinical utility of DXR.",M2
20391483,"Motivation as a determinant of physical activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: A sufficient level of physical activity is important in reducing the impact of disease in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients. According to self-determination theory, the achievement and maintenance of physical activity is related to goal setting and ownership, which can be supported by health professionals. Our objective was to examine the association between physical activity and the extent to which RA patients 1) believe that physical activity is a goal set by themselves (autonomous regulation) or by others (coerced regulation) and 2) feel supported by rheumatologists (autonomy supportiveness). METHOD: A random selection of 643 RA patients from the outpatient clinics of 3 hospitals were sent a postal survey to assess current physical activity level (Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity), regulation style (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire), and the autonomy supportiveness of their rheumatologists (modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire). RESULTS: Of the 271 patients (42%) who returned the questionnaire, 178 (66%) were female, their mean +/- SD age was 62 +/- 14 years, and their mean +/- SD disease duration was 10 +/- 8 years. Younger age, female sex, higher education level, shorter disease duration, lower disease activity, and a more autonomous regulation were univariately associated with more physical activity. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that younger age and a more autonomous regulation were significantly associated with a higher physical activity level (P = 0.000 and 0.050, respectively). CONCLUSION: Regulation style was a significant determinant of physical activity in RA patients. This finding may contribute to further development of interventions to enhance physical activity in RA patients.",M2
20391501,"Risk of revision for infection in primary total hip and knee arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with osteoarthritis: a prospective, population-based study on 108,786 hip and knee joint arthroplasties from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register.OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in the risk of revision for infection and changes in risk over time and in time from primary surgery to revision for infection after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. METHODS: In the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, 6,629 and 102,157 primary total joint replacements in patients with RA and OA, respectively, were identified from 1987 (1994 for knees) until 2008. Survival analyses with revision due to infection as the end point were performed using Kaplan-Meier methods for constructing survival curves and multiple Cox regression to calculate relative risk (RR) estimates for diagnosis, age, sex, and year of primary surgery. An extended Cox model was used to estimate RR within different followup intervals. RESULTS: RA patients with TKR had a 1.6 times higher risk of revision for infection than OA patients, whereas there was no difference in the THRs. In the THRs, we found a higher risk of revision for infection from 2001 onward, whereas the development for TKRs was the opposite. These time effects affected the RA and OA groups equally. The risk of revision for infection from 6 years postoperatively on was higher in RA patients. CONCLUSION: The overall risk of revision for infection after TKR was higher in RA patients. The risk of late infection leading to revision of the TKR and THR was higher in RA patients than in OA patients. After the year 2000, the RR of revision for infection in RA compared with OA remained unchanged.",M2
20391481,"Impact of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 on utilization and spending for medicare part B-covered biologics in rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in utilization and expenditures for infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients associated with the 2 changes implemented by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, specifically 1) reductions in physician reimbursement for Part B drugs between 2003 and 2005 and 2) availability of alternative RA biologics in 2006. METHODS: Using 2002-2006 5% Medicare files, nationally representative estimates of infliximab use and expenditures were estimated in annual cross-sectional samples of RA beneficiaries. Infliximab initiation and continuation rates were estimated in 2-year longitudinal cohorts (2005-2006 versus 2002-2003, 2003-2004, and 2004-2005). RESULTS: Total payments (in 2006 dollars) for infliximab increased from $357 million in 2002 to $492 million in 2006. The largest annual increase in infliximab payments occurred in the pre-MMA period from 2002 to 2003, wherein payments per RA patient increased by 31%. From 2003 to 2004, despite the reduction in payments brought by the MMA, there was a 4% increase in total expenditures for infliximab per RA patient driven by an increase in utilization factors. Total payments for infliximab per RA patient actually decreased from 2004 to 2005, when reimbursement was further reduced. Continuation and initiation rates for infliximab use remained unchanged in 2006, as compared with previous years. CONCLUSION: Infliximab expenditures increased from 2002 to 2006, yet the passage of the MMA was associated with a remarkable slowdown in the rate of increase in expenditures. There was no evidence of significant substitution of infliximab with other biologics made available in 2006.",M2
20391482,"Excess mortality emerges after 10 years in an inception cohort of early rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate mortality rates, causes of death, time trends in mortality, prognostic factors for mortality, and the relationship between disease activity and mortality over a 23-year period in an inception cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients. METHODS: A prospective inception cohort of RA patients diagnosed between January 1985 and October 2007 was followed for up to 23 years after diagnosis. Excess mortality was analyzed by comparing the observed mortality in the RA cohort with the expected mortality based on the general population of The Netherlands, matched for age, sex, and calendar year. Period analysis was used to examine time trends in survival across calendar time. Prognostic factors for mortality and the influence of the time-varying Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) on mortality were analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Causes of death were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 1,049 patients in the cohort, 207 patients died. Differences in observed and expected mortality emerged after 10 years of followup. No improvement in survival was noted over calendar time. Significant baseline predictors of survival were sex, age, rheumatoid factor, disability, and comorbidity. Higher levels of DAS28 over time, adjusted for age, were associated with lower survival rates, more so in men (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.35-1.85) than in women (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.42). CONCLUSION: Excess mortality in RA emerged after 10 years of disease duration. Absolute survival rates have not improved in the last 23 years and a trend toward a widening mortality gap between RA patients and the general population was visible. Higher disease activity levels contribute to premature death in RA patients.",M2
20390115,"[Health-related quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: assessment by a Italian version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, Version 2 (AIMS2)]The research carried out by Censis Foundation, in collaboration with SIR (Italian Society of Rheumatology) and ANMAR (National association of rheumatic patients) involved 646 patients, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) by a rheumatologist according to ACR criteria. The patients were recruited through a representative sample of 300 general practitioners (GP). A cross-sectional survey was conducted to study the current status of health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients using a revised Italian version of a revised version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS2). The AIMS2 was administered to the 646 patients with (RA) attending arthritis clinics at various hospitals across the country. Self-report functional disability scores were calculated for all 12 specific scales, summary components, and overall impact measures. The AIMS2 has been validated for the Italian language. Ranging from 0 (perfect health) to 10 (poor health), the mean scores of the AIMS2 showed an important impact of the disease on the 4 components of the health status of these patients: walking and bending, mean score = 5.1; nervous tension = 5.0, arthritis pain = 5.0, and social activity = 4.6. Among other dimensions, the impact of RA was moderate for mood, work, hand and finger function and mobility (mean score: 3.7, 3.7, 3.5 and 3.4, respectively) and low for household tasks, arm function, self-care tasks and family support (3.0, 2.9, 2.5 and 2.1, respectively). There was a tendency for the scores of younger patients to be better than those of olders patients. In conclusion, RA have a clearly detrimental effect on the HRQL in both physical and mental components. Prevention and management of physical disability should be seriously planned in consideration of the changes in these conditions in RA patients. Use of the AIMS2 makes it easier and less costly to collect data and reduces the burden on RA patients.",M2
20391478,"Reliability of ultrasonography to detect synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review of 35 studies (1,415 patients).OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review on the reliability of ultrasonographic (US) synovitis detection in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) by B-mode and power Doppler (PD) in image acquisition and still-image interpretation. US is a sensitive method for synovitis detection. However, reliability is still a key concern. METHODS: Articles reporting any US reliability results for synovitis in RA in PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts were selected. Data were extracted from the collection of data on US synovitis detection (either qualitatively [binary] or semiquantitatively [0-3 scale], for intraobserver and interobserver reliability in B-mode and PD, and for image acquisition and still-image interpretation). The type of joints tested, the experience of the ultrasonographer, and the quality of the studies were assessed. Data analysis involved descriptive and graphic interpretation of reliability and its potential determinants. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (12 for B-mode, 11 for PD, or 12 for both) with a total of 1,415 patients were analyzed. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability for still images in B-mode and PD was high (kappa = 0.5-1.0 [14,991 joints] for intraobserver reliability for B-mode, kappa = 0.59-1.0 [14,934 joints] for PD, kappa = 0.49-1.0 [3,138 joints] for interobserver for B-mode, and kappa = 0.66-1.0 [3,325 joints] for PD). Interobserver reliability for image acquisition in both US modes was lower than still-image interpretation (kappa = 0.22-0.95). Few studies reported intraobserver image acquisition reliability. CONCLUSION: Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of still-image interpretation was high, especially for PD, in published studies involving highly trained observers. However, reliability of acquisition of US should be further assessed.",M2
20382605,"The effect of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy with etanercept on endothelial functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha antagonism with etanercept (ENC) on endothelial functions in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: A total of 21 patients with RA were enrolled in this prospective study. Eleven of them (8 women, 3 men mean age 47.0+/-10.1 years) with high disease activity despite the conventional treatment were assigned to Group 1 and were given ENC treatment twice a week (25 mg SC injection) for 12 weeks. Ten patients with RA (8 women, 2 men mean age 55.0+/-6.4 years) under conventional methotrexate and prednisone therapy were assigned as Control group (Group 2). Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator responses of the brachial artery were assessed by high-resolution ultrasound. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured at baseline and at the post treatment period. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the data and correlation analysis was performed using Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation improved from 5.2+/-0.8% to 7.9+/-1.3% (p=0.04) in ENC group, while no significant change was observed in the control group (from 6.6+/-1.1% to 7.0+/-1.8% p=0.67). No significant changes were found in endothelium-independent vasodilatation and baseline brachial artery diameters in both groups. A significant reduction in ESR and CRP were observed in patients receiving ENC (from 16.2+/-6.8 to 9.2+/-5.1 mm/h, p=0.003 and from 14.68+/-3.4 to 9.25+/-3.7 mg/L, p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Treatment with ENC for 12 weeks significantly improved endothelial function in patients with active RA compared to those under conventional therapy. The findings of the present study support the hypothesis that the use of TNF-alpha blockers in patients with active RA may reduce the high incidence of cardiovascular complications.",M2
20383892,"Update on the genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a complex disease, meaning that multiple genetic variants, environmental factors and random events interact to trigger pathological pathways. Although many of these etiological factors have not yet been identified, recent groundbreaking advances have expanded our knowledge about the genetic factors that contribute to RA. Here, we review the most recent findings on the genetic risk factors for RA. First, we give an overview of the genetics of RA and briefly describe the susceptibility loci discovered prior to the availability of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Second, we focus on the newly discovered RA loci that have arisen from GWAS in populations of European ancestry. Through these studies, the number of established RA susceptibility loci has now grown to 13. Third, we discuss several important issues emerging from GWAS, such as ethnic heterogeneity and shared autoimmunity risk loci. Finally, we discuss what still needs to be accomplished before a more complete picture of the genetic risk to RA can be attained.",M2
20375422,"omega-3 Fatty acids infusions as adjuvant therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the efficacy and safety of parenteral omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 FA) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 23 patients with moderate to severe RA. Patients received either 0.2 g of fish oil emulsion/kg (active) or 0.9% saline (placebo) infusion intravenously for 14 consecutive days, followed by 20 weeks of 0.05 g of fish oil/kg (active) or paraffin wax (placebo) ingested orally as capsules. A decrease in swollen and tender joint counts was the primary efficacy measure. RESULTS: At baseline, both swollen and tender joint counts were not significantly different between patients in the treatment and placebo groups. Twenty patients completed the infusion portion of the study, and 13 completed the oral portion. Swollen joint count was significantly lower in the omega-3 FA group compared with the placebo group after 1 week of infusion (P = .002) as well as after 2 weeks of infusion (P = .046). Tender joint count also tended to be lower in the omega-3 FA group, although this did not reach statistical significance. Both swollen and tender joint counts were significantly lower in the omega-3 FA group compared with the placebo group during and at the end of oral treatment. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study indicates that parenteral omega-3 FAs are well tolerated and improve clinical symptoms of RA. Subsequent oral administration of omega-3 FAs may prolong the beneficial effects of the infusion therapy. These results warrant validation in larger multicenter studies.",M2

We assessed the FMD response to anti-TNF-alpha treatments in 28 RA patients, aged 49.8+/-15.3 years: an unpaired FMD was found in 66.7 percent of our cases and was restored after 6 weeks of anti-TNF-á treatment (13.5+/-5.3 percent vs 4.6+/-4.1 percent, p less than 0.05). Twenty-five percent of the infliximab patients demonstrated a long term response, compared with 60 percent of etanercept and 100 percent of adalimumab patients, after 2 years (p less than 0.01). Infections (3 cases), myocardial ischemia (1 case) or loss of response (4 cases) were associated with a worsened FMD, restored by shifting to adalimumab. The present study confirms that ED is an RA systemic disease marker, responsive to anti-TNF-alpha treatment and sensitive to clinical events or to a loss of response, underlying the biological coherence between synovial and endothelial inflammation.",M2
20374381,"Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and risk of serious infection in rheumatoid arthritis.Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical and radiological benefits in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). However, they have important adverse effects including an association with infection. Results from current studies, including meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, are conflicting regarding the risk of serious infection in RA patients treated with TNF inhibitors. The majority of data suggest an increased risk, in particular of respiratory, skin and soft tissue infections, including tuberculosis. This increased risk of tuberculosis is of particular concern in the APLAR region. However, adverse event analysis remains a difficult area to study and decisions regarding initiation of TNF inhibitors must be made on a case-by-case basis after carefully considering the risks and benefits.",M2
20374384,"The effects of an orally administered probiotic on sulfasalazine metabolism in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis: a preliminary study.AIM: To carry out a pilot study to investigate the effect of short-term oral probiotic administration on the metabolism of sulfasalazine (SSZ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) stabilized on SSZ. METHODS: Twelve subjects with RA taking stable doses of SSZ for a minimum of 3 months prior to the study, received a probiotic preparation contained three strains of bacteria (1.8 x 10(9) CFU/day) twice daily for 1 week. Single point blood and 12-h urine samples were taken before and after probiotic treatment and 3 weeks following discontinuation of probiotics, for determination of SSZ and its metabolites. The presence of the probiotic bacteria in the feces of patients was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: Adverse events recorded were three instances of gastrointestinal disturbance and one flare of RA. Plasma and urinary levels of SSZ and its metabolites showed no statistically significant changes after probiotic administration and the incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance did not appear to be ascribed to higher sulfapyridine plasma levels. Probiotic-specific DGGE bands were detected in the feces of some patients after the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term treatment of RA patients with a multi-strain probiotic did not significantly influence SSZ metabolism as has been demonstrated in animal models.",M2
20374348,"Prevalence of anti cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in Malaysian rheumatoid arthritis patients and its correlation with disease activity.AIM: The objectives of this study are to provide data regarding the prevalence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies in Malaysian rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients and to correlate the levels of anti-CCP antibody with the Disease Activity Score (DAS). METHOD: We studied the prevalence of anti-CCP antibodies in 51 RA patients attending our clinic and 29 controls. We also looked for correlation between anti-CCP antibody levels with the DAS and parameters such as duration of disease, rheumatoid factor (RF) and disease-modifying anti rheumatic drug (DMARD) usage. RESULTS: None of the controls demonstrated anti-CCP antibodies. Forty-one out of 51 patients (80.4%) were positive for anti-CCP antibodies. Sensitivity and specificity were 80.4% and 100% respectively in this study. Anti-CCP levels correlated significantly with rheumatoid factor, but no correlation was observed with the other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CCP antibody is prevalent in Malaysian RA patients at 80.4% and more sensitive than RF in our cohort of established RA patients. Even though the anti-CCP levels correlated with RF, it did not show correlation with DAS.",M2
20374373,"Rheumatoid arthritis in paintings: a tale of two origins.Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is thought to be a 'recent' disease in that descriptions of it were only noted in the 17th century. However, a study of paintings would suggest that RA could have been present as early as the 15th century, when artists started to paint the human body accurately rather than figuratively. Thus, it was possible to deduce from their paintings the occurrence of various medical conditions. If present, RA with its typical finger deformities should be apparent. This review discusses the known occurrences of RA-type deformities in paintings and places this in the context of the origins of the disease.",M2
20374312,"Effect of conjugated linoleic acids, vitamin E and their combination on the clinical outcome of Iranian adults with active rheumatoid arthritis.BACKGROUND: Despite beneficial effects of conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) in animal studies, there is little information on their effects on human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. AIM: To investigate the effects of CLAs as an adjuvant therapy on the clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) in adults with an active disease. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 87 patients with active RA were divided into four groups receiving one of the following daily supplements for 3 months: group C: CLAs 2.5 g equivalent to 2 g mixture of cis 9-trans 11 and trans 10-cis12 CLAs at a rate of 50/50; group E: vitamin E: 400 mg; group CE: CLAs and vitamin E at above doses; group P: placebo. Serum alpha-tocopherol was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Clinical data was determined by physician examination and filling the questionnaire by interview. Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive protein (CRP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were measured in each patient. DAS28 (diseases activity score) was also determined. RESULTS: A 3-month supplementation resulted significant reduction in DAS28, pain and morning stiffness in the groups C and CE compared with group P (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the baseline, ESR levels decreased significantly in the groups C (P &lt; or = 0.05), E (P &lt; or = 0.05) and CE (P &lt; or = 0.001). Group CE had significantly lower ESR levels than group P (P v 0.05). CRP dropped non-significantly in all four groups (P &gt; 0.1). The reduction of white blood cell count was significant in group CE compared with other groups (P &lt; 0.05). Decrease in platelet count was non-significant in groups CE, C, and E. Changes in RF, body mass index, red blood cell count and hemoglobin were not significant in four groups, while RF decreased non-significantly in groups CE and E. In comparison with the baseline, alpha-tocopherol increased significantly in groups C (P &lt; or = 0.05), E (P &lt; or = 0.01) and CE (P &lt; or = 0.001) and in groups E and CE compared with group P. CONCLUSION: CLA supplementation resulted in significant improvement in clinical manifestation among RA patients and may be useful in their treatments.",M2
20374331,"Clinical and high resolution computed tomography characteristics of patients with rheumatoid arthritis lung disease.INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a systemic disease of unknown cause. A variety of pulmonary disorders have been described in association with RA. Among the most common are interstitial lung disease (ILD) and bronchiectasis. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the characteristics of RA patients with lung disease in relation to clinical characteristics, pulmonary function test (PFT) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax. METHOD: This is a 6-months cross-sectional study involving 63 consecutive RA patients in an outpatient rheumatology clinic. Patients had a mean disease duration of 5 years and above. Disease activity and severity was assessed by Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Rheumatoid Arthritis Articular Damage (RAAD) score. Full pulmonary function test (PFT) and HRCT of thorax were performed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of RA-ILD is 44% and 67% of patients are asymptomatic. There was significant higher proportion (68%) in patients of Chinese ethnicity who have ILD. Diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide was abnormal in all patients and forced expiratory flow (FEF)(25-75%) was low in 16%. Restrictive pattern was 66.7% by PFT. The most common HRCT findings were reticulation (46%) followed by ground glass opacities (38.1%) and bronchiectasis (28.6%). There was no association between ILD and male gender, duration of the disease, smoking, rheumatoid factor, extra-articular manifestations, disease activity or severity.",M2
20367977,"Screening disease-associated proteins from sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a comparative proteomic study.BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation at the synovial membrane. Although great progress has been made recently in exploring the etiology and pathogenesis of RA, its molecular pathological mechanism remains to be further defined and it is still a great challenge in determining the diagnosis and in choosing the appropriate therapy in early patients. This study was performed to screen candidate RA-associated serum proteins by comparative proteomics to provide research clues to early diagnosis and treatment of RA. METHODS: Sera isolated from 6 RA patients and 6 healthy volunteers were pooled respectively and high-abundance proteins were depleted by Plasma 7 Multiple Affinity Removal System. The protein expression profiles between the two groups were then compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and the proteins over/under-expressed by more than 3-fold were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. To validate the differential expression levels of the identified proteins between the two groups, ELISA was performed in two of the identified proteins in individual sera from 32 RA patients and 32 volunteers. RESULTS: Eight proteins which over/under-expressed in sera of RA patients were identified. Among them, chain A of transthyretin (TTR) was under-expressed, while serum amyloid A protein, apolipoprotein A (ApoA)-IV, ApoA-IV precursor, haptoglobin 2, ceruloplasmin (Cp), immunoglobulin superfamily 22 and HT016 were over-expressed. ELISA test confirmed that Cp expressed remarkably higher while TTR obviously lower in RA group compared with volunteer group. CONCLUSION: There were 8 identified proteins differentially expressed between RA group and volunteer group, which might be candidate RA-associated proteins and might be promising diagnostic indicators or therapeutic targets for RA.",M2
20374310,"Histological analysis of synovium by treatment of etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis.AIMS: In order to investigate the histological change in effect attenuation cases of etanercept compared with methotrexate (MTX), we performed immunohistochemical examination by seven different molecules. METHODS: We histologically assessed synovial tissue from five MTX-treated rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients as control and six etanercept and MTX-treated RA patients after synovectomy by arthroscopy. The synovium of both groups were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and we also analysed the expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), B-cell precursors and mature B-cell transmembrane protein, CD20, macrophage marker, CD68, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: HE staining showed vascular and cell proliferations of the synovium of the RA patients who received etanercept compared with the control MTX group. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were expressed in both groups.MMP-3 and CD68 expressed less significantly in the etanercept group compared with the control (P &lt; 0.05). CD20 strongly expressed in the etanercept group significantly (P &lt; 0.05). BrdU expressed in the synovium in the etanercept group significantly (P &lt; 0.05). VEGF was not found overall in both group. CONCLUSION: Based on the histological change of synovium, treatment by etanercept may be involved in vascular and cell proliferations with inhibition of the expression of CD68 and MMP-3 in synovium of RA patients. These findings indicate immunohistochemical change of synovium with etanercept is one of the mechanism of efficacy of etanercept.",M2
20360783,"Podiatry services for patients with arthritis: an unmet need.Foot problems are extremely common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). There is ample evidence that foot pain, either alone or as a comorbidity, contributes significantly to disability. Despite the high prevalence of foot disease in RA, this problem is often trivialised or underappreciated. The inequity in foot health provision for patients with rheumatic disorders in New Zealand has recently been highlighted. Expertise in dealing with foot problems is often limited among healthcare professionals, and it has been argued that better integration of podiatric services into rheumatology services would be beneficial. The aim of this paper is to highlight the major issues related to foot care for patients with arthritis and provide key recommendations that should implemented to improve access to podiatric services in New Zealand.",M2
20361968,"Development and optimization of a cell-based neutralizing antibody assay using a sample pre-treatment step to eliminate serum interference.We developed a neutralizing antibody assay (NAb assay), based upon the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity of a monoclonal human IgG(1) therapeutic (IgT), to characterize anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) in autoimmune patient serum. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were measured by a decrease in the extent of CDC mediated by 50 ng/mL IgT, on a lymphoblastoid cell line. A sample pre-treatment procedure, utilizing a Protein A/G resin to purify total immunoglobulins, was optimized for use in the NAb assay to eliminate the non-specific assay interferents observed in individual serum samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients. In some individuals, the addition of naïve serum to the assay completely inhibited CDC activity. After sample pre-treatment, the variability of the CDC response induced by IgT in individual serum samples from a drug-naïve <e>RA</e> population, tested over three days, was only 3%, irrespective of complement immune complexes or rheumatoid factor levels. The pre-treatment procedure was performed on samples and matrix controls as part of each assay. The NAb assay was able to recover and detect polyclonal ATA from human serum at a concentration of 0.25 microg/mL with pre-treatment. Dose-dependent neutralization of IgT was observed, however, a simple positive/negative reporting scheme was adopted. The NAb assay was found to have the desired properties of specificity, robustness, precision and recovery for validation to support the characterization of ATA in clinical samples.",M2
20359615,"[Interstitial lung disease and anti-TNF-alpha therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: Two different patterns?]The first lung complications of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) that were reported were infections. Recently, interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been described as a consequence of this treatment. We report two cases of women treated with anti-TNF-alpha therapy for RA who both developed exacerbations of their preexisting ILD thought to be due to the treatment. In one case, this complication occurred 2 months after anti-TNF-alpha therapy, whereas the delay of occurrence was 26 months in the second case. Based on these two cases and on the first 40 observations in the literature, we hypothesize that ILD may be exacerbated according to two distinct patterns during anti-TNF-alpha treatment for RA, occurring early (most frequently) or late after treatment was started, with a mean of 4 and 26 months, respectively. Other features that may differ between these two presentations include the risk factors, the anti-TNF-alpha molecule used, the histopathological pattern, and the prognosis.",M2
20360402,"Dual targeting of CCR2 and CCR5: therapeutic potential for immunologic and cardiovascular diseases.A cardinal feature of inflammation is the tissue recruitment of leukocytes, a process that is mediated predominantly by chemokines via their receptors on migrating cells. CCR2 and CCR5, two CC chemokine receptors, are important players in the trafficking of monocytes/macrophages and in the functions of other cell types relevant to disease pathogenesis. This review provides a brief overview of the biological actions of CCR2 and CCR5 and a comprehensive summary of published data that demonstrate the involvement of both receptors in the pathogenesis of immunologic diseases (<e>RA</e>, CD, and transplant rejection) and cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis and AIH). In light of the potential for functional redundancy of chemokine receptors in mediating leukocyte trafficking and the consequent concern over insufficient efficacy offered by pharmacologically inhibiting one receptor, this review presents evidence supporting dual targeting of CCR2 and CCR5 as a more efficacious strategy than targeting either receptor alone. It also examines potential safety issues associated with such dual targeting.",M2
20346251,"Prognostic factors for erosive rheumatoid arthritis.The course of rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) varies among patients, ranging from a mild disease with a small impact on patient's functional capacity to a severe, erosive and catastrophic disease accompanied by subluxations, deformities and subsequent poor quality of life. In clinical practice, the prediction of the outcome of RA is substantial in terms of making the right therapeutic decision for each patient. Reliable prognostic factors of long-term outcome are needed, so as to distinguish patients prone to severe disease course from patients with a smaller probability of severe structural damage. For the former group early aggressive treatment is required, whereas in the latter group remission may be achieved with less aggressive and potentially less toxic treatments. In the present review, the predictive role of demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, immunological and genetic characteristics of RA patients is discussed.",M2
20351705,"The role of endothelial function and its assessment in rheumatoid arthritis.Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) have a reduced life expectancy when compared with the general population, largely attributable to cardiovascular disease. Factors that contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk include traditional risk factors, which account for only part of the excess, along with manifestations of the disease itself. RA is characterized by inflammation, which also is a key component in the development of atherosclerosis. Inflammation leads to the activation of endothelial cells, which, through an increase in the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, promotes a pro-atherosclerotic environment. Endothelial dysfunction is an early preclinical marker of atherosclerosis, and is commonly found in patients with RA. Several methods are available for the assessment of endothelial function, such as flow-mediated dilatation and laser Doppler flowmetry combined with iontophoresis, each with its own advantages and limitations. Studies have shown that endothelial dysfunction in RA is closely associated with inflammation, and therapeutic reduction of inflammation leads to improvements in endothelial function. As such, assessments of endothelial function could prove to be useful tools in the identification and monitoring of cardiovascular risk in patients with RA. Given the increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with RA, effective management must involve prevention of cardiovascular risk, in addition to control of disease activity and inflammation.",M2
20346243,"Three-dimensional volumetric ultrasonography. Does it improve reliabililty of musculoskeletal ultrasound?OBJECTIVE: To compare the interobserver reliability of three-dimensional (3D) volumetric ultrasonography (US) and 2D real-time US in detecting inflammatory and destructive changes in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) wrist and hand. METHODS: Two RA patients were selected by a rheumatologist who performed independently a grey-scale and power Doppler (PD) volumetric acquisition at three anatomic sites in their more symptomatic wrist/hand using two identical scanners equipped with 3D volumetric probe. Twelve rheumatologists expert in MSUS were randomly assigned to a US scanner and a patient. In the first part of the study, each group of experts blindly, independently, and consecutively performed a 2D real-time grey-scale and PD US investigation of inflammatory changes and/or bone erosions at the three anatomic sites. In the second part of the study, each group of investigators blindly evaluated the same pathologic changes in the 6 volumes from the patient not scanned by them. RESULTS: The kappa values were higher for 3D volumetric US than for 2D US in the detection of synovitis/tenosyno-vitis (0.41 vs. 0.37) and PD signal (0.82 vs 0.45) and in the PD signal grading (0.81 vs. 0.55). CONCLUSION: 3D volumetric US may improve the interobserver reliability in RA multicentre studies.",M2
20346245,"Enhanced expression of mRNA for FK506-binding protein 5 in bone marrow CD34 positive cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have disclosed that several genes are up-regulated in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients. However, it remains unclear whether such abnormalities result from systemic inflammation or from abnormalities at stem cell level. The current study therefore examined the expression of several representative genes, including amphiregulin (AREG), chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), and FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in RA BM CD34+ cells. METHODS: BM samples were obtained from 52 patients with RA and 35 patients with osteroarthritis (OA) during joint operations. CD34+ cells were purified from the BM mononuclear cells by positive selection with magnetic beads. The mRNA expression for AREG, CXCR4, and FKBP5 was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The expression of mRNA for FKBP5, but not that of AREG or CXCR4, was significantly higher in RA BM CD34+ cells than in OA BM CD34+ cells. The FKBP5 mRNA expression level was not correlated with serum CRP or treatment. In addition, tumour necrosis factor-alpha did not enhance the expression of FKBP5 mRNA in BM CD34+ cells from healthy donors. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the enhanced expression of FKBP5 in BM CD34+ cells might be an intrinsic abnormality of RA BM CD34+ cells, whereas the enhanced expression of AREG and CXCR4 in BM mononuclear cells might be secondary to systemic inflammation.",M2
20346241,"Lack of association between macrophage migration inhibitory factor-173 gene polymorphism with disease susceptibility and cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients from northwestern Spain.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the polymorphism of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene at the position -173 is implicated in the disease susceptibility, risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 293 unselected patients fulfilling the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for RA seen at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of Hospital Xeral-Calde, Lugo, Spain and 526 matched controls were studied for differences in the MIF-173 G/C gene biallelic polymorphism. A total of 182 consecutive patients that had been periodically followed between March 1996 and September 1996 until patient's death or January 1, 2008 were assessed for the presence of CV events. Moreover, between March and December 2007, a subgroup of unselected RA patients with no history of CV events was studied for the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis by the assessment of the endothelial function (n=107) and the carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) (n=91) by ultrasonography studies. Patients and controls were genotyped for the MIF-173 G/C gene polymorphism using a PCR system with pre-developed TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for the MIF-173 gene polymorphism between RA patients and controls were found. Forty-four of the 182 patients followed between 1996 and January 2008 experienced CV events. Although the frequency of MIF-173 GG homozygous was increased in those who had CV events (88.6%) compared to those who did not suffer these complication (73.2%), the difference was not statistically significant. It was also the case when we analyzed the potential influence of MIF-173 genotypes in the presence of endothelial dysfunction or increased carotid IMT of patients with RA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not show that MIF-173 gene polymorphism may infer a direct risk for disease susceptibility or CV disease in patients with RA.",M2
20346242,"Renal safety of initial combination versus single DMARD therapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: an 11-year experience from the FIN-RACo Trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the renal safety of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in early rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five DMARD-naïve patients with recent-onset RA were randomised to receive combination DMARD therapy (n=97) starting with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone (COMBI) or monotherapy (n=98), initially with sulfasalazine, with or without prednisolone (SINGLE). After two years, the choice and dosing of DMARDs and prednisolone were not restricted, but the treatment was still targeted to achieve or maintain remission. Urinalysis, serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR; estimated according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula [eGFRCG]) were analysed at baseline and at months 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and thereafter yearly up to 11 years. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of repeated (&gt;or=3 times) abnormal renal findings during the 11-year follow-up period were as follows (COMBI versus SINGLE; p-values adjusted for age and sex): proteinuria (dipstick positive) 4.8% (95%CI 1.8-12.2) vs. 5.3% (95%CI 2.0-13.7, p=0.93), haematuria (dipstick positive) 14.1% (95%CI 8.0-24.2) vs. 22.1 % (95%CI 14.5-33.0, p=0.14), raised serum creatinine (&gt;or=100 micromol/l in females and &gt;or=115 micromol/l in males) 4.4% (95%CI 1.7-11.4) vs. 6.7% (3.0-14.3, p=0.87) and eGFRGC&lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 11.9% (95%CI 6.8-20.5) vs. 10.5% (95%CI 5.8-18.7, p=0.85). CONCLUSION: Initial remission targeted therapy with the FIN-RACo DMARD combination in early RA is safe for kidneys and does not induce more short- or long-term renal complications compared to traditional therapy with a single DMARD.",M2
20346234,"Association study of ghrelin receptor gene polymorphisms in rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVES: Ghrelin is a newly characterised growth hormone (GH) releasing peptide widely distributed that may play an important role in the regulation of metabolic balance in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) by decreasing the pro-inflammatory Th1 responses. In this study we investigated the possible contribution of several polymorphisms in the functional Ghrelin receptor to RA susceptibility. METHODS: A screening of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed in a total of 950 RA patients and 990 healthy controls of Spanish Caucasian origin. Genotyping of all 3 SNPs was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction technology, using the TaqMan 5'-allele discrimination assay. RESULTS: We observed no statistically significant deviation between RA patients and controls for the GHSR SNPs analysed. In addition, we performed a haplotype analysis that did not reveal an association with RA susceptibility. The stratification analysis for the presence of shared epitope (SE), rheumatoid factor (RF) or antibodies anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) did not detect significant association of the GHSR polymorphisms with RA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the GHSR gene polymorphisms do not appear to play a major role in RA genetic predisposition in our population.",M2
20346239,"Visfatin is not associated with inflammation or metabolic syndrome in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis undergoing anti-TNF-alpha therapy.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Visfatin is an insulin-mimetic adipokine. In non-rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) patients circulating levels of visfatin are correlated with the amount of visceral fat. Recent studies have disclosed an implication of visfatin in inflammation. Chronic systemic inflammation is of major importance in the development of atherosclerosis in RA. In the present study we investigated whether inflammation, obesity or metabolic syndrome are potential determinants of circulating visfatin concentrations in a group of RA patients on periodical treatment with the TNF-alpha blocker infliximab due to severe disease. We also assessed whether the infusion of infliximab may alter circulating visfatin concentrations in patients with severe RA. METHODS: We investigated 33 non-diabetic patients with RA on periodical treatment with infliximab. Serum visfatin levels were determined immediately prior to and after infliximab infusion. RESULTS: There was no correlation between body mass index of RA patients and baseline serum level of visfatin. Also, no significant correlations between baseline visfatin levels and the age at the time of the study or at the onset of the disease, disease duration, ESR and CRP levels, DAS28, lipids, insulin sensitivity, resistin or the cumulative prednisone dose at the time of the study were found. Visfatin levels did not change upon infliximab infusion. CONCLUSIONS: In RA patients on TNF-alpha blocker treatment, circulating visfatin levels are unrelated to disease activity, adiposity or metabolic syndrome. The beneficial effect of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on cardiovascular mortality in RA does not seem to be mediated by changes in serum levels of visfatin.",M2
20345981,"A role for human endogenous retrovirus-K (HML-2) in rheumatoid arthritis: investigating mechanisms of pathogenesis.Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections within the human genome. These molecular fossils draw parallels with present-day exogenous retroviruses and have been linked previously with immunopathology within rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>). Mechanisms of pathogenesis for HERV-K in RA such as molecular mimicry were investigated. To clarify a role for HERVs in RA, potential autoantigens implicated in autoimmunity were scanned for sequence identity with retroviral epitopes. Short retroviral peptides modelling shared epitopes were synthesized, to survey anti-serum of RA patients and disease controls. A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was also developed to quantify accurately levels of HERV-K (HML-2) gag expression, relative to normalized housekeeping gene expression. Both serological and molecular assays showed significant increases in HERV-K (HML-2) gag activity in RA patients, compared to disease controls. The real-time PCR assay identified significant up-regulation in HERV-K mRNA levels in RA patients compared to inflammatory and healthy controls. Exogenous viral protein expression and proinflammatory cytokines were also shown to exert modulatory effects over HERV-K (HML-2) transcription. From our data, it can be concluded that RA patients exhibited significantly elevated levels of HERV-K (HML-2) gag activity compared to controls. Additional factors influencing HERV activity within the synovium were also identified. The significant variation in RA patients, both serologically and transcriptionally, may be an indication that RA is an umbrella term for a number of separate disease entities, of which particular HERV polymorphisms may play a role in development.",M2
20346233,"Visfatin, resistin, hsCRP and insulin resistance in relation to abdominal obesity in women with rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVES: The increasing incidence of overweight and obesity in modern societies, and the demonstration that adipose tissue produces numerous cytokines, increases interest of investigators in the associations between adipose tissue, adipokines, CRP and insulin resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and their possible role in the pathogenesis of this disease.The purpose of the study was to investigate serum levels of visfatin, resistin, hsCRP and insulin resistance in relation to abdominal obesity in patients with RA. METHODS: Serum levels of visfatin, resistin, hsCRP and glucose metabolism parameters were measured in 46 women with RA - 22 without abdominal obesity and 24 with abdominal obesity. RESULTS: Patients with RA and abdominal obesity showed significant lower visfatin levels (1.00+/-0.93 vs. 1.44+/-0.85 ng/ml; p&lt;0.05) in comparison to those without abdominal obesity. We found significant correlations between levels of visfatin and resistin (r=0.41; p&lt;0.01); and between resistin levels and hsCRP levels (r=0.41; p&lt;0.01); resistin levels and leucocytes count (r=0.36; p&lt;0.05); and resistin levels and ESR (r=0.30; p&lt;0.05), in the whole investigated group. Visfatin as well as resistin did not correlate with anthropometric parameters or insulin resistance in whole patients with RA. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RA and abdominal obesity, in comparison to patients without abdominal obesity, significantly lower visfatin levels have been demonstrated. Resistin was associated with laboratory markers of inflammation. Positive correlation between levels of visfatin and resistin may suggest that visfatin plays a role in inflammation in RA.",M2
20337546,"The association of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone with cytokines and markers of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis: a case-control study.OBJECTIVES: Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) varies substantially during periods when luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels change, for example during pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We wanted to investigate whether small fluctuations in these hormones could be associated with similar fluctuations in cytokines and disease activity in RA. METHODS: Disease activity markers, serum LH, FSH, and 24 cytokines were assessed on days 1 and 8 in 20 RA patients (median age 58 years, six males) and 19 controls (median age 56 years, six males). RESULTS: Percentage changes in LH and FSH correlated positively with percentage changes in key proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha (LH r = 0.737, p = 0.0007; FSH r = 0.680, p = 0.001) and interleukin (IL)-1beta (LH r = 0.515, p = 0.050; FSH r = 0.749, p = 0.0008). Similar correlations were observed with IL-2, IL-2R, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and eotaxin, but not with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in RA and not in controls. Percentage changes in LH, FSH, and cytokines were not correlated with percentage changes of several disease activity markers but were correlated positively with cross-sectional levels of disease activity markers [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain, VAS global (physician/patient), and the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ)]. CONCLUSIONS: The significant associations between percentage changes in LH and FSH and percentage changes in key cytokines and several cross-sectional markers of disease activity may indicate that LH and FSH influence crucial points of the cytokine cascade in RA. This may help to explain, partially, why disease activity initiates or worsens during periods of increased LH and FSH, such as the postpartum period and the menopause.",M2
20332595,"Leg ulceration in rheumatoid arthritis--an underreported multicausal complication with considerable morbidity: analysis of thirty-six patients and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a systemic inflammatory disease which may present with extra-articular symptoms, including cutaneous manifestations. Ulcerated rheumatoid nodules, necrotic vasculitic lesions and pyoderma gangrenosum are fairly characteristic and well-recognized causes of skin ulcers in RA. However, most RA patients develop leg ulcers due to other pathophysiological factors posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and leading to considerable morbidity. METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of all patients with RA and leg ulcers hospitalized at our Dermatology Department between January 1998 and March 2008 was performed to evaluate risk factors and identify underlying conditions that predispose RA patients to the development of leg ulcers. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with RA and leg ulcers were identified. Three patients presented with necrotizing vasculitis and 2 with pyoderma gangrenosum. Chronic venous insufficiency was diagnosed as the underlying cause of leg ulcers in 8 patients, peripheral arterial disease in 4 patients, and combined arterial and venous malfunction in 3 patients. Five patients suffered from pressure ulcers. Interestingly, in 11 patients (31%) other underlying causes besides constricted mobility followed by secondary lymphedema could not be identified, and these ulcers were classified as 'inactivity leg ulcers'. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of leg ulcers in patients with RA are due to underlying venous/arterial malfunction while vasculitic or traumatic ulcers are less common. Additionally, we identified a relevant subgroup of patients with 'inactivity ulcers' due to impaired mobility and consecutive lymphedema. Morphology and localization of ulcerations as well as duplex sonography provide the most important clues for accurate diagnosis, ensuring adequate treatment.",M2
20329696,"Low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field--a viable alternative therapy for arthritis.Arthritis refers to more than 100 disorders of the musculoskeletal system. The existing pharmacological interventions for arthritis offer only symptomatic relief and they are not definitive and curative. Magnetic healing has been known from antiquity and it is evolved to the present times with the advent of electromagnetism. The original basis for the trial of this form of therapy is the interaction between the biological systems with the natural magnetic fields. Optimization of the physical window comprising the electromagnetic field generator and signal properties (frequency, intensity, duration, waveform) with the biological window, inclusive of the experimental model, age and stimulus has helped in achieving consistent beneficial results. Low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) can provide noninvasive, safe and easy to apply method to treat pain, inflammation and dysfunctions associated with rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and osteoarthritis (OA) and PEMF has a long term record of safety. This review focusses on the therapeutic application of PEMF in the treatment of these forms of arthritis. The analysis of various studies (animal models of arthritis, cell culture systems and clinical trials) reporting the use of PEMF for arthritis cure has conclusively shown that PEMF not only alleviates the pain in the arthritis condition but it also affords chondroprotection, exerts antiinflammatory action and helps in bone remodeling and this could be developed as a viable alternative for arthritis therapy.",M2
20306616,"Rheumatoid arthritis: coping with disability.This article explains the components of disability as related to rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) using an expansion of Nagi's Model of Disability (Jette, 2006) and the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). In addition, suggestions for ways in which nurses can offer patients choices in physical functional therapy and psychosocial aspects of coping with the chronicity of RA are discussed. Understanding how RA relates to the holistic management of the patient will allow nurses to modify and suggest additional measures to enhance the outcomes of patient-centered care. Many degrees of disability exist that affect the physical and psychosocial domains of RA. Nurses should identify the primary issues influencing disability and assemble supporting resources or a multidisciplinary team to manage a person's disabilities. As nurses develop and maintain relationships with patients, they are able to follow through with the care plan continuum and recognize when modifications are needed.",M2
20305672,"Is interleukin-6 receptor blockade the Holy Grail for inflammatory diseases?Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been linked to a myriad of diseases associated with inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>), Crohn's disease, and several types of cancer. In 2009 the US Food and Drug Administration accepted a complete-response submission for the use of Actemra (tocilizumab), the first humanized IL-6 receptor-inhibiting monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of RA. Although this treatment will certainly help in managing inflammatory disorders such as RA, we suggest that side effects of such blockade may be excess weight gain and hyperlipidemia.",M2
20305562,"Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels, whereas vasculogenesis is de-novo capillary formation from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs). Current understanding of the role of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) and possibilities of therapeutic intervention should be summarized. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been many recent studies on the role of the hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-angiopoietin axis in angiogenesis associated with RA. The role of additional growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, matrix components and adhesion molecules has been further characterized. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) may link inflammation, angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) and focal adhesion kinases (FAKs) have recently been implicated in inflammatory angiogenesis. Novel information regarding the role of serum amyloid A (SAA) and sphingosine kinase has become available. Most of these angiogenic factors have recently been targeted using various techniques and arthritis models. Whereas angiogenesis is abundant in RA, there is defective EPC function and vasculogenesis leading to atherosclerosis and vascular disease in arthritis. Treatment with EPCs already under investigation in vascular diseases may also be attempted in RA. SUMMARY: Targeting angiogenesis and restoration of vasculogenesis may be beneficial for the therapy and outcome of RA.",M2
20305560,"What can we learn from epigenetics in the year 2009?PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) is a systemic, autoimmune disease resulting in the destruction of affected joints. Even though current therapies with biologics such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers yield significant improvement for the patients, the disease is not curable yet. Therefore, we need novel strategies for better therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The growing knowledge of epigenetics might give us new insights into the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In the last year, several new findings about epigenetic modifications of gene expression were reported in different arthritides. These modifications describe changes in the expression of DNA that result from methylation, posttranslational modifications of the histone proteins, including acetylation/deacetylation, sumoylation, methylation and microRNAs. Most interestingly, these modifications seem to act in concert and are associated with the circadian metabolic rhythm of cells. SUMMARY: This review summarizes reports from the last year about epigenetic modifications of gene expression via acetylation/deacetylation, including sirtuins, sumoylation, methylation, microRNAs in all in rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritides, providing potential strategies for better therapies and encourages the development of specific epigenetic drugs.",M2
20301228,"Teaching medical students about chronic disease: patient-led teaching in rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of patient-led teaching compared with doctor-led teaching, regarding the impact of chronic disease (rheumatoid arthritis [<e>RA</e>]). METHODS: A set of learning objectives regarding the impact of RA on patient and family was designed. Students (n = 42) attached to the academy for their musculoskeletal diseases module were randomized to teaching either by a doctor or a patient. Outcome was assessed using a knowledge test, feedback forms and qualitative written interview. RESULTS: In the knowledge test, the groups performed equally. The patient-taught group scored 24.5 +/- 3.5 (max 35); the doctor-taught group scored 24.6 +/- 4.1 (p &gt; 0.05; NS). Feedback was completed by 40/42 students. Mean scores for the overall grading of teaching (1-5, where 1 = worst, 5 = best) were: patient teaching 4.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.11, 4.61); doctor teaching 3.69 (95% CI 3.52, 3.92).The difference between the average scores was 0.42 (p = 0.005). Qualitative feedback showed recurring themes that students appreciated the personal nature of the patient's teaching, enabling them to understand the impact of the disease on patients and their families. The doctors' teaching was also appreciated, particularly the interactive style and opportunity to participate in role play. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that our patient was at least as good as a doctor at teaching about the impact of chronic disease on patients. Furthermore, this experience is valued by students who appreciate the personal insight that a patient can offer.",M2
20299754,"Early ambulation after total knee arthroplasty prevents patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from developing postoperative higher levels of D-dimer.This study aimed to clarify the therapeutic effects of postoperative ambulation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (<e>RA</e>) after TKA. Subjects of this study were thirty-seven inpatients (21 inpatients: OA, 16 inpatients: RA) undergoing TKA (32 female and 5 male). Subjects were divided into two groups, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) group (n=25) and non-DVT group (N group, n=12). The cutoff value was 10.0 microg/ml plasma D-dimer level measured on 7(th) postoperative day. The N group was below the cutoff value. Another cutoff value divided into two groups, ambulatory group (n=26) and non-ambulatory group (n=11). Ambulatory group was the date of ambulation beginning below 7(th) day. Statistical analysis confirmed that all subjects showed a significant correlation to the date of ambulation. Postoperative ambulation beginning had strong association with the level of D-dimer (r=0.71). Group comparison showed that the non-ambulatory group had significant higher values of D-dimer than ambulatory group (P=0.022). Typical case supported these results. Postoperative early ambulation within a week after TKA kept patients with OA and RA after TKA lower level of D-dimer.",M2
