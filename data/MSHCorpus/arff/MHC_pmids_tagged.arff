20359464,"Carbonylation of myosin heavy chains in rat heart during diabetes.Cardiac inotropy progressively declines during diabetes mellitus. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying this defect remain incompletely characterized. This study tests the hypothesis that ventricular myosin heavy chains (<e>MHC</e>) undergo carbonylation by reactive carbonyl species (RCS) during diabetes and these modifications contribute to the inotropic decline. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ). Fourteen days later the animals were divided into two groups: one group was treated with the RCS blocker aminoguanidine for 6 weeks, while the other group received no treatment. After 8 weeks of diabetes, cardiac ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular pressure development (+dP/dt) and myocyte shortening were decreased by 9%, 16%, 34% and 18%, respectively. Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-actomyosin ATPase activities and peak actomyosin syneresis were also reduced by 35%, 28%, and 72%. MHC-alpha to MHC-beta ratio was 12:88. Mass spectrometry and Western blots revealed the presence of carbonyl adducts on MHC-alpha and MHC-beta. Aminoguanidine treatment did not alter MHC composition, but it blunted formation of carbonyl adducts and decreases in actomyosin Ca(2+)-sensitive ATPase activity, syneresis, myocyte shortening, cardiac ejection fraction, fractional shortening and +dP/dt induced by diabetes. From these new data it can be concluded that in addition to isozyme switching, modification of MHC by RCS also contributes to the inotropic decline seen during diabetes.",M1
20347979,"Estradiol and genistein antagonize the ovariectomy effects on skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain expression via ER-beta mediated pathways.The age-related decline in ovarian sex hormone production following the onset of menopause alters skeletal muscle metabolic, structural and functional characteristics. The myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) expression pattern defines skeletal muscle contraction velocity and is therefore an important factor in skeletal muscle function. The present study was designed to examine the effects of 17beta estradiol (E2), estrogen receptor (ER) subtype selective agonists (ERalpha, ERbeta) or genistein (Gen) following ovary removal (OVX) in female Wistar rats in combination with a high intensity treadmill-based exercise protocol (Ex) or normal cage-based activity (NoEx) on MHC protein expression patterns in the slow fiber type m.Soleus (Sol) and the fast fiber type m.Gastrocnemius (Gas). Gen and E2 in the Sol significantly stimulated MHC-I expression relative to OVX only in the absence of exercise (NoEx). MHC-IIb expression in the Gas was significantly increased relative to OVX in Gen Ex and E2 Ex and NoEx groups. The estrogenic effects in the Sol and Gas were both predominantly mediated via ERbeta pathways, since the ERbeta agonist induced greater MHC increases than OVX or ERalpha. We therefore propose that high intensity exercise in combination with exposure to E2, Gen, ERalpha or ERbeta agonists in OVX rats exerts differential effects on MHC expression in skeletal muscles composed of mainly slow type I MHC (Sol) or fast type II MHC (Gas). In summary, the data shows that MHC composition is affected by estrogens and exercise in a fiber type specific manner and that these effects are mainly mediated by ER-beta. This is of great importance with respect to skeletal muscle health and potential treatment with ER selective agonists.",M1
20226094,"Myosin individualized: single nucleotide polymorphisms in energy transduction.BACKGROUND: Myosin performs ATP free energy transduction into mechanical work in the motor domain of the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>). Energy transduction is the definitive systemic feature of the myosin motor performed by coordinating in a time ordered sequence: ATP hydrolysis at the active site, actin affinity modulation at the actin binding site, and the lever-arm rotation of the power stroke. These functions are carried out by several conserved sub-domains within the motor domain. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect the MHC sequence of many isoforms expressed in striated muscle, smooth muscle, and non-muscle tissue. The purpose of this work is to provide a rationale for using SNPs as a functional genomics tool to investigate structurefunction relationships in myosin. In particular, to discover SNP distribution over the conserved sub-domains and surmise what it implies about sub-domain stability and criticality in the energy transduction mechanism. RESULTS: An automated routine identifying human nonsynonymous SNP amino acid missense substitutions for any MHC gene mined the NCBI SNP data base. The routine tested 22 MHC genes coding muscle and non-muscle isoforms and identified 89 missense mutation positions in the motor domain with 10 already implicated in heart disease and another 8 lacking sequence homology with a skeletal MHC isoform for which a crystallographic model is available. The remaining 71 SNP substitutions were found to be distributed over MHC with 22 falling outside identified functional sub-domains and 49 in or very near to myosin sub-domains assigned specific crucial functions in energy transduction. The latter includes the active site, the actin binding site, the rigid lever-arm, and regions facilitating their communication. Most MHC isoforms contained SNPs somewhere in the motor domain. CONCLUSIONS: Several functional-crucial sub-domains are infiltrated by a large number of SNP substitution sites suggesting these domains are engineered by evolution to be too-robust to be disturbed by otherwise intrusive sequence changes. Two functional sub-domains are SNP-free or relatively SNP-deficient but contain many disease implicated mutants. These sub-domains are apparently highly sensitive to any missense substitution suggesting they have failed to evolve a robust sequence paradigm for performing their function.",M1
20201828,"Cyclic mechanical strain promotes transforming-growth-factor-beta1-mediated cardiomyogenic marker expression in bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro.Cardiomyocytes in the heart reside in mechanically dynamic environments, such as those subject to cyclic mechanical strain. TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) stimulates cardiomyogenic marker expression of BMMSCs (bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that cyclic mechanical strain promotes TGF-beta1-mediated cardiomyogenic marker expression in BMMSCs in vitro. The mRNA expression of cardiac-specific genes was more up-regulated in BMMSCs cultured with a TGF-beta1 supplement and subjected to cyclic strain for 1 week than in BMMSCs cultured statically with a TGF-beta1 supplement. Immunocytochemical analyses and flow cytometric analysis showed that the proportions of cardiac troponin-I-positive cells and cardiac <e>MHC</e> (myosin heavy chain)-positive cells and the proportions of cells expressing tropomyosin respectively were increased to a greater extent by TGF-beta1with cyclic strain than by TGF-beta1 alone. These results showed that cyclic strain promotes TGF-beta1mediated cardiomyogenic marker expression in BMMSCs in vitro.",M1
20090419,"Cardiac ventricular chambers are epigenetically   distinguishable.The left and right ventricles are muscular chambers of the heart that differ significantly in the extent of pressure work-load. The regional and differential distribution of gene expression patterns is critical not only for heart development, but, also in the establishment of cardiac hypertrophy phenotypes. the cells of the myocardium employ elaborate regulatory mechanisms to establish changes in chromatin structure and function, yet, the role of epigenetic modifications and specific gene expression patterns in cardiac ventricles remains poorly understood. We have examined gene expression changes and studied histone H3 and H4 acetylation as well as dimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 on promoters of alpha-Myosin heavy chain gene (alpha-<e>MHC</e>), beta-Myosin heavy chain gene (beta-MHC), Atrial natriuretic peptide gene (ANp), B-type natriuretic peptide gene (BNP) and Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase gene (SERCA2a). The recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzyme p300, which is a transcriptional coactivator, was also studied on the hyperacetylated promoters using immunopurification of soluble chromatin in the left and right ventricles of the mouse. We present evidence for the first time that the pattern of gene expression is closely linked with histone modifications and propose the left and right chambers of the heart are epigenetically distinguishable.",M1
20071689,"Passive mechanical forces upregulate the fast myosin heavy chain IId/x via integrin and p38 MAP kinase activation in a primary muscle cell culture.We have studied the mechanism by which a previously described primary muscle culture growing on microcarriers predominantly expresses fast myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) IId/x. We have measured MHC IId/x mRNA and protein levels, mRNA of MHC I and markers of muscle metabolism, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and mechano-growth factor (MGF) transcripts, indicators of the activation of the Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis, the p38-, ERK1/2-, and JNK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathways, and of protein phosphatase PP2A, and we have assessed the involvement of integrin. By placing the culture flasks on a rotary shaker, we induce a continuous motion of the culture medium in which the carrier-myotube aggregates are suspended. This motion exerts passive forces on the myotubes that are decisive for the predominance of MHC II expression. These forces act via integrin, which transduces the mechanical signal into activation of PP2A and of p38 MAP-Kinase. The latter presumably is directly responsible for a drastic upregulation of MHC IId/x, whereas MHC I and metabolic markers remain unaffected. At the same time, despite an elevated level of IGF-1 transcription under passive forces, the IGF-1 receptor-Akt-mTOR axis is switched off as evident from the lack of an effect of inhibition of the IGF-1 receptor and from the PP2A-mediated low degree of phosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1. Similarly, the ERK1/2- and JNK-MAP kinase pathways are repressed. We conclude that passive stretch exerted on the myotubes by the rotary fluid motion induces a rather selective upregulation of fast MHC II, which goes along with a mild muscle hypertrophy as judged from the amount of protein per cell and is caused by p38 MAP kinase activity elevated via integrin sensing. The direct link between passive stretch and MHC II expression constitutes a novel mechanism, which is expected to become effective physiologically under passive stretch and eccentric contractions of skeletal muscles.",M1
20070732,"Blunting effect of hypoxia on the proliferation and differentiation of human primary and rat L6 myoblasts is not counteracted by Epo.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hypoxia and/or erythropoietin would be able to modulate proliferation/differentiation processes of rat and human myoblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat L6 and primary human myoblasts were grown in 21% or 1% O(2) in the presence or absence of recombinant human erythropoietin (RhEpo). Presence of erythropoietin receptors (EpoR) was assayed using RT-PCR and Western blotting techniques. Cell proliferation was evaluated by determining the doubling time and kinetics of cultures by counting cells. Cell differentiation was analysed by determining myogenic fusion index using antibodies against the myosin heavy chain. Expression of myogenin and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) proteins were evaluated using the Western blotting technique. RESULTS: After 96 h culture in growth medium for 2.5 and 9 h, doubling time of L6 and human primary myoblasts respectively, had increased in 1% O(2) conditions (P &lt; 0.01). Kinetics of culture showed alteration in proliferation at 72 h in L6 myoblast cultures and at 4 days in human primary myoblasts. The myogenic fusion index had reduced by 30% in L6 myoblasts and by 20% in human myoblasts (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of myogenin and MHC had reduced by around 50%. Despite presence of EpoR mRNA and protein, RhEpo did not counteract the effects of hypoxia either in L6 cells or in human myoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that exposure to hypoxic conditions (1% O(2)) of rat and human myoblasts altered their proliferation and differentiation processes. They also show that Epo is not an efficient growth factor to counteract this deleterious effect.",M1
20065164,"Rescue of cardiomyopathy in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha transgenic mice by deletion of lipoprotein lipase identifies sources of cardiac lipids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activators.BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence in obesity and diabetes mellitus demonstrates that excessive myocardial fatty acid uptake and oxidation contribute to cardiac dysfunction. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the fatty acid-activated nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (myosin heavy chain [<e>MHC</e>]-PPARalpha mice) exhibit phenotypic features of the diabetic heart, which are rescued by deletion of CD36, a fatty acid transporter, despite persistent activation of PPARalpha gene targets involved in fatty acid oxidation. METHODS AND RESULTS: To further define the source of fatty acid that leads to cardiomyopathy associated with lipid excess, we crossed MHC-PPARalpha mice with mice deficient for cardiac lipoprotein lipase (hsLpLko). MHC-PPARalpha/hsLpLko mice exhibit improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial triglyceride content compared with MHC-PPARalpha mice. Surprisingly, in contrast to MHC-PPARalpha/CD36ko mice, the activity of the cardiac PPARalpha gene regulatory pathway is normalized in MHC-PPARalpha/hsLpLko mice, suggesting that PPARalpha ligand activity exists in the lipoprotein particle. Indeed, LpL mediated hydrolysis of very-low-density lipoprotein activated PPARalpha in cardiac myocytes in culture. The rescue of cardiac function in both models was associated with improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and reactivation of transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: MHC-PPARalpha mouse hearts acquire excess lipoprotein-derived lipids. LpL deficiency rescues myocyte triglyceride accumulation, mitochondrial gene regulatory derangements, and contractile function in MHC-PPARalpha mice. Finally, LpL serves as a source of activating ligand for PPARalpha in the cardiomyocyte.",M1
20060953,"Beta2-adrenergic agonist-induced hypertrophy of the quadriceps skeletal muscle does not modulate disease severity in the rodent meniscectomy model of osteoarthritis.OBJECTIVE: To examine whether beta2-adrenergic agonist-induced hypertrophy of the quadriceps skeletal muscle can modulate the severity of osteoarthritis (OA) in the rodent meniscectomy (MNX) model. METHODS: Male Lewis rats were subcutaneously administered with 1.5 mg/kg/day clenbuterol hydrochloride (n=15) or saline vehicle (n=20) for 14 days. Following pre-treatment, five animals from each group were sacrificed to assess the immediate effects of clenbuterol. The remaining animals underwent either invasive knee surgery (clenbuterol pre-treated n=10; saline pre-treated n=10) or a sham control surgical procedure (saline pre-treated n=5). During disease initiation and progression, weight bearing was assessed by hindlimb loading. Myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) protein isoforms were quantified by silver stained SDS PAGE. OA severity was graded by assessment of toluidine blue stained step coronal sections of the total knee joint. RESULTS: Clenbuterol treatment resulted in an increase in total bodyweight, growth rate and in quadriceps skeletal muscle mass. Meniscal surgery resulted in the development of OA-like lesions, changes to weight bearing, and changes in MHC protein expression in the quadriceps. Clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy had no effect on either weight bearing or articular pathology following MNX surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that clenbuterol-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is unable to mimic the beneficial clinical effects of increased musculature derived through targeted strength training in humans, in a rodent model of MNX-induced OA. In addition we observed fibre-type switching to  slow twitch  in the quadriceps muscle during the induction of OA that warrants further investigation as to its relationship to joint stability.",M1
20056853,"Role(s) of gravitational loading during developing period on the growth of rat soleus muscle fibers.Effects of gravitational loading or unloading on the gain of the characteristics in soleus muscle fibers were studied in rats. The tail suspension was performed in newborn rats from postnatal day 4 to month 3, and the reloading was allowed for 3 mo in some rats. Single expression of type I myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) was observed in approximately 82% of fibers in 3-mo-old controls, but the fibers expressing multiple MHC isoforms were noted in the unloaded rats. Although 97% of fibers in 3-mo-old controls had a single neuromuscular junction at the central region of fiber, fibers with multiple nerve endplates were seen in the unloaded group. Faster contraction speed and lower maximal tension development, even after normalization with fiber size, were observed in the unloaded pure type I MHC fibers. These parameters generally returned to the age-matched control levels after reloading. It was suggested that antigravity-related tonic activity plays an important role in the gain of single neural innervation and of slow contractile properties and phenotype in soleus muscle fibers.",M1

20051642,"Age-related changes in contraction and relaxation of rat diaphragm.Age-related changes of physiological and biochemical properties were examined in the diaphragm muscle, which has particularly high activation compared to that of other skeletal muscles. The diaphragm from 10-week-, 50-week- and 100-week-old male Wistar rats were used to measure in vitro isometric contractile properties, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase activity, and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform composition. Although there were no significant differences in specific twitch tension of the diaphragm among the groups, there was significant reduction in specific tetanic tension in the 50-week to 100-week groups. The contraction time and 1/2 relaxation time of twitch contraction extended with aging, and significant differences were found between 10-week-old and 100-week-old diaphragms. Regarding the activity of SR Ca2+-ATPase, the pattern of age-related change was similar to that in the 1/2 relaxation time and there was a significant difference between 10-week-old and 100-week-old diaphragms. There was a significant increase in the relative composition of the MHC I isoform in 100-week-diaphragms compared to that in 10-week-old diaphragms and a concomitant decrease in the relative composition of fast myosin was noted. These findings demonstrated that older diaphragms have slower contraction and relaxation speeds, and these alterations were attributed to changes in SR Ca2+-ATPase activity and MHC isoform composition.",M1
20051448,"Attenuation of isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis in transgenic rats harboring an angiotensin-(1-7)-producing fusion protein in the heart.OBJECTIVE: It has been shown that Ang-(1-7) has cardioprotective actions. To directly investigate the effects of Ang-(1-7) specifically in the heart, we generated and characterized transgenic (TG) rats which express an Ang-(1-7)-producing fusion protein driven by the alpha-<e>MHC</e> promoter. METHODS AND RESULTS: After microinjection of the transgene into fertilized rat zygotes, we obtained four different transgenic lines. Homozygous animals were analyzed with regard to the expression profile of the transgene by ribonuclease protection assay. Transgene expression was detected mainly in the heart with weak or no expression in other organs. Heterozygous TG(hA-1-7)L7301 rats presented a significant increase in cardiac Ang-(1-7) concentration compared with control rats (17.1+/-2.1 versus 3.9+/-1.4 pg/mg protein in SD rats). Radiotelemetry analysis revealed that TG rats presented no significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate compared with normal rats. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) in the heart produced slight improvement in resting cardiac function (+ dT/dt: 81530+/-1305.0 versus 77470+/-345.5 g/s bpm in SD rats, p &lt; 0.05), which was in keeping with the enhanced [Ca(2+)] handling observed in cardiomyocytes of TG rats. TG(hA-1-7)L7301 rats also showed a greater capacity to withstand stress since TG rats showed a less pronounced deposition of collagen type III and fibronectin induced by isoproterenol treatment in the subendocardial area than in corresponding controls. In addition, hearts from TG rats showed reduced incidence and duration of reperfusion arrhythmias in comparison with SD rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that Ang-(1-7) has blood pressure-independent, antifibrotic effects, acting directly in the heart.",M1
20041489,"Myosin heavy chain isoform profiles remain altered at 7 months if the lacerated medial gastrocnemius is poorly reinnervated: a study in rabbits.Lacerated skeletal muscles often do not recover full function after repair. Denervated muscles with altered myosin heavy chain isoform (<e>MHC</e>) profiles are known to result in functional impairment. We studied the functional recovery of lacerated muscles, assessing MHC profile changes in association to the involvement of the intramuscular nerve (IM). We tested three lacerated models using the rabbit's medial gastrocnemius where the IM was either cut (NNR), repaired (NR), or preserved intact (NP). Muscles were assessed 7 months after repair for muscle atrophy, isometric contraction (by electrical stimulation), and fibrosis formation at the lesion site. Changes in myofibrillar actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase activity, MHC profile, regenerating myofibers and reinnervation were assessed by Western blot, histology, or immunohistology. Lacerated muscles with a repaired (NR) or an intact (NP) IM showed good recovery, with no significant changes in the MHC profile. Muscles where the IM was not repaired (NNR) resulted in significant scar area at the lesion site (p &lt; 0.05), muscle atrophy (67%, p &lt; 0.05) and loss in contractile properties (63% of the uninjured side, p &lt; 0.05). At 7 months, all muscles were reinnervated. However, the NNR had an inappropriate (polyneural) and poorly distributed reinnervation, the presence of regenerating myofibers, and demonstrated a fast-to-slow MHC transition (71%:29% to 44%:56%, ANOVA, p = 0.018). This was associated to the cut IM when the NNR muscle was lacerated. Poor reinnervation in lacerated skeletal muscles alters the myosin heavy chain profile permanently. This study provides a rationale to also consider biological solutions to improve nerve regeneration and reinnervation in the surgical repair of lacerated muscles.",M1
20032385,"Voluntary wheel running in rats receiving doxorubicin: effects on running activity and cardiac myosin heavy chain.BACKGROUND: The clinical use of the highly effective chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. This cardiotoxicity is associated with a cardiac myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform shift from the alpha isoform to the beta isoform. Exercise prior to DOX treatment has been shown to attenuate the MHC shift associated with DOX, but little is known about the cardioprotective nature of exercise during DOX treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DOX-treated rats were assigned to normal cage activity (sedentary, SED+DOX) or 24-hour voluntary wheel running access (WR+DOX). All animals received weekly 2.5 mg/kg DOX injections for 6 weeks (15 mg/kg cumulative) and hearts were subsequently excised for determination of MHC isoform expression using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: At baseline, WR+DOX rats on average ran 62+/-4 km, and at week 6 ran 30+/-5 km, which was significantly lower than baseline (p&lt;0.05). SED+DOX hearts expressed 57+/-7% of MHC as the alpha-MHC isoform and 43+/-7% as the beta-MHC isoform. WR+DOX hearts expressed 76+/-4% as the alpha-MHC and 24+/-4% as the beta-MHC isoform, which was significantly different from that of SED+DOX (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: DOX treatment significantly reduced wheel running activity, but this reduced running distance deemed to be cardioprotective as hearts from WR+DOX rats contained significantly greater levels of the favorable alpha-MHC isoform than SED+DOX.",M1
19967157,"Megakaryocyte and platelet abnormalities in a patient with a W33C mutation in the conserved SH3-like domain of myosin heavy chain IIA.Heterozygous mutations in MYH9, which encodes non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (<e>MHC</e>-IIA), result in autosomal dominant inherited MYH9-related disorders characterised by macro-thrombocytopenia, granulocyte inclusions, variable sensorineural deafness, cataracts and nephritis. MHC-IIA is assembled into a complex consisting of two pairs of light chains and two heavy chains, where the latter contain a neck region, SH3-like, motor and rod domains. We describe a patient with a Trp33Cys missense mutation in the SH3-like domain of MHC-IIA. Abnormal platelet function was observed using platelet aggregometry with the agonists epinephrine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Patient granulocytes and megakaryocytes, but not platelets, contained abnormal MHC-IIA inclusions visualised by confocal immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Megakaryocytes grown in culture were smaller and contained hypolobulated nuclei compared to controls. Bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes revealed a preponderance of immature forms, the presence of structurally diverse inclusion bodies, and frequent emperipolesis as assessed by electron microscopy. Platelets and leukocytes contained indistinguishable amounts of total MHC-IIA determined by immunoblotting. Molecular modelling studies indicated that mutation of Trp33 destabilises the interface between the SH3-like and motor domain of MHC-IIA, which is close to previously described motor domain mutations, implying an important structural and/or functional role for this region in MHC-IIA.",M1
19937450,"Effects of strength training with eccentric overload on muscle adaptation in male athletes.In classic concentric/eccentric exercise, the same absolute load is applied in concentric and eccentric actions, which infers a smaller relative eccentric load. We compared the effects of 6 weeks of classic concentric/eccentric quadriceps strength training (CON/ECC, 11 subjects) to eccentric overload training (CON/ECC+, 14 subjects) in athletes accustomed to regular strength training. The parameters determined included functional tests, quadriceps and fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), fibre type distribution by ATPase staining, localisation of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform mRNAs by situ hybridization and the steady-state levels of 48 marker mRNAs (RT-PCR) in vastus lateralis biopsies taken before and after training. Both training forms had anabolic effects with significant increases in quadriceps CSA, maximal strength, ribosomal RNA content and the levels of mRNAs involved in growth and regeneration. Only the CON/ECC+ training led to significantly increased height in a squat jump test. This was accompanied by significant increases in IIX fibre CSA, in the percentage of type IIA fibres expressing MHC IIx mRNA, in the level of mRNAs preferentially expressed in fast, glycolytic fibres, and in post-exercise capillary lactate. The enhanced eccentric load apparently led to a subtly faster gene expression pattern and induced a shift towards a faster muscle phenotype plus associated adaptations that make a muscle better suited for fast, explosive movements.",M1
19907120,"Unique contractile and structural protein expression in dog ileal inner circular smooth muscle.This study was designed to test the hypothesis that there is heterogeneous expression of contractile and structural proteins between the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the inner and outer circular muscle (ICM and OCM) layers of the ileum. Immunohistochemical staining and quantitation of fresh frozen sections of the dog ileum was performed using protein specific antibodies. Smooth muscle (SM) SMA myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>), alpha- and gamma-SM actin, and vinculin all show greater expression in the ICM relative to the OCM. SMB MHC and fibronectin show the opposite pattern, with greater expression in the OCM relative to the ICM. Differences in expression of these proteins are consistent with proposed differences in function of these muscle layers. Hypotheses regarding muscle tone and the coordination and regulation of peristalsis via these different muscle layers based on this data can now be made and tested.",M1
19884322,"Myosin heavy chain isoform composition and Ca(2+) transients in fibres from enzymatically dissociated murine soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles.Electrically elicited Ca(2+) transients reported with the fast Ca(2+) dye MagFluo-4 AM and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) electrophoretic patterns were obtained in intact, enzymatically dissociated fibres from adult mice extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles. Thirty nine fibres (23 from soleus and 16 from EDL) were analysed by both fluorescence microscopy and electrophoresis. These fibres were grouped as follows: group 1 included 13 type I and 4 type IC fibres; group 2 included 2 type IIC, 3 IIA and 1 I/IIA/IIX fibres; group 3 included 4 type IIX and 1 type IIX/IIB fibres; group 4 included 2 type IIB/IIX and 9 type IIB fibres. Ca(2+) transients obtained in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 had the following kinetic parameters (mean +/- s.e.m.): amplitude (F/F): 0.61 +/- 0.05, 0.53 +/- 0.08, 0.61 +/- 0.06 and 0.61 +/- 0.03; rise time (ms): 1.64 +/- 0.05, 1.35 +/- 0.05, 1.18 +/- 0.06 and 1.14 +/- 0.04; half-amplitude width (ms): 19.12 +/- 1.85, 11.86 +/- 3.03, 4.62 +/- 0.31 and 4.23 +/- 0.37; and time constants of decay (tau(1) and tau(2), ms): 3.33 +/- 0.13 and 52.48 +/- 3.93, 2.69 +/- 0.22 and 41.06 +/- 9.13, 1.74 +/- 0.06 and 12.88 +/- 1.93, and 1.56 +/- 0.11 and 9.45 +/- 1.03, respectively. The statistical differences between the four groups and the analysis of the distribution of the parameters of Ca(2+) release and clearance show that there is a continuum from slow to fast, that parallels the MHC continuum from pure type I to pure IIB. However, type IIA fibres behave more like IIX and IIB fibres regarding Ca(2+) release but closer to type I fibres regarding Ca(2+) clearance. In conclusion, we show for the first time the diversity of Ca(2+) transients for the whole continuum of fibre types and correlate this functional diversity with the structural and biochemical diversity of the skeletal muscle fibres.",M1
19854200,"Effects of myosin heavy chain manipulation in experimental heart failure.The myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoforms, alpha- and beta-MHC, are expressed in developmental- and chamber-specific patterns. Healthy human ventricle contains approximately 2-10% alpha-MHC and these levels are reduced even further in the failing ventricle. While down-regulation of alpha-MHC in failing myocardium is considered compensatory, we previously demonstrated that persistent transgenic (TG) alpha-MHC expression in the cardiomyocytes is cardioprotective in rabbits with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC). We sought to determine if this benefit extends to other types of experimental heart failure and focused on two models relevant to human heart failure: myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular pressure overload. TG and nontransgenic rabbits underwent either coronary artery ligation at 8 months or aortic banding at 10 days of age. The effects of alpha-MHC expression were assessed at molecular, histological and organ levels. In the MI experiments, we unexpectedly found modest functional advantages to alpha-MHC expression. In contrast, despite subtle benefits in TG rabbits subjected to aortic banding, cardiac function was minimally affected. We conclude that the benefits of persistent alpha-MHC expression depend upon the mechanism of heart failure. Importantly, in none of the scenarios studied did we find any detrimental effects associated with persistent alpha-MHC expression. Thus manipulation of MHC composition may be beneficial in certain types of heart failure and does not appear to compromise heart function in others. Future considerations of myosin isoform manipulation as a therapeutic strategy should consider the underlying etiology of cardiac dysfunction.",M1
19826309,"Effects of different intensities of resistance exercise on regulators of myogenesis.A single bout of high-intensity resistance exercise is capable of activating the expression of various genes in skeletal muscle involved in hypertrophy such as myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoforms, myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), and growth factors. However, the specific role exercise intensity plays on the expression of these genes is not well defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise intensity on MHC (type I, IIA, IIX), MRF (Myo-D, myogenin, MRF-4, myf5), and growth factor (insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-1, IGF-1 receptor [IGF-R1], mechano-growth factor [MGF]) mRNA expression. Thirteen male participants (21.5 +/- 2.9 years, 86.1 +/- 19.5 kg, 69.7 +/- 2.7 in.) completed bouts of resistance exercise involving 4 sets of 18-20 repetitions with 60-65% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and 4 sets of 8-10 repetitions with 80-85% 1RM. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained immediately before exercise, and at 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 6 hours after each bout. The levels of mRNA expression were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed using 2 x 4 multivariate analysis of variance (p &lt;or= 0.05). For both intensities, MHC type IIX, IGF-1, IGF-R1, MGF, Myo-D, myogenin, MRF-4, and myf5 mRNA were all significantly increased in response to resistance exercise by 2 hours after exercise, whereas myostatin and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip) were decreased at 2 hours after exercise (p &lt; 0.05). Resistance exercise between 60-85% 1RM upregulates the mRNA expression of MHC and factors involved in myogenic activation of satellite cells while concomitantly decreasing expression of myogenic inhibitors.",M1
19826181,"Thyroid hormone at supra-physiological dose optimizes cardiac geometry and improves cardiac function in rats with old myocardial infarction.Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling. Acute myocardial infarction was induced in male Wistar rats by ligating left coronary artery (AMI, n=8), while sham operated animals served as control (SHAM, n=8). 13 weeks after AMI, TH was administered in a group of animals for 4 weeks (AMI-THYR, n=9). TH significantly increased beta-<e>MHC</e> and decreased alpha-MHC expression in the myocardium. This response was accompanied by changes in cardiac geometry: sphericity index, (SI, long to short axis ratio) was found to be 1.95 (SEM, 0.02) in SHAM, 1.51(0.03) in AMI and 1.64(0.03) in AMI-THYR, p&lt;0.05. As a consequence, cardiac function was significantly improved: left ventricular ejection fraction (EF%) was 74.5% (SEM, 2.8) in SHAM vs 29.5% (2.1) in AMI, and 40.0% in AMI-THYR, p&lt;0.05. Furthermore, +dp/dt and -dp/dt were 4250 (127) and 2278 (55) in SHAM vs 2737(233) and 1508 (95) in AMI vs 3866 (310) and 2137(111) in AMI -THYR, respectively, p&lt;0.05. TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure.",M1
19816211,"Effects of creatine supplementation during resistance training on myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) expression in rat skeletal muscle fibers.The purpose of this study was to utilize a rodent model to test the hypothesis that creatine (Cr) supplementation during resistance training would influence the pattern of slow-twitch muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms expression. Male Wistar rats (2-3 months old, 250-300 g) were divided into 4 groups: Nontrained without creatine supplementation (CO), nontrained with creatine supplementation (CR), trained without creatine supplementation (TR), and trained with creatine supplementation (TRCR). TR and TRCR groups were submitted to a resistance training program for 5 weeks (5 days/week) for morphological and biochemical analysis of the soleus muscle. Weightlifting exercise involved jump sessions into water, carrying progressive overload equivalent to percentage of body weight. CR and TRCR groups were given creatine at 0.5 g/kg(-1)/d(-1). Both Cr supplementation and resistance training alone or associated did not result in significant alterations (p &gt; 0.05) in body weight gain, food intake, and muscle weight in the CR, TR and TRCR groups compared to the CO group. Also compared to the CO group, the CR group showed a significant (p &lt; 0.02) increase in MHCI content and a reduction in MHCII; inversely, the TR group increased the MHCII content and reduced MHCI (p &lt; 0.02). When combined, both creatine and resistance training did not promote significant (p &gt; 0.05) changes in MHC content of the TRCR group compared to the CO group. The data show that Cr supplementation provides a potential action to abolish the exercise-induced MHC isoform transitions from slow to fast in slow-twitch muscle. Thus, Cr supplementation might be a suitable strategy to maintaining a slow phenotype in slow muscle during resistance training, which may be favorable to maintenance of muscle oxidative capacity of endurance athletes.",M1
19808357,"Effects of cardiac myosin isoform variation on myofilament function and crossbridge kinetics in transgenic rabbits.BACKGROUND: The left ventricles of both rabbits and humans express predominantly beta-myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>). Transgenic (TG) rabbits expressing 40% alpha-MHC are protected against tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, but the normal amount of alpha-MHC expressed in humans is only 5% to 7% and its functional importance is questionable. This study was undertaken to identify a myofilament-based mechanism underlying tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy protection and to extrapolate the impact of MHC isoform variation on myofilament function in human hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Papillary muscle strips from TG rabbits expressing 40% (TG40) and 15% alpha-MHC (TG15) and from nontransgenic (NTG) controls expressing approximately 100% beta-MHC (NTG40 and NTG15) were demembranated and calcium activated. Myofilament tension and calcium sensitivity were similar in TGs and respective NTGs. Force-clamp measurements revealed approximately 50% higher power production in TG40 versus NTG40 (P&lt;0.001) and approximately 20% higher power in TG15 versus NTG15 (P&lt;0.05). A characteristic of acto-myosin crossbridge kinetics, the  dip  frequency, was significantly higher in TG40 versus NTG40 (0.70+/-0.04 versus 0.39+/-0.09 Hz, P&lt;0.01) but not in TG15 versus NTG15. The calculated crossbridge time-on was also significantly shorter in TG40 (102.3+/-14.2 ms) versus NTG40 (175.7+/-19.7 ms) but not in TG15 versus NTG15. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of 40% alpha-MHC leads to greater myofilament power production and more rapid crossbridge cycling, which facilitate ejection and relengthening during short cycle intervals, and thus protect against tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Our results suggest, however, that, even when compared with the virtual absence of alpha-MHC in the failing heart, the 5% to 7% alpha-MHC content of the normal human heart has little if any functional significance.",M1
19808346,"Physiological replacement of T3 improves left ventricular function in an animal model of myocardial infarction-induced congestive heart failure.BACKGROUND: Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) often have low serum triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations. In a rodent model of myocardial infarction-induced CHF and low serum T(3), we hypothesized that replacing T(3) to euthyroid levels would improve left ventricular function without producing untoward signs of thyrotoxicosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation (myocardial infarction). One week post-myocardial infarction, left ventricular fractional shortening was significantly reduced to 22+/-1% in CHF animals versus 38+/-1% for sham-operated controls (P&lt;0.001). Serum T(3) concentration was also significantly reduced (80+/-3 versus 103+/-6 ng/dL; P&lt;0.001), in CHF animals versus Shams. At 9 weeks post-myocardial infarction, systolic function (+dP/dt max) was significantly attenuated in CHF animals (4773+/-259 versus 6310+/-267 mmHg/s; P&lt;0.001) as well as diastolic function measured by half time to relaxation (15.9+/-1.2 versus 11.1+/-0.3 ms; P&lt;0.001). alpha-myosin heavy chain expression was also significantly reduced by 77% (P&lt;0.001), and beta-myosin heavy chain expression was increased by 21%. Continuous T(3) replacement was initiated 1 week post-myocardial infarction with osmotic mini-pumps (6 microg/kg/d), which returned serum T(3) concentrations to levels similar to Sham controls while resting conscious heart rate, arterial blood pressure and the incidence of arrhythmias were not different. At 9 weeks, systolic function was significantly improved by T(3) replacement (6279+/-347 mmHg/s; P&lt;0.05) and a trend toward improved diastolic function (12.3+/-0.6 ms) was noted. T(3) replacement in CHF animals also significantly increased alpha- and reduced beta-<e>MHC</e> expression, (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression.",M1
19773579,"USP19-deubiquitinating enzyme regulates levels of major myofibrillar proteins in L6 muscle cells.The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in the degradation of myofibrillar proteins that occurs in muscle wasting. Many studies have demonstrated the importance of enzymes mediating conjugation of ubiquitin. However, little is known about the role of deubiquitinating enzymes. We previously showed that the USP19-deubiquitinating enzyme is induced in atrophying skeletal muscle (Combaret L, Adegoke OA, Bedard N, Baracos V, Attaix D, Wing SS. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 288: E693-E700, 2005). To further explore the role of USP19, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) in L6 muscle cells. Lowering USP19 by 70-90% in myotubes resulted in a 20% decrease in the rate of proteolysis and an 18% decrease in the rate of protein synthesis, with no net change in protein content. Despite the decrease in overall synthesis, there were approximately 1.5-fold increases in protein levels of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>), actin, and troponin T and a approximately 2.5-fold increase in tropomyosin. USP19 depletion also increased MHC and tropomyosin mRNA levels, suggesting that this effect is due to increased transcription. Consistent with this, USP19 depletion increased myogenin protein and mRNA levels approximately twofold. Lowering myogenin using siRNA prevented the increase in MHC and tropomyosin upon USP19 depletion, indicating that myogenin mediated the increase in myofibrillar proteins. Dexamethasone treatment lowered MHC and increased USP19. Depletion of USP19 reversed the dexamethasone suppression of MHC. These studies demonstrate that USP19 modulates transcription of major myofibrillar proteins and indicate that the ubiquitin system not only mediates the increased protein breakdown but is also involved in the decreased protein synthesis in atrophying skeletal muscle.",M1
19768738,"Myosin heavy chain composition of tiger (Panthera tigris) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) hindlimb muscles.Felids have a wide range of locomotor activity patterns and maximal running speeds, including the very fast cheetah (Acinonyx jubatas), the roaming tiger (Panthera tigris), and the relatively sedentary domestic cat (Felis catus). As previous studies have suggested a relationship between the amount and type of activity and the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform composition of a muscle, we assessed the MHC isoform composition of selected hindlimb muscles from these three felid species with differing activity regimens. Using gel electrophoresis, western blotting, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry with MHC isoform-specific antibodies, we compared the MHC composition in the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius (MG), plantaris (Plt), and soleus muscles of the tiger, cheetah, and domestic cat. The soleus muscle was absent in the cheetah. At least one slow (type I) and three fast (types IIa, IIx, and IIb) MHC isoforms were present in the muscles of each felid. The tiger had a high combined percentage of the characteristically slower isoforms (MHCs I and IIa) in the MG (62%) and the Plt (86%), whereas these percentages were relatively low in the MG (44%) and Plt (55%) of the cheetah. In general, the MHC isoform characteristics of the hindlimb muscles matched the daily activity patterns of these felids: the tiger has daily demands for covering long distances, whereas the cheetah has requirements for speed and power.",M1
19756706,"Hypoxic training increases metabolic enzyme activity and composition of alpha-myosin heavy chain isoform in rat ventricular myocardium.Cardiac muscle adaptation is essential for maintaining physical capacity after ascending to high altitude. This study examines the effects of high altitude training on myocardial metabolic enzyme activity and composition of alpha-myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>). Rats were randomly divided into normobaric sedentary (NS) and training (NT) groups, and hypobaric sedentary (HS) and training (HT) groups. HS and HT rats were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (simulated 4,000-5,000 m) for 5 weeks (24 h/day), and HT rats simultaneously received swim training. Hypoxia exposure for 5 weeks led to a decrease in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and citrate synthase (CS) activities in the left ventricle (LV), and a decrease in CS, hexokinase (HK) and total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in the right ventricle (RV) (p &lt; 0.05, HS vs. NS). Furthermore, 1 h/day swim training during hypoxia exposure enhanced the CS activity in LV and the SDH and CS activities in RV (p &lt; 0.05, HT vs. HS). The percentages of alpha-MHC in both ventricles in HT were higher than those in HS (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that exercise training at high altitude is beneficial for cardiac muscle adaptation to hypoxia by increasing activities of enzymes and percentage of alpha-MHC. This may contribute to improved cardiac function and work capacity at high altitude.",M1
19752118,"Differences in sodium voltage-gated channel properties according to myosin heavy chain isoform expression in single muscle fibres.The myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform determines the characteristics and shortening velocity of muscle fibres. The functional properties of the muscle fibre are also conditioned by its membrane excitability through the electrophysiological properties of sodium voltage-gated channels. Macropatch-clamp is used to study sodium channels in fibres from peroneus longus (PL) and soleus (Sol) muscles (Wistar rats, n = 8). After patch-clamp recordings, single fibres are identified by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis according to their myosin heavy chain isoform (slow type I and the three fast types IIa, IIx, IIb). Characteristics of sodium currents are compared (Student's t test) between fibres exhibiting only one MHC isoform. Four MHC isoforms are identified in PL and only type I in Sol single fibres. In PL, maximal sodium current (I(max)), maximal sodium conductance (g(Na,max)) and time constants of activation and inactivation ((m) and (h)) increase according to the scheme I--&gt;IIa--&gt;IIx--&gt;IIb (P &lt; 0.05). (m) values related to sodium channel type and/or function, are similar in Sol I and PL IIb fibres (P = 0.97) despite different contractile properties. The voltage dependence of activation (V(a,1/2)) shows a shift towards positive potentials from Sol type I to IIa, IIx and finally IIb fibres from PL (P &lt; 0.05). These data are consistent with the earlier recruitment of slow fibres in a fast-mixed muscle like PL, while slow fibres of postural muscle such as soleus could be recruited in the same ways as IIb fibres in a fast muscle.",M1
19715808,"Carbamylated erythropoietin protects the myocardium from acute ischemia/reperfusion injury through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin (EPO) and carbamylated erythropoietin (CEPO) can protect tissue from injury; however, CEPO has its protective effect in the absence of erythropoietic stimulation. The mechanism whereby CEPO protects heart from acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. METHODS: BALB/c mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 4 h, and they received a single dose of CEPO intraperitoneal at the onset of reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size and cardiac function were assessed. The association of erythropoietin receptor with beta common receptor (betacR) was examined. The level of Akt phosphorylation in the myocardium was assayed as well as a series of downstream target genes of PI3K/Akt,including p-GATA-4, GATA-4, <e>MHC</e>, and troponin I. RESULTS: CEPO administration immediately before reperfusion decreased infarction by 40% and increased ejection fraction (27%) and fractional shortening (22%), compared with untreated ischemic hearts (P &lt; .05 each). CEPO promoted association of the EPO receptor and betacR. Furthermore, CEPO administration increased the levels of phospho-Akt in the myocardium by 59% (P &lt; .05). A PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked the beneficial effect of CEPO on infarct size and cardiac function and attenuated the CEPO-induced Akt phosphorylation. CEPO also increased the expression of p-GATA-4, GATA-4, myosin heavy chain, and troponin I. CONCLUSION: A single dose of CEPO at the onset of reperfusion attenuated acute myocardial I/R injury in the mouse. CEPO-induced cardioprotection appears to be mediated through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.",M1
19713680,"Angiotensin II induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy probably through histone deacetylases.Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a pathophysiological role in the genesis of cardiac hypertrophy as a hypertrophic stimulus. But little is known about the terminal steps, in which Ang II reprograms cardiac gene expression. Histone deacetyltransferases (HDACs) are considered as the integrators of divergent stress-response pathways during heart remodeling. However, the exact role of HDACs in the hypertrophic process is not clear yet. Therefore, we studied the expression of HDAC2, one of Class I HDACs, and the effect of valproic acid (VPA), a nonspecific HDAC inhibitor, in the Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1-day-old Wistar rats and treated with Ang II. The mRNA levels of HDAC2 and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-<e>MHC</e>), a hypertrophic marker gene, were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression of HDAC2 and c-fos, an immediate early response gene, was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the surface areas of cardiomyocytes were measured using Motic Images software. The expression levels of HDAC2 mRNA and protein were increased in a time-dependent manner during the hypertrophic process, accompanied with the increment of beta-MHC and c-fos proteins. Ang II also increased the surface area of cardiomyocytes by more than twofold. VPA significantly reversed these changes. These results suggest that Ang II may induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through HDACs in combination with c-fos and that VPA has the protective effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, HDAC inhibition is a feasible therapeutic strategy that holds promise in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.",M1
19690046,"Evidence of MyomiR network regulation of beta-myosin heavy chain gene expression during skeletal muscle atrophy.There is a growing recognition that noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. A class of small (19-22 nt) ncRNAs, known as microRNAs (miRs), have received a great deal of attention lately because of their ability to repress gene expression through a unique posttranscriptional 3'-untranslated region (UTR) mechanism. The objectives of the current study were to identify miRs expressed in the rat soleus muscle and determine if their expression was changed in response to hindlimb suspension. Comprehensive profiling revealed 151 miRs were expressed in the soleus muscle and expression of 18 miRs were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) changed after 2 and/or 7 days of hindlimb suspension. The significant decrease (16%) in expression of muscle-specific miR-499 in response to hindlimb suspension was confirmed by RT-PCR and suggested activation of the recently proposed miR encoded by myosin gene (MyomiR) network during atrophy. Further analysis of soleus muscle subjected to hindlimb suspension for 28 days provided evidence consistent with MyomiR network repression of beta-myosin heavy chain gene (beta-<e>MHC</e>) expression. The significant downregulation of network components miR-499 and miR-208b by 40 and 60%, respectively, was associated with increased expression of Sox6 (2.2-fold) and Purbeta (23%), predicted target genes of miR-499 and known repressors of beta-MHC expression. A Sox6 3'-UTR reporter gene confirmed Sox6 is a target gene of miR-499. These results further expand the role of miRs in adult skeletal muscle and are consistent with a model in which the MyomiR network regulates slow myosin expression during muscle atrophy.",M1
19684280,"Examination of myosin heavy chain isoform expression in ovine skeletal muscles.The contractile and associated metabolic characteristics of muscles are determined by their myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform expression. In large mammals, the level of MHCIIB expression, which is associated with fast glycolytic-type muscle fibers, has not been fully characterized. In this study, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and SDS-PAGE methodologies were developed for the analyses of adult ovine MHC isoform expression and used to characterize MHC expression in 3 skeletal muscles [LM, semitendinosus, and supraspinatus) from 66-d-old lambs. Three MHC isoforms (MHCI, MHCIIA, and MHCIIX) were detected at both the protein and messenger RNA levels in all 3 muscles, with greater proportions of type II than type I MHC. The expression of MHCIIB could not be detected at the protein level in any of the muscles and was detectable (in semitendinosus muscle) only at the messenger RNA level by using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, indicating that MHCIIX is the predominant fast glycolytic fiber type in the sheep muscles studied. The methodologies developed are suitable for studying fiber type transformations at the molecular level, as well as allowing analyses of very small samples, including biopsies, when histochemical analysis may not be possible.",M1
19684093,"The CAAT-binding transcription factor 1/nuclear factor 1 binding site is important in beta-myosin heavy chain antisense promoter regulation in rats.The rat heart expresses two myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoforms, beta and alpha; these genes are arranged in tandem on the same chromosome. We have reported that an antisense (AS) beta RNA starts in the intergenic (IG) region between beta and alpha genes and extends to overlap the beta gene. We propose that in adult rats, both the alpha sense and IG betaAS RNA expression are activated by an IG bidirectional promoter and that the transcription of betaAS RNA interferes with the sense beta, resulting in low levels of beta mRNA and high levels of alpha, a phenotype seen in a typical rat heart. A previous report examined the activity of the betaAS promoter and showed that a 559 bp fragment of the betaAS promoter (-2285 to -1726; relative to alphaMHC gene start site) injected into rat ventricle was activated in control heart, and decreased significantly in response to hypothyroidism (propylthiouracil induced) and diabetes (streptozotocin induced) and increased in hyperthyroid rats (T(3) induced), similar in pattern to the endogenous betaAS RNA. In the present paper, we demonstrate with electrophoretic mobility shift analyses that ventricular nuclear proteins are interacting with a nuclear factor 1/CAAT-binding transcription factor 1 (NF1/CTF1) binding site, and a supershift assay indicates that the protein binding at this site is antigenetically related to the CTF1/NF1 factor. Moreover, a mutation of the CTF1/NF1 site within the 559 bp promoter region nearly abolished promoter activity in vivo in control, STZ- and PTU-treated rats. Based on these findings, we conclude that the NF1 site is critical to betaAS promoter regulation.",M1
19657098,"Calcineurin plays a modulatory role in loading-induced regulation of type I myosin heavy chain gene expression in slow skeletal muscle.The role of calcineurin (Cn) in skeletal muscle fiber-type expression has been a subject of great interest because of reports indicating that it controls the slow muscle phenotype. To delineate the role of Cn in phenotype remodeling, particularly its role in driving expression of the type I myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) gene, we used a novel strategy whereby a profound transition from fast to slow fiber type is induced and examined in the absence and presence of cyclosporin A (CsA), a Cn inhibitor. To induce the fast-to-slow transition, we first subjected rats to 7 days of hindlimb suspension (HS) + thyroid hormone [triiodothyronine (T(3))] to suppress nearly all expression of type I MHC mRNA in the soleus muscle. HS + T(3) was then withdrawn, and rats resumed normal ambulation and thyroid state, during which vehicle or CsA (30 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) was administered for 7 or 14 days. The findings demonstrate that, despite significant inhibition of Cn, pre-mRNA, mRNA, and protein abundance of type I MHC increased markedly during reloading relative to HS + T(3) (P &lt; 0.05). Type I MHC expression was, however, attenuated by CsA compared with vehicle treatment. In addition, type IIa and IIx MHC pre-mRNA, mRNA, and relative protein levels were increased in Cn-treated compared with vehicle-treated rats. These findings indicate that Cn has a modulatory role in MHC transcription, rather than a role as a primary regulator of slow MHC gene expression.",M1
19633204,"Dimethylthiourea normalizes velocity-dependent, but not force-dependent, index of ventricular performance in diabetic rats: role of myosin heavy chain isozyme.Hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide are involved in the pathogenesis of systolic dysfunction in diabetic rats, but the precise mechanisms and the effect of antioxidant therapy in diabetic subjects have not been elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the effects of dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger, on both force-dependent and velocity-dependent indexes of cardiac contractility in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced early and chronic diabetic rats. Seventy-two hours and 8 wk after STZ (55 mg/kg) injection, diabetic rats were randomized to either DMTU (50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) ip) or vehicle treatment for 6 and 12 wk, respectively. All rats were then subjected to invasive hemodynamic studies. Maximal systolic elastance (E(max)) and maximum theoretical flow (Q(max)) were assessed by curve-fitting techniques in terms of the elastance-resistance model. Both normalized E(max) (E(maxn)) and afterload-adjusted Q(max) (Q(maxad)) were depressed in diabetic rats, concomitant with altered myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform composition and its upstream regulators, such as myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) and heart autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives (HAND). In chronic diabetic rats, DMTU markedly attenuated the impairment in Q(maxad) and normalized the expression of MEF-2 and eHAND and MHC isoform composition but exerted an insignificant benefit on E(maxn). Regarding preventive treatment, DMTU significantly ameliorated both E(maxn) and Q(maxad) in early diabetic rats. In conclusion, our study shows that DMTU has disparate effects on Q(maxad) and E(maxn) in chronic diabetic rats. The advantage of DMTU in chronic diabetic rats might involve normalization of MEF-2 and eHAND, as well as reversal of MHC isoform switch.",M1
19628726,"Rapid muscle atrophy response to unloading: pretranslational processes involving <e>MHC</e> and actin.Skeletal muscles, especially weight-bearing muscles, are very sensitive to changes in loading state. The aim of this paper was to characterize the dynamic changes in the unloaded soleus muscle in vivo following a short bout of hindlimb suspension (HS), testing the hypothesis that transcriptional events respond early to the atrophic stimulus. In fact, we observed that after only 1 day of HS, primary transcript levels of skeletal alpha-actin and type I myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes were significantly reduced by more than 50% compared with ground control levels. The degree of the decline for the mRNA expression of actin and type I MHC lagged behind that of the pre-mRNA levels after 1 day of HS, but by 2 and 7 days of HS, large decreases were observed. Although the faster MHC isoforms, IIx and IIb, began to be expressed in soleus after 1 day of HS, a relatively significant shift in mRNA expression from the slow MHC isoform type I toward these fast MHC isoforms did not emerge until 7 days of HS. One day of HS was sufficient to show significant decreases in mRNA levels of putative signaling factors serum response factor (SRF), suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), and striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS), although transcription factors yin-yang-1 (YY1) and transcriptional enhancing factor-1 (TEF-1) were not significantly affected by HS. The protein levels of actin and type I MHC were significantly decreased after 2 days of HS, and SRF protein was significantly decreased after 7 days HS. Our results show that after only 1 day of unloading, pre-mRNA and mRNA expression of muscle proteins and muscle-specific signaling factors are significantly reduced, suggesting that the downregulation of the synthesis side of the protein balance equation that occurs in atrophying muscle is initiated rapidly.",M1
19625607,"Different roles of H-ras for regulation of myosin heavy chain promoters in satellite cell-derived muscle cell culture during proliferation and differentiation.The effect of constitutively activated proto-oncogene H-ras (H-rasQ61L) on the regulation of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) promoter activities was investigated in rabbit satellite cell-derived muscle cell culture during the proliferation stage and early and later stages of differentiation, respectively. During proliferation, overexpression of H-rasQ61L did not affect basal level of activity of the slow MHCI/beta or the fast MHCIId/x promoter luciferase reporter gene construct in transient transfection assays. By contrast, H-rasQ61L affected both MHC promoter activities during differentiation, and this effect changes from inactivation after 2 days to activation after 4 days of differentiation. The activating effect of H-rasQ61L on both MHC promoters after 4 days of differentiation was significantly reduced by LY-294002, a specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream target of Ras. Furthermore, the protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B), a downstream target of PI3k, was activated 4 days after initiation of differentiation in myotubes overexpressing H-rasQ61L. By contrast, inhibition of another Ras downstream pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (MKK1/2-ERK1/2-MAPK), increased activities of both MHC promoters, indicating a suppressive role of this pathway. Moreover, the Ras-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the activation of MHCI/beta and IId/x promoters in a later stage of differentiation of muscle cells, presumably by a known inhibiting effect of activated Akt on the MKK1/2-ERK1/2-MAPK pathway. The experiments demonstrate that during differentiation of muscle cells activated H-ras is an important regulator of MHC isoform promoter function with opposite effects during early and later stages.",M1
19625080,"Skeletal muscle tissue engineering: a maturation model promoting long-term survival of myotubes, structural development of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus and neonatal myosin heavy chain expression.The use of defined in vitro systems to study the developmental and physiological characteristics of a variety of cell types is increasing, due in large part to their ease of integration with tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and high-throughput screening applications. In this study, myotubes derived from fetal rat hind limbs were induced to develop several aspects of mature muscle including: sarcomere assembly, development of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) class switching. Utilizing immunocytochemical analysis, anisotropic and isotropic band formation (striations) within the myotubes was established, indicative of sarcomere formation. In addition, clusters of ryanodine receptors were colocalized with dihydropyridine complex proteins which signaled development of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus and transverse tubule biogenesis. The myotubes also exhibited MHC class switching from embryonic to neonatal MHC. Lastly, the myotubes survived significantly longer in culture (70-90 days) than myotubes from our previously developed system (20-25 days). These results were achieved by modifying the culture timeline as well as the development of a new medium formulation. This defined model system for skeletal muscle maturation supports the goal of developing physiologically relevant muscle constructs for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as well as for high-throughput screening applications.",M1
19623632,"Transcriptional regulation of the myosin heavy chain IIb gene in inactive rat soleus.The myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform composition of skeletal muscle is dependent, in part, on the functional demands of the muscle. The rat soleus muscle primarily expresses the slow-contracting type I MHC; however, chronic inactivity increases expression of the faster-contracting type II MHC isoforms. The purpose of this study was to identify the type IIb MHC promoter region(s) that regulate de novo transcription during chronic inactivity of the soleus induced by spinal cord isolation (SI; complete mid-thoracic and high sacral spinal cord transections plus deafferentation). Seven days after SI, transcription of IIb MHC was evidenced by increases in IIb pre-mRNA and mRNA. The activity of an approximately 2.2-kb IIb promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid increased in SI soleus over control as compared to that of a promoterless plasmid. Deletion analyses indicated that the regions encompassing -2237 to -1431, -1048 to -461, and -192 to -161 basepairs (bp) each contributed to the increase in transcriptional activity. Moreover, deletions or mutations of AT-rich regions in the proximal -192 bp region abolished the increased promoter activity. These results provide important insights related to how proximal IIb MHC promoter elements regulate the increased expression of the IIb MHC gene in response to inactivity of a predominantly slow postural muscle as it undergoes a remodeling of its phenotype and functional characteristics.",M1
19571576,"Effects of pathological flow on pulmonary artery endothelial production of vasoactive mediators and growth factors.BACKGROUND: Alterations in pulmonary blood flow are often associated with the initiation and progression of pulmonary vascular disease. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in mediating flow effects in the pulmonary circulation remain unclear. Depending on the disease condition, flow may be extremely low or high. We therefore examined effects of pathologically low and high flow on endothelial production of factors capable of affecting pulmonary vascular tone and structure as well as on potential underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Flow effects on pulmonary endothelial release of NO, PGF(1a), ET-1 and TxB(2), on expression of total and phosphorylated eNOS as well as Akt, and on VEGF were examined. Additionally, in a coculture system, effects of flow-exposed endothelial cells on smooth muscle (SM) proliferation and contractile protein were studied. RESULTS: Compared to physiological flow, pathologically high and low flow attenuated endothelial release of NO and PGF(1a), and enhanced release of ET-1. Physiological flow activated the Akt/eNOS pathway, while pathological flow depressed it. Pathologically high flow altered VE-cadherin expression. Pathologically high flow on the endothelium upregulated alpha-SM-actin and SM-<e>MHC</e> without affecting SM proliferation. CONCLUSION: Physiological flow leads to production of mediators which favor vasodilation. Pathological flow alters the balance of mediator production which favors vasoconstriction.",M1
19553028,"Myosin heavy chain proteins are responsible for the development of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.We introduce a hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is primarily caused by an inherited reduced adaptability of upper airway striated muscles such that they cannot maintain patency when there is reduced consciousness (sleep). This reduced ability is caused by a deficiency of the genes for specific myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) proteins, which are the primary source of muscle adaptability in adults and were initially described in the chewing muscles. The development of OSAS must be linked to problems with striated muscle because affected patients are capable of normal breathing when awake but their respiratory parameters deteriorate during sleep; OSAS must, therefore, be caused by a factor that is voluntarily active during waking but inactive during sleep, and this can only be striated muscle. Congenital or acquired anatomical abnormalities are involved only partially, because OSAS patients with anatomical abnormalities do not begin to snore or to have apneas or hypopneas when lying in bed awake, but begin to do so only when sleeping.",M1
19534295,"Wavelet-based analysis of surface mechanomyographic signals from subjects with differences in myosin heavy chain isoform content.The purpose of this study was to use a wavelet analysis designed specifically for surface mechanomyographic (MMG) signals to determine if the % myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform content affected the shape of the MMG frequency spectrum during isometric muscle actions. Five resistance-trained (mean +/- SD age = 23.2 +/-3.7 yrs), five aerobically-trained (mean +/- SD age = 32.6 +/- 5.2 yrs), and five sedentary (mean +/- SD age = 23.4 +/- 4.1 yrs) men performed isometric muscle actions of the dominant leg extensors at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Surface MMG signals were detected from the vastus lateralis during each muscle action and processed with the MMG wavelet analysis. In addition, muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis and analyzed for % MHC isoform content. The results showed that there were distinct differences among the three groups of subjects for % MHC isoform content. These differences were not manifested, however, in the isometric force-related changes in the total intensity of the MMG signal in each wavelet band. It is possible that factors such as the thicknesses of the subcutaneous adipose tissue and/or iliotibial band reduced the potential influence of differences in % MHC isoform content on the MMG signal.",M1
19504066,"Cell-type-specific transgenesis in the mouse.Since the early 1980s, when the first transgenic mice were generated, thousands of genetically modified mouse lines have been created. Early on, Jaenisch established proof of principle, showing that viral integration into the mouse genome and germline transmission of those exogenous sequences were possible (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 71:1250-1254, 1974). Gordon et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 77:7380-7384, 1980) and Brinster et al. (Cell 27:223-231, 1981) subsequently used cloned genes to create  transgenic constructs  in which the exogenous DNA was randomly inserted into different sites in the mouse genome, stably maintained, and transmitted through the germline to the progeny. The utility of the process quickly became apparent when a transgene carrying the metallothionein-1 (Mt-1) promoter linked to thymidine kinase was able to drive expression in the mouse liver when promoter activity was induced by administration of metals. In an attempt to find stronger and more reliable promoters, viral promoter elements from SV40 or cytomegalovirus were incorporated. However, while these promoters were able to drive high levels of expression, for many applications they proved to be too blunt an instrument as they drove ubiquitous expression in many, if not all cell types, making it very hard to discern organ-specific or cell-type-specific effects due to transgene expression. Thus the need to find cell-type-specific promoters that could reproducibly drive high levels of transgene expression in a particular cell type, e.g., cardiomyocyte, became apparent. One such example is the alpha myosin heavy-chain (<e>MHC</e>) promoter, which has been used extensively to drive transgene expression in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner in the mouse. This chapter, while not written as a typical methods section, will describe the necessary components of the alpha myosin promoter. In addition, common problems associated with transgenic mouse lines will be addressed.",M1
19452634,"Stimulus specific changes of energy metabolism in hypertrophied heart.Cardiac energy metabolism is a determinant of the response to hypertrophic stimuli. To investigate how it responds to physiological or pathological stimuli, we compared the energetic status in models of hypertrophy induced by physiological stimuli (pregnancy or treadmill running) and by pathological stimulus (spontaneously hypertensive rats, SHR) in 15 week-old female rats, leading to a 10% cardiac hypertrophy. Late stage of compensated hypertrophy was also studied in 25 week-old SHR (35% of hypertrophy). Markers of cardiac remodelling did not follow a unique pattern of expression: in trained rats, only ANF was increased; in gravid rats, calcineurin activation and BNP expression were reduced while beta-<e>MHC</e> expression was enhanced; all markers were clearly up-regulated in 25 week-old SHR. Respiration of permeabilized fibers revealed a 17% increase in oxidative capacity in trained rats only. Mitochondrial enzyme activities, expression of the master regulator PGC-1alpha and mitochondrial transcription factor A, and content of mitochondrial DNA were not consistently changed, suggesting that compensated hypertrophy does not involve alterations of mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial fatty acid utilization tended to increase in trained rats and decreased by 14% in 15 week-old SHR. Expression of markers of lipid oxidation, PPARalpha and its down-stream targets MCAD and CPTI, was up-regulated after training and tended to decrease in gravid and 15 week-old SHR rats. Taken together these results show that there is no univocal pattern of cardiac adaptation in response to physiological or pathological hypertrophic stimuli, suggesting that other factors could play a role in determining adaptation of energy metabolism to increased workload.",M1
19413380,"Effects of ovariectomy on rat genioglossal muscle contractile properties and fiber-type distribution.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that ovariectomy has no effects on contractile, histochemical, or biochemical properties of the rat genioglossus (GG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three groups: normal group (Normal), sham-operated group (Sham), and ovariectomized group (OVX). Four weeks later, genioglossal electromyography activity (EMGgg) and contractile properties were measured, including relative integrated EMG (iEMG), maximal twitch tension, 70%-decay time, and fatigue index (FI). Then rats were sacrificed and paired GG were removed for further analysis. Adenosine-triphosphatase (ATPase) staining was performed to determine the percent fiber-type distribution and to identify cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle fibers. Myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) phenotypes were determined by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Ovariectomy reduced EMG activity and contractile properties of the GG. Following ovariectomy, the CSA of type IIA and the proportion of MHCIIA decreased significantly. The MHC isoform composition of GG transferred from relative slow-twitch to fast-twitch isoform, following the order MHCIIB --&gt; MHCIIX --&gt; MHCIIA. Sham operation had no effect on any of the parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis is rejected. The contractile properties of the GG are sensitive to ovariectomy. These changes were, at least in part, associated with changes in the amount and type of contractile protein expressed.",M1
19407247,"Decreased muscle ACE activity enhances functional response to endurance training in rats, without change in muscle oxidative capacity or contractile phenotype.In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic ANG I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition could improve the training-induced improvement in endurance exercise performance and that this could be related to enhanced skeletal muscle metabolic efficiency. Female Wistar rats were assigned to four groups comprising animals either maintained sedentary or endurance trained (Sed and Tr, respectively), and treated or not for 10 wk with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) (Per and Ct, respectively) (n = 8 each). Trained rats underwent an 8-wk treadmill training protocol that consisted of 2 h/day running at 30 m/min on a 8% decline. Before the start of and 1 wk before the end of experimental conditioning, the running time to exhaustion of rats was measured on a treadmill. The training program led to an increase in endurance time, higher in Tr-Per than in Tr-Ct group (125% in Tr-Ct vs. 183% in Tr-Per groups, P &lt; 0.05). Oxidative capacity, measured in saponin-permeabilized fibers of slow soleus and fast plantaris muscles, increased with training, but less in Tr-Per than in Tr-Ct rats. The training-induced increase in citrate synthase activity also was less in soleus from Tr-Per than Tr-Ct rats. The training-induced increase in the percentage of the type IIa isoform of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) (45%, P &lt; 0.05) and type IIx MHC (25%, P &lt; 0.05) associated with decreased type IIb MHC (34%, P &lt; 0.05) was minimized by perindopril administration. These findings demonstrate that the enhancement in physical performance observed in perindopril-treated animals cannot be explained by changes in mitochondrial respiration and/or MHC distribution within muscles involved in running exercise.",M1
19404753,"Altered fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibre characteristics in female mice with a (S248F) knock-in mutation of the brain neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.We generated a mouse line with a missense mutation (S248F) in the gene (CHRNA4) encoding the alpha4 subunit of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Mutant mice demonstrate brief nicotine induced dystonia that resembles the clinical events seen in patients with the same mutation. Drug-induced dystonia is more pronounced in female mice, thus our aim was to determine if the S248F mutation changed the properties of fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibres from female mutant mice. Reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed CHRNA4 gene expression in the brain but not skeletal muscles in normal and mutant mice. Ca(2+) and Sr(2+) force activation curves were obtained using skinned muscle fibres prepared from slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (EDL) muscles. Two significant results were found: (1) the (pCa(50) - pSr(50)) value from EDL fibres was smaller in mutant mice than in wild type (1.01 vs. 1.30), (2) the percentage force produced at pSr 5.5 was larger in mutants than in wild type (5.76 vs. 0.24%). Both results indicate a shift to slow-twitch characteristics in the mutant. This conclusion is supported by the identification of the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoforms. Mutant EDL fibres expressed MHC I (usually only found in slow-twitch fibres) as well as MHC IIa. Despite the lack of spontaneous dystonic events, our findings suggest that mutant mice may be having subclinical events or the mutation results in a chronic alteration to muscle neural input.",M1
19395549,"Determination of rate constants for turnover of myosin isoforms in rat myocardium: implications for in vivo contractile kinetics.The ventricles of small mammals express mostly alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-<e>MHC</e>), a fast isoform, whereas the ventricles of large mammals, including humans, express approximately 10% alpha-MHC on a predominately beta-MHC (slow isoform) background. In failing human ventricles, the amount of alpha-MHC is dramatically reduced, leading to the hypothesis that even small amounts of alpha-MHC on a predominately beta-MHC background confer significantly higher rates of force development in healthy ventricles. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to determine the fundamental rate constants of cross-bridge attachment (f(app)) and detachment (g(app)) for myosins composed of 100% alpha-MHC or beta-MHC, which can then be used to calculate twitch time courses for muscles expressing variable ratios of MHC isoforms. In the present study, rat skinned trabeculae expressing either 100% alpha-MHC or 100% beta-MHC were used to measure ATPase activity, isometric force, and the rate constant of force redevelopment (k(tr)) in solutions of varying Ca(2+) concentrations. The rate of ATP utilization was approximately 2.5-fold higher in preparations expressing 100% alpha-MHC compared with those expressing only beta-MHC, whereas k(tr) was 2-fold faster in the alpha-MHC myocardium. From these variables, we calculated f(app) to be approximately threefold higher for alpha-MHC than beta-MHC and g(app) to be twofold higher in alpha-MHC. Mathematical modeling of isometric twitches predicted that small increases in alpha-MHC significantly increased the rate of force development. These results suggest that low-level expression of alpha-MHC has significant effects on contraction kinetics.",M1
19382057,"MMG-EMG cross spectrum and muscle fiber type.The purpose of this study was to investigate fiber type-related differences in the patterns of responses for mechanomyographic-electromyographic (MMG-EMG) cross spectrum mean power frequency (MPF) in resistance-trained and aerobically-trained subjects during a fatiguing muscle action. Five resistance-trained and five aerobically-trained men performed a 45-s isometric muscle action of the dominant leg extensors at 50% MVC while MMG and EMG signals were recorded simultaneously from the vastus lateralis muscle. In addition, a biopsy was taken to determine the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform content of the vastus lateralis. The resistance-trained and aerobically-trained subjects demonstrated similar patterns of responses for MMG-EMG cross spectrum MPF during the sustained muscle action. The vastus lateralis of the resistance-trained subjects demonstrated primarily Type II MHC isoform expression, indicative of fast-twitch muscle fibers, while that of the aerobically-trained subjects was composed mostly of Type I MHC isoform expression, indicative of slow-twitch fibers. Thus, the differences in fiber type characteristics were not manifested in the patterns of responses for MMG-EMG cross spectrum MPF.",M1
19369448,"Differential epigenetic modifications of histones at the myosin heavy chain genes in fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers and in response to muscle unloading.Recent advances in chromatin biology have enhanced our understanding of gene regulation. It is now widely appreciated that gene regulation is dependent upon post-translational modifications to the histones which package genes in the nucleus of cells. Active genes are known to be associated with acetylation of histones (H3ac) and trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we examined histone modifications at the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) genes expressed in fast vs. slow fiber-type skeletal muscle, and in a model of muscle unloading, which results in a shift to fast MHC gene expression in slow muscles. Both H3ac and H3K4me3 varied directly with the transcriptional activity of the MHC genes in fast fiber-type plantaris and slow fiber-type soleus. During MHC transitions with muscle unloading, histone H3 at the type I MHC becomes de-acetylated in correspondence with down-regulation of that gene, while upregulation of the fast type IIx and IIb MHCs occurs in conjunction with enhanced H3ac in those MHCs. Enrichment of H3K4me3 is also increased at the type IIx and IIb MHCs when these genes are induced with muscle unloading. Downregulation of IIa MHC, however, was not associated with corresponding loss of H3ac or H3K4me3. These observations demonstrate the feasibility of using the ChIP assay to understand the native chromatin environment in adult skeletal muscle, and also suggest that the transcriptional state of types I, IIx and IIb MHC genes are sensitive to histone modifications both in different muscle fiber-types and in response to altered loading states.",M1
19340546,"Significant roles of microtubules in mature striated muscle deduced from the correlation between tubulin and its molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin in rat muscles.To elucidate the significance of cytoskeletal microtubule networks in striated muscles, we analyzed correlation between the content of tubulin (building block of microtubules) and alphaB-crystallin (a molecular chaperone for tubulin) in a variety of striated muscles expressing different myosin heavy-chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoforms. The content of both tubulin and alphaB-crystallin was larger in MHC-I dominant soleus muscle and in MHC-alpha dominant cardiac (atrium and ventricle) muscles; intermediate in MHC-IId dominant masseter, tongue, and diaphragm muscles; and smaller in MHC-IIb dominant plantaris, gastrocnemius, psoas, extensor digitorum longus, and tibialis anterior muscles. Since the muscles of slow-type MHC (MHC-I/alpha) show the most economical features in their function and metabolism, which suit for continuous activity required to sustain posture and blood pumping, the present results afforded additional support to our hypothesis that microtubule networks transduce mechanical environmental demands to morphological and biochemical responses that eventually evolve adaptive transformation in the function and metabolism of the mature muscles. The comparison of tubulin/alphaB-crystalline ratios across the muscles of varied MHC isoforms further suggested that mechanical stress fluctuating at the rhythmic frequency of walking and breathing efficiently activates the hypothesized dynamic function of microtubules.",M1
19322778,"Mapping of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine modification sites in key contractile proteins of rat skeletal muscle.O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a widespread modification of serine/threonine residues of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Recently, several key contractile proteins in rat skeletal muscle (i.e., myosin heavy and light chains and actin) were identified as O-GlcNAc modified. Moreover, it was demonstrated that O-GlcNAc moieties involved in contractile protein interactions could modulate Ca(2+) activation parameters of contraction. In order to better understand how O-GlcNAc can modulate the contractile activity of muscle fibers, we decided to identify the sites of O-GlcNAc modification in purified contractile protein homogenates. Using an MS-based method that relies on mild beta-elimination followed by Michael addition of DTT (BEMAD), we determined the localization of one O-GlcNAc site in the subdomain four of actin and four O-GlcNAc sites in the light meromyosin region of myosin heavy chains (<e>MHC</e>). According to previous reports concerning the role of these regions, our data suggest that O-GlcNAc sites might modulate the actin-tropomyosin interaction, and be involved in MHC polymerization or interactions between MHC and other contractile proteins. Thus, the results suggest that this PTM might be involved in protein-protein interactions but could also modulate the contractile properties of skeletal muscle.",M1
19319827,"In vitro cardiomyogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stromal cells using transforming growth factor-beta1.Transplanting stem cells differentiated towards a cardiac lineage can regenerate cardiac muscle tissues to treat myocardial infarction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) induces cardiomyogenic differentiation of adipose- derived stromal cells (ADSCs) in vitro. Rat ADSCs were cultured with TGF-beta1 (10 ng ml(-1)) for 2 weeks in vitro. ADSCs cultured without TGF-beta1 served as a control. The mRNA expression of cardiac-specific gene was induced by TGF-beta1, while the control culture did not show cardiac-specific gene expression. Immunocytochemical analyses showed that a small fraction of ADSCs cultured with TGF-beta1 for 2 weeks stained positively for cardiac myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) and alpha-sarcomeric actin. Flow cytometric analyses showed that the proportion of cells expressing cardiac MHC increased with TGF-beta1. However, no mesenchymal differentiation (e.g., osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation) was detected other than cardiomyogenic differentiation. These results showed that TGF-beta1 induce ADSC cardiomyogenic differentiation in vitro, which could be useful for myocardial infarction stem cell therapy.",M1
19294446,"The metabolic modulators, Etomoxir and NVP-LAB121, fail to reverse pressure overload induced heart failure in vivo.Shifting substrate oxidation in heart muscle from fatty acids to glucose (substrate-switch) may improve contractile function in heart failure. We tested whether application of two agents (etomoxir and NVP-LAB121) capable of inducing a substrate-switch reverts the onset of heart failure in rats with chronic pressure-overload. Hypertrophy was induced by aortic banding in rats for 1 or 15 weeks. Rats were treated for 10 days with the CPT-1-inhibitor etomoxir [29.5 micromol/(kg day)] or with NVP-LAB121 [60 micromol/(kg day)], a pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-inhibitor, before assessment by echocardiography and perfusion as isolated working hearts. We also analyzed PDH- and CPT1-activity and expression of alpha- and beta-<e>MHC</e> by RT-PCR. Aortic banding increased heart-to-body-weight-ratio (g/kg) from 3.44 +/- 0.26 to 4.14 +/- 0.48 after 1 week and from 2.80 +/- 0.21 to 6.54 +/- 0.26 after 15 weeks. Ejection fraction was impaired after 15 weeks (57 +/- 11 vs. 73 +/- 8%, P &lt; 0.05) and rats exhibited signs of heart failure. Total PDH activity was the same in all groups. CPT-1 activity was unchanged after 1 week but decreased after 15 weeks (P &lt; 0.01). Neither etomoxir nor NVP-LAB121 affected cardiac function in vivo, but etomoxir improved function of the isolated heart. The drugs did not affect total PDH and CPT-1 activity, but increased PDH-activity status, prevented a decrease in PDK4 expression in heart failure, increased alpha and beta-MHC expression and shifted substrate oxidation toward glucose in the isolated working rat heart. In conclusion, pharmacologic induction of substrate-switching is associated with changes in myofibrillar isoform expression but does not reverse heart failure in vivo. The improvement of function in vitro deserves further investigation.",M1
19288153,"Time course and mechanisms of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension.Although pulmonary hypertension (PH) selectively overloads the right ventricle (RV), neuroendocrine activation and intrinsic myocardial dysfunction have been described in the left ventricle (LV). In order to establish the timing of LV dysfunction development in PH and to clarify underlying molecular changes, Wistar rats were studied 4 and 6 weeks after subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (MCT) 60 mg/kg (MCT-4, n = 11; MCT-6, n = 11) or vehicle (Ctrl-4, n = 11; Ctrl-6, n = 11). Acute single beat stepwise increases of systolic pressure were performed from baseline to isovolumetric (LVPiso). This hemodynamic stress was used to detect early changes in LV performance. Neurohumoral activation was evaluated by measuring angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) LV mRNA levels. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Extracellular matrix composition was evaluated by tenascin-C mRNA levels and interstitial collagen content. Myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) composition of the LV was studied by protein quantification. MCT treatment increased RV pressures and RV/LV weight ratio, without changing LV end-diastolic pressures or dimensions. Baseline LV dysfunction were present only in MCT-6 rats. Afterload elevations prolonged tau and upward-shifted end-diastolic pressure dimension relations in MCT-4 and even more in MCT-6. MHC-isoform switch, ACE upregulation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were present in both MCT groups. Rats with severe PH develop LV dysfunction associated with ET-1 and tenascin-C overexpression. Diastolic dysfunction, however, could be elicited at earlier stages in response to hemodynamic stress, when only LV molecular changes, such as MHC isoform switch, ACE upregulation, and myocardial apoptosis were present.",M1
19282494,"Changes in efficiency and myosin expression in the small-muscle phenotype of mice selectively bred for high voluntary running activity.Mice from lines selectively bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running express a high incidence of a small muscle phenotype ('mini-muscles') that may confer an adaptive advantage with respect to endurance-running capacity. Plantar flexors in the mini-muscle phenotype exhibit a high capacity for aerobic activity, including altered enzyme activities, loss of expression of type IIb myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>), increased expression of type I, IIx and IIa MHC, and mechanical performance consistent with slower, more fatigue-resistant muscles. We hypothesized that these changes may accompany enhanced efficiency of contraction, perhaps in support of the enhanced capacity for endurance running. To assess efficiency, we measured work and associated oxygen consumption from isolated soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles from mice with mini-muscle and normal phenotypes. We also measured the MHC expression of the plantar flexor muscles to better understand the physiological basis of any differences in efficiency. The proportion of the various MHC isoforms in the soleus was shifted toward a slightly faster phenotype in the mini-muscle mice, whereas in the gastrocnemius and plantaris it was shifted toward a markedly slower phenotype, with large reductions in type IIb MHC and large increases in type I, IIa, and IIx MHC. Soleus muscles from normal and mini-muscle mice showed no statistical differences in efficiency, but medial gastrocnemius from mini-muscle mice were significantly less efficient than those from normal mice, despite the distinctly slower MHC phenotype in mini-muscle mice. Thus, based on measures of efficiency from isolated muscles under conditions near optimal for power output, the shift toward a slower phenotype in 'mini' gastrocnemius muscles does not appear to confer advantages directly through increased efficiency. Rather, the slower phenotype may reduce energy used by the muscles and be permissive to enhanced running ability, perhaps by reducing reliance on anaerobic metabolism.",M1
19266390,"Hemiparetic stroke alters vastus lateralis myosin heavy chain profiles between the paretic and nonparetic muscles.Skeletal muscle phenotype alterations following hemiparetic stroke contribute to disabilities associated with stroke. The phenotypic response following stroke is undefined. This investigation examined the myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) composition of the vastus lateralis (VL) of stroke survivors in paretic (P) and nonparetic (NP) muscle. Protein obtained from VL of 10 stroke survivors was isolated and purified, and MHC gel electrophoresis was performed. The MHC bands were quantified, and a paired sample two-tailed T test with significance set at p &lt; or = 0.05 was performed. MHC I expression was significantly less in P versus NP VL (.93 vs. 1.00 arbitrary units [AU]). Significantly more IIx MHC was found in the P versus NP VL (1.33 vs. 1.0). No significant differences in type IIa MHC (1.07 P vs. 1.00 NP) were found. These changes in MHC composition suggest an alteration in muscle function due to stroke or the altered activity patterns of muscle following stroke.",M1
19260067,"Botulinum toxin-induced paralysis leads to slower myosin heavy chain isoform composition and reduced titin content in juvenile rat gastrocnemius muscle.Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin A (Btx-A) and exercise are used in the treatment of muscle spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. However, little is known about the biological changes within muscle subsequent to Btx-A-induced paralysis and how the combination of Btx-A and exercise might affect the growing muscle. The wet mass, myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) composition, and titin content of the juvenile rat gastrocnemius muscle were determined 3 weeks after Btx-A injections and subsequent voluntary wheel-running exercise. Btx-A increased the proportion of type IIa (+121%) and IIx (+65%) MHC while decreasing the proportion of type IIb MHC (-51%) and reducing the titin content (-18%). Exercise did not amplify or reduce the changes induced by Btx-A. Thus, we conclude that although the sarcomeric stability of paralyzed muscle might be impaired, moderate mechanical loading does not seem to affect paralyzed muscle protein composition.",M1
19251841,"Modulation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype in hypoxia: role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase and myocardin.We have previously reported that in ovine fetal pulmonary venous smooth muscle cells (FPVSMC), decreased expression of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) by hypoxia could explain hypoxia-induced SMC phenotype modulation. In this study, we investigated the role of myocardin, a possible downstream effector of PKG, in SMC phenotype modulation induced by 1 and 24 h of hypoxia. Hypoxia for 1 h induced the phosphorylation of E-26-like protein 1 (Elk-1), indicating a quick activation of Elk-1 after hypoxia. Either hypoxia (1 h) or treatment with DT-3, a PKG inhibitor, increased associations of Elk-1 with myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) gene and serum response factor (SRF), which was paralleled by a decrease in association of myocardin with MHC gene and SRF. Exposure to hypoxia of FPVSMC for 24 h significantly decreased the promoter activity of multiple SMC marker genes, downregulated protein and mRNA expression of myocardin, and upregulated mRNA expression of Elk-1, but had no significant effects on the phosphorylation of Elk-1. Inhibition of myocardin by siRNA transfection downregulated the expression of SMC marker proteins, while overexpression of myocardin prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in expression of SMC marker proteins. Inhibition of PKG by siRNA transfection downregulated the expression of myocardin, but upregulated that of Elk-1. Overexpression of PKG prevented hypoxia-induced effects on protein expression of myocardin and Elk-1. These data suggest that PKG induces displacement of myocardin from SRF and upregulates myocardin expression, thus activating the SMC genes transcription. The inhibitory effects of hypoxia on PKG may explain hypoxia-induced SMC phenotype modulation by decreasing the effects of PKG on myocardin.",M1
19246651,"Improvements in whole muscle and myocellular function are limited with high-intensity resistance training in octogenarian women.Advanced sarcopenia is prevalent among octogenarian women; yet little is known about myocellular quality and plasticity in this cohort. The aim of this investigation was to examine single muscle fiber contractile function and whole muscle characteristics before and after 12 wk of high-intensity progressive resistance training (PRT) in very old (85 +/- 1 yr) women (OW, n = 6). Young women [YW (21 +/- 2 yr old), n = 9] were included as a control group. Whole muscle strength [1 repetition maximum (RM)] and size (CT scans) were assessed before and after PRT. Functional experiments (size, peak force, velocity, and power) were performed on vastus lateralis myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) I and IIa muscle fibers before and after PRT. With PRT, 1-RM strength increased (P &lt; 0.05) in YW (36%) and OW (26%). Thigh muscle cross-sectional area increased (5%) in YW (P &lt; 0.05), but thigh muscle did not hypertrophy in OW. Before PRT, there were no differences in single-fiber parameters between YW and OW. With PRT, MHC IIa fiber size (28%), peak force (31%), and power (28%) improved, but no changes were observed in MHC I fibers, in YW (P &lt; 0.05). There were no improvements in MHC I or IIa single-fiber function in OW. These data show that the myocellular functional profile in OW is similar to that in YW but that OW have a blunted hypertrophic response to PRT at the whole muscle and myocellular level. The limited myocellular plasticity in OW with PRT contrasts with that in YW and previous PRT studies in elderly women only a decade younger. These data suggest that attempts to greatly enhance skeletal muscle mass and function should begin before 80 yr of age.",M1
19234575,"Role of oxidative stress in ischemia-reperfusion-induced alterations in myofibrillar ATPase activities and gene expression in the heart.Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in the heart has been shown to produce myofibrillar remodeling and depress Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments; however, the mechanisms for these alterations are not clearly understood. In view of the role of oxidative stress in cardiac dysfunction due to IR, isolated rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia for 30 min followed by a 30-minute period of reperfusion. IR was found to induce cardiac dysfunction, as reflected by depressed LVDP, +dP/dt, and -dP/dt, and elevated LVEDP, and to reduce myofibrillar Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity. These changes were simulated by perfusing the hearts with a mixture of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase, which is known to generate oxyradicals. The alterations in cardiac function and myofibrillar Ca2+-stimulated ATPase in IR hearts were attenuated by pretreatment with antioxidants (superoxide dismutase plus catalase, and N-acetylcysteine) and leupeptin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent protease. The levels of mRNA for myosin heavy chain isoforms (alpha-<e>MHC</e> and beta-MHC) and myosin light chain (MLC1) were depressed in IR hearts. These changes in gene expression due to IR were prevented upon perfusing the hearts with superoxide plus catalase, with N-acetylcysteine, or with leupeptin. The results suggest that oxidative stress due to IR injury and associated proteolysis play an important role in inducing changes in myofibrillar Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity and gene expression in the heart.",M1
19218519,"Skeletal muscle fiber types in the ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata: implications for running performance.Ghost crabs possess rapid running capabilities, which make them good candidates for comparing invertebrate exercise physiology with that of more extensively studied vertebrates. While a number of studies have examined various aspects of running physiology and biomechanics in terrestrial crabs, none to date have defined the basic skeletal muscle fiber types that power locomotion. In the current study, we investigated skeletal muscle fiber types comprising the extensor and flexor carpopodite muscles in relation to running performance in the ghost crab. We used kinematic analyses to determine stride frequency and muscle shortening velocity and found that both parameters are similar to those of comparably sized mammals but slower than those observed in running lizards. Using several complementary methods, we found that the muscles are divided into two primary fiber types: those of the proximal and distal regions possess long sarcomeres (6.2+/-2.3 microm) observed in crustacean slow fibers and have characteristics of aerobic fibers whereas those of the muscle mid-region have short sarcomeres (3.5+/-0.4 microm) characteristic of fast fibers and appear to be glycolytic. Each fiber type is characterized by several different myofibrillar protein isoforms including multiple isoforms of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>), troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT) and a crustacean fast muscle protein, P75. Three different isoforms of MHC are differentially expressed in the muscles, with fibers of the mid-region always co-expressing two isoforms at a 1:1 ratio within single fibers. Based on our analyses, we propose that these muscles are functionally divided into a two-geared system, with the aerobic fibers used for slow sustained activities and the glycolytic mid-region fibers being reserved for explosive sprints. Finally, we identified subtle differences in myofibrillar isoform expression correlated with crab body size, which changes by several orders of magnitude during an animal's lifetime.",M1
19205846,"Induction of muscle weakness by local inflammation: an experimental animal model.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The objective of this study was to characterize the response of skeletal muscle to a localized inflammation induced by the inflammatory agent casein. METHODS: An inflammatory agent, casein, was injected into the right hindlimb and saline was injected into the left hindlimb of normal adult mice, once daily for six consecutive days. Inflammatory response was monitored by immunohistochemical labeling of leukocytes. Muscle protein levels were determined by electrophoresis and muscle function was determined by isometric force measurements. RESULTS: Local inflammation was induced by casein in association with the accumulation of extensive neutrophils and macrophages in the soleus muscle. This local inflammation resulted in a shift in myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform expression and a significant reduction in total MHC concentration in the soleus. Maximal twitch and tetanic forces were significantly reduced in the inflamed soleus. Contractile function in soleus was fully restored after two weeks of recovery, along with the restoration of protein concentration and the disappearance of inflammatory cells. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a unique and robust model in which mechanisms of local inflammation induced muscle protein degradation, reduction of contractile force, and subsequent recovery from this condition can be further studied.",M1
19196911,"Strength training combined with plyometric jumps in adults: sex differences in fat-bone axis adaptations.Leptin and osteocalcin play a role in the regulation of the fat-bone axis and may be altered by exercise. To determine whether osteocalcin reduces fat mass in humans fed ad libitum and if there is a sex dimorphism in the serum osteocalcin and leptin responses to strength training, we studied 43 male (age 23.9 2.4 yr, mean +/- SD) and 23 female physical education students (age 23.2 +/- 2.7 yr). Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: training (TG) and control (CG). TG followed a strength combined with plyometric jumps training program during 9 wk, whereas the CG did not train. Physical fitness, body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and serum concentrations of hormones were determined pre- and posttraining. In the whole group of subjects (pretraining), the serum concentration of osteocalcin was positively correlated (r = 0.29-0.42, P &lt; 0.05) with whole body and regional bone mineral content, lean mass, dynamic strength, and serum-free testosterone concentration (r = 0.32). However, osteocalcin was negatively correlated with leptin concentration (r = -0.37), fat mass (r = -0.31), and the percent body fat (r = -0.44). Both sexes experienced similar relative improvements in performance, lean mass (+4-5%), and whole body (+0.78%) and lumbar spine bone mineral content (+1.2-2%) with training. Serum osteocalcin concentration was increased after training by 45 and 27% in men and women, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Fat mass was not altered by training. Vastus lateralis type II <e>MHC</e> composition at the start of the training program predicted 25% of the osteocalcin increase after training. Serum leptin concentration was reduced with training in women. In summary, while the relative effects of strength training plus plyometric jumps in performance, muscle hypertrophy, and osteogenesis are similar in men and women, serum leptin concentration is reduced only in women. The osteocalcin response to strength training is, in part, modulated by the muscle phenotype (MHC isoform composition). Despite the increase in osteocalcin, fat mass was not reduced.",M1
19178436,"Changes in gene expression during the formation of bioengineered heart muscle.A three-dimensional bioengineered heart muscle (BEHM) construct model had been previously developed, exhibiting contractile forces up to 800 microN. The interest of this study was to determine gene expression levels of biologic markers involved in calcium-handling between BEHM, cell monolayer, and neonatal heart. Cardiac cells were isolated from one litter of F344 rats and organized into groups (n = 5): 4-, 7-, 10-day BEHM and cell monolayer; BEHM was evaluated for cell viability and contractility. Groups were then analyzed for mRNA expression of calcium-handling proteins: myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) alpha and beta, Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ ATPase (SERCA) 2, phospholamban (PBL), and ryanodine receptor. BEHM exhibited electrically stimulated active force (208 +/- 12 microN day 4, 361 +/- 22 microN day 7, and 344 +/- 29 microN day 10) and no decrease in cell number. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed an increase in gene expression of all calcium-handling proteins in BEHM at 7 and 10 days compared with monolayers, for example, comparing BEHM to monolayer (7 and 10 days, respectively), MHC-alpha: 2600-fold increase and a 100-fold increase; MHC-beta: 70-fold increase at 10 days; ryanodine receptor: 74-fold increase at 10 days; SERCA: 19-fold increase and sixfold increase; PBL: 158-fold increase and 24-fold increase. It was concluded that a three-dimensional environment is a better culturing condition of cardiac cells than a monolayer. Also, BEHM constructs demonstrated a high similarity to a native myocardium, and is, thus, a good starting foundation for engineered heart muscle.",M1
19177556,"Reduction of type IIb myosin and IIB fibers in tibialis anterior muscle of mini-muscle mice from high-activity lines.Selective breeding of laboratory house mice (Mus domesticus) for high voluntary wheel running has generated four replicate lines that show an almost threefold increase in daily wheel-running distances as compared with four nonselected control lines. An unusual hindlimb  mini-muscle  phenotype (small muscles, increased mitochondrial enzyme levels, disorganized fiber distribution) has increased in frequency in two of the four replicate selected lines. The gene of major effect that accounts for this phenotype is an autosomal recessive that has been mapped to a 2.6335 Mb interval on MMU11, but not yet identified. This study examined the tibialis anterior muscle to determine whether changes in muscle fiber types could explain such modifications in muscle size and properties. Although selected and control lines did not exhibit systematic differences in the fiber types present in the tibialis anterior muscle, as assessed by electrophoresis of myosin heavy chains (<e>MHC</e>) and by histochemistry, mini-muscle mice lacked type IIB fibers and the corresponding MHCs. Mini-muscle tibialis show increased activities of hexokinase and citrate synthase compared with the normally sized muscles, likely the result of the modified fiber types in the muscle. The mini-muscle phenotype is the major means through which selective breeding for high wheel running has modified the functional capacities of the hindlimb muscles, as normally sized tibialis anterior muscles from control and selected lines did not show general differences in their enzymatic capacities, MHC profiles or fiber type composition, with the exception of an elevated hexokinase activity and a reduced GPa activity in the selected lines.",M1
19150852,"Exercise in space: human skeletal muscle after 6 months aboard the International Space Station.The aim of this investigation was to document the exercise program used by crewmembers (n = 9; 45 +/- 2 yr) while aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 6 mo and examine its effectiveness for preserving calf muscle characteristics. Before and after spaceflight, we assessed calf muscle volume (MRI), static and dynamic calf muscle performance, and muscle fiber types (gastrocnemius and soleus). While on the ISS, crewmembers had access to a running treadmill, cycle ergometer, and resistance exercise device. The exercise regimen varied among the crewmembers with aerobic exercise performed approximately 5 h/wk at a moderate intensity and resistance exercise performed 3-6 days/wk incorporating multiple lower leg exercises. Calf muscle volume decreased (P &lt; 0.05) 13 +/- 2% with greater (P &lt; 0.05) atrophy of the soleus (-15 +/- 2%) compared with the gastrocnemius (-10 +/- 2%). Peak power was 32% lower (P &lt; 0.05) after spaceflight. Force-velocity characteristics were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) -20 to -29% across the velocity spectrum. There was a 12-17% shift in myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) phenotype of the gastrocnemius and soleus with a decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in MHC I fibers and a redistribution among the faster phenotypes. These data show a reduction in calf muscle mass and performance along with a slow-to-fast fiber type transition in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are all qualities associated with unloading in humans. Future long-duration space missions should modify the current ISS exercise prescription and/or hardware to better preserve human skeletal muscle mass and function, thereby reducing the risk imposed to crewmembers.",M1
19125327,"Cardiac hypertrophy and thyroid hormone signaling.Thyroid hormone exerts a large number of influences on the cardiovascular system. Increased thyroid hormone action increases the force and speed of systolic contraction and the speed of diastolic relaxation and these are largely beneficial effects. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has marked electrophysiological effects increasing heart rate and the propensity for atrial fibrillation and these effects are largely mal-adaptive. In addition, thyroid hormone markedly increases cardiac angiogenesis and decreases vascular tone. These multiple thyroid hormone effects are largely mediated by the action of nuclear based thyroid hormone receptors (TR) the thyroid hormone receptor alpha and beta. TRalpha is the predominant isoform in the heart. Rapid nongenomic thyroid hormone effects also occur, which can be clearly demonstrated in ex-vivo experiments. Some of the most marked thyroid hormone effects in cardiac myocytes involve influences on calcium flux, with thyroid hormone promoting expression of the gene encoding the calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCa2). In contrast, in hypothyroid animals phospholamban levels, which inhibit the SERCa2 pump, are increased. In addition, marked effects are exerted on the calcium channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum the ryanodine channel. Related to myofibrillar proteins, myosin heavy chain alpha is increased by T3 and <e>MHC</e> beta is decreased. Complex and interesting interactions occur between cardiac hypertrophy induced by excess thyroid hormone action and cardiac hypertrophy occurring with heart failure. The thyroid hormone mediated cardiac hypertrophy in its initial phases presents a physiological hypertrophy with increases in SERCa2 levels and decreased expression of MHC beta. In contrast, pressure overload induced heart failure leads to a  pathological  cardiac hypertrophy which is largely mediated by activation of the calcineurin system and the MAPkinases signaling system. Recent evidence indicates that heart failure can lead to a downregulation of the thyroid hormone signaling system in the heart. In the failing heart, decreases of thyroid hormone receptor levels occur. In addition, serum levels of T4 and T3 are decreased with heart failure in the frame of the non-thyroidal illness syndrome. The decrease in T3 serves as an indicator for a bad prognosis in the heart failure patient being linked to increased mortality. In animal models, it can be shown that in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy a decrease of thyroid hormone receptor levels occurs. Cardiac function can be improved by increasing expression of thyroid hormone receptors mediated by adeno-associated virus based gene transfer. The failing heart may develop a  hypothyroid  status contributing to diminished cardiac contractile function.",M1
19111326,"The utilization of a biopsy needle to obtain small muscle tissue specimens to analyze the gene and protein expression.Recent analytical methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting have now enabled us to analyze the gene and protein expression from small amounts of tissue. A fine needle muscle biopsy is thus expected to obtain a minimally sufficient amount of skeletal muscle to make a successful analysis. As a result, we used this fine needle muscle biopsy technique to obtain muscle tissue specimens from the vastus lateral muscle in 40 participants. The amount of tissue obtained by the fine needle was 5.2 +/- 3.2 mg (mean +/- standard deviation). The total RNA extracted was 3.0 +/- 1.4 microg and the total protein extracted was 2203 +/- 1541 microg. Furthermore, the skeletal muscle tissue specimens obtained by the regular needle technique and blood sample were used as the control. Those specimens were used to measure the gene expression of beta-myosin heavy chain slow (beta-<e>MHC</e> slow) by real-time PCR and the protein expression of monocalboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) by Western blotting. Beta-MHC slow gene expression was detected in both samples obtained by a fine and a regular needle biopsy, but not in a blood sample. Furthermore, the MCT-1 protein was detected in samples obtained by a fine needle muscle biopsy. These results indicated that the fine needle muscle biopsy is therefore a useful technique to obtain skeletal muscle specimens at least to analyze the gene and protein expression.",M1
19108428,"[Effect of exogenous interferon gamma on the healing of injured skeletal muscle following injury]OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of combined injection with human interferon (hlFNgamma) and human insulin-link growth factor-1 (hIGF-1) on regeneration and fibrosis of skeletal muscle after acute contusion. METHODS: A standard contusion model was reproduced at the right gastrocnemius in 64 male mice of 7 to 12 weeks. All the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, such as group A (injection with hIFNgamma), group B (injection with hIGF-1), group C (injection with hIGF-1 and hIFNgamma), and group D (injection with physiological saline as control). All injections were introduced on day 10 after injury at local injured gastrocnemius. Before intervention (7 d following injury), and 4 d, 18 d, 32 d after intervention, the local injured gastrocnemius were harvested from 4 mice of each group. Then the expression of <e>MHC</e>- II b and vimentin was detected by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry techniques. RESULTS: (1) At the each time following intervention, the expression of MHC-II b mRNA and protein in local injured muscle of group B and C were significantly higher than those of group A and D. (2) After intervention,the expression of vimentin mRNA and protein in local injured muscle of group A, group B, and group C were more inhibited than those of group D. The inhibition of vimentin expression in group A and C was significant. CONCLUSION: It is indicated that injection of hIGF-1 into the injured skeletal muscle following acute contusion could enhance muscle regeneration,and inhibit fibrosis to some extent. (2) It is identified that hIFNgamma injected into injured muscle has the effect of anti-fibrosis, which is more significant than that of hIGF-1. (3) Combined injection with hIGF-1 and hIFNgamma could improve muscle regeneration and inhibit fibrosis simultaneously, and promote the healing of injured muscle.",M1
19040708,"Correlation of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and focal adhesion complex with myosin heavy chain isoforms in rat skeletal muscle.AIM: The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and focal adhesion complex (FAC) are transmembrane structures in muscle fibres that link the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. DGC and FAC proteins are abundant in slow-type muscles, indicating the structural reinforcement which play a pivotal role in continuous force output to maintain posture for long periods. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of these structures across fast-type muscles containing different myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform patterns which reflect the fatigue-resistant characteristics of skeletal muscle. METHODS: We measured the expression of dystrophin and beta1 integrin (representative proteins of DGC and FAC respectively) in plantaris, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, red and white portions of gastrocnemius, superficial portion of vastus lateralis and diaphragm, in comparison with soleus (SOL) and cardiac muscle from rats. RESULTS: The expression of dystrophin and beta1 integrin correlated positively with the percentage of type I, IIa and IIx MHC isoforms and negatively with that of type IIb MHC isoform in fast-type skeletal muscles, and their expression was abundant in SOL and cardiac muscle. CONCLUSION: Our results support the idea that DGC and FAC are among the factors that explain the fatigue-resistant property not only of slow-type but also of fast-type skeletal muscles.",M1
19023131,"Ca2+-independent alterations in diastolic sarcomere length and relaxation kinetics in a mouse model of lipotoxic diabetic cardiomyopathy.Previous studies demonstrated increased fatty acid uptake and metabolism in <e>MHC</e>-FATP transgenic mice that overexpress fatty acid transport protein (FATP)1 in the heart under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) promoter. Doppler tissue imaging and hemodynamic measurements revealed diastolic dysfunction, in the absence of changes in systolic function. The experiments here directly test the hypothesis that the diastolic dysfunction in MHC-FATP mice reflects impaired ventricular myocyte contractile function. In vitro imaging of isolated adult MHC-FATP ventricular myocytes revealed that mean diastolic sarcomere length is significantly (P&lt;0.01) shorter than in wild-type (WT) cells (1.79+/-0.01 versus 1.84+/-0.01 microm). In addition, the relaxation rate (dL/dt) is significantly (P&lt;0.05) slower in MHC-FATP than WT myocytes (1.58+/-0.09 versus 1.92+/-0.13 microm/s), whereas both fractional shortening and contraction rates are not different. Application of 40 mmol/L 2,3-butadionemonoxime (a nonspecific ATPase inhibitor that relaxes actin-myosin interactions) increased diastolic sarcomere length in both WT and MHC-FATP myocytes to the same length, suggesting that MHC-FATP myocytes are partially activated at rest. Direct measurements of intracellular Ca(2+) revealed that diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) is unchanged in MHC-FATP myocytes and the rate of calcium removal is unexpectedly faster in MHC-FATP than WT myocytes. Moreover, diastolic sarcomere length in MHC-FATP and WT myocytes was unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or by buffering of intracellular Ca(2+) with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA (100 micromol/L), indicating that elevated intracellular Ca(2+) does not underlie impaired diastolic function in MHC-FATP ventricular myocytes. Functional assessment of skinned myocytes, however, revealed that myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity is markedly increased in MHC-FATP, compared with WT, ventricular cells. In addition, biochemical experiments demonstrated increased expression of the beta-MHC isoform in MHC-FATP, compared with WT ventricles, which likely contributes to the slower relaxation rate observed in MHC-FATP myocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that derangements in lipid metabolism in MHC-FATP ventricles, which are similar to those observed in the diabetic heart, result in impaired diastolic function that primarily reflects changes in myofilament function, rather than altered Ca(2+) cycling.",M1
18978449,"Fiber type composition of cadaveric human rotator cuff muscles.STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cadaveric laboratory study. OBJECTIVE: To identify the fiber type composition of the rotator cuff and teres major muscles in human subjects. BACKGROUND: The rotator cuff is commonly injured in athletics and is a major focus of sports medicine. Although the anatomy and architecture of each muscle have been described in great detail, these muscles have never been fiber typed using immunohistochemistry or gel electrophoresis. Fiber typing is important in modeling function, exercise training, and rehabilitation. METHODS AND MEASURES: We harvested tissue samples for all 4 rotator cuff muscles, as well as the teres major muscle from cadavers. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned. Cryosections were labeled with commercially available antibodies against fast and slow isoforms of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>). We also harvested fresh (unembalmed) tissue from deceased subjects and labeled tissue sections with antibodies against fast or slow MHC and wheat germ agglutinin. Gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining was also used to identify and quantify MHC isoforms in fresh tissue samples. RESULTS: All of the muscles were of mixed fiber type composition. As a whole, 44% of rotator cuff fibers labeled positively for slow MHC, with slow MHC content of 54% in supraspinatus, 41% in infraspinatus, 49% in teres minor, 38% in subscapularis, and 40% in teres major. Mixed MHC isoform distribution was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, which also indicated that the IIa and IIx isoforms were roughly equally present across the muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Human rotator cuff muscles, at least in older subjects, have a mixed fiber type. Because we only examined older subjects, we must limit our interpretation to this population.",M1
18945940,"Slow myosin heavy chain expression in the absence of muscle activity.Innervation has been generally accepted to be a major factor involved in both triggering and maintaining the expression of slow myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>-1) in skeletal muscle. However, previous findings from our laboratory have suggested that, in the mouse, this is not always the case (30). Based on these results, we hypothesized that neurotomy would not markedly reduced the expression of MHC-1 protein in the mouse soleus muscles. In addition, other cellular, biochemical, and functional parameters were also studied in these denervated soleus muscles to complete our study. Our results show that denervation reduced neither the relative amount of MHC-1 protein, nor the percentage of muscle fibers expressing MHC-1 protein (P &gt; 0.05). The fact that MHC-1 protein did not respond to muscle inactivity was confirmed in three different mouse strains (129/SV, C57BL/6, and CD1). In contrast, all of the other histological, biochemical, and functional muscle parameters were markedly altered by denervation. Cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscle fibers, maximal tetanic isometric force, maximal velocity of shortening, maximal power, and citrate synthase activity were all reduced in denervated muscles compared with innervated muscles (P &lt; 0.05). Contraction and one-half relaxation times of the twitch were also increased by denervation (P &lt; 0.05). Addition of tenotomy to denervation had no further effect on the relative expression of MHC-1 protein (P &gt; 0.05), despite a greater reduction in CSA and citrate synthase activity (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, a deficit in neural input leads to marked atrophy and reduction in performance in mouse soleus muscles. However, the maintenance of the relative expression of slow MHC protein is independent of neuromuscular activity in mice.",M1
18855898,"Induction and modulation of smooth muscle differentiation in Xenopus embryonic cells.By comparison with skeletal or cardiac developmental programs, little is known regarding the specific factors that promote specification and differentiation of smooth muscle cells from pluripotent cells. We have analyzed the developmental expression of a subset of smooth muscle genes during Xenopus early development and showed that similar to mammals and avians, Xenopus smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-<e>MHC</e>) is a highly specific marker of smooth muscle differentiation. Embryonic cells from animal pole explants of Xenopus blastula can be induced by basic fibroblast growth factor, Wnt, and bone morphogenetic protein signals to adopt the smooth muscle pathway. Explants from early embryos that contain neural crest cells can also differentiate into cells expressing smooth muscle genes. We examined the interplay of several transcription factors, that is SRF, myocardin, and GATA6, that induce the expression of SM-MHC in animal cap cells and found that myocardin-dependent expression of smooth muscle genes in animal cap cells is synergized by SRF but is strongly antagonized by GATA6.",M1
18851973,"cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling negatively regulates Gq-coupled receptor-mediated fetal gene response in cardiomyocytes.The treatment with beta-blockers causes an enhancement of the norepinephrine-induced fetal gene response in cultured cardiomyocytes. Here, we tested whether the activation of cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR)-mediated fetal gene response. To address this question, the fetal gene program, of which atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the beta-isoform of myosin heavy chain are classical members, was induced by phenylephrine (PE), an alpha(1)-AR agonist. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we found that stimulation of beta-ARs with isoproterenol, a beta-AR agonist, inhibited the fetal gene expression induced by PE. Similar results were also observed when cardiomyocytes were treated with forskolin (FSK), a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, or 8-CPT-6-Phe-cAMP, a selective activator of protein kinase A (PKA). Conversely, the PE-induced fetal gene expression was further upregulated by H89, a selective PKA inhibitor. To evaluate whether these results could be generalized to Gq-mediated signaling and not specifically to alpha(1)-ARs, cardiomyocytes were treated with prostaglandin F(2)alpha, another Gq-coupled receptor agonist, which is able to promote fetal gene expression. This treatment caused an increase of both ANP mRNA and protein levels, which was almost completely abolished by FSK treatment. The capability of beta-adrenergic signaling to regulate the fetal gene expression was also evaluated in vivo conditions by using beta1- and beta2-AR double knockout mice, in which the predominant cardiac beta-AR subtypes are lacking, or by administering isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-AR agonist, at a subpressor dose. A significant increase of the fetal gene expression was found in beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR gene deficient mice. Conversely, we found that ANP, beta-<e>MHC</e> and skACT mRNA levels were significantly decreased in ISO-treated hearts. Collectively, these data indicate that cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic signaling negatively regulates Gq cascade activation-induced fetal gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes and that this inhibitory regulation is already operative in the mouse heart under physiological conditions.",M1
18816601,"Adaptive and nonadaptive responses to voluntary wheel running by mdx mice.The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which hindlimb muscles of mdx mice adapt to a voluntary endurance type of exercise. mdx and C57BL mice engaged in 8 weeks of wheel running or maintained normal cage activities. Beneficial adaptations that occurred in mdx mice included changes in muscle mass, fiber size, and fiber types based on myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform expression. These adaptations occurred without increases in fiber central nuclei and embryonic MHC expression. An undesirable outcome, however, was that muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities did not improve with exercise in mdx mice as they did in C57BL mice. Cellular remodeling of dystrophic muscle following exercise has not been studied adequately. In this study we found that some, but not all, of the expected adaptations occurred in mdx mouse muscle. We must better understand these (non)adaptations in order to inform individuals with DMD about the benefits of exercise.",M1
18798247,"Enzyme- and immunohistochemical aspects of skeletal muscle fibers in brown bear (Ursus arctos).To further elucidate the pattern of <e>MHC</e> isoform expression in skeletal muscles of large mammals, in this study the skeletal muscles of brown bear, one of the largest mammalian predators with an extraordinary locomotor capacity, were analyzed. Fiber types in longissimus dorsi, triceps brachii caput longum, and rectus femoris muscles were determined according to the myofibrillar ATPase (mATPase) histochemistry and MHC isoform expression, revealed by a set of antibodies specific to MHC isoforms. The oxidative (SDH) and glycolytic enzyme (alpha-GPDH) capacity of fibers was demonstrated as well. By mATPase histochemistry five fiber types, i.e., I, IIC, IIA, IIAX, IIX were distinguished. Analyzing the MHC isoform expression, we assume that MHC-I, -IIa, and -IIx are expressed in the muscles of adolescent bears. MHC-I isoform was expressed in Type-I fibers and coexpressed with presumably -IIa isoform, in Type-IIC fibers. Surprisingly, two antibodies specific to rat MHC-IIa stained those fast fibers, that were histochemically and immunohistochemically classified as Type IIX. This assumption was additionally confirmed by complete absence of fiber staining with antibody specific to rat MHC-IIb and all fast fiber staining with antibody that according to our experience recognizes MHC-IIa and -IIx of rat. Furthermore, quite high-oxidative capacity of all fast fiber types and their weak glycolytic capacity also imply for MHC-IIa and -IIx isoform expression in fast fibers of bear. However, in adult, full-grown animal, only MHC-I and MHC-IIa isoforms were expressed. The expression of only two fast isoforms in bear, like in many other large mammals (humans, cat, dog, goat, cattle, and horse) obviously meets the weight-bearing and locomotor demands of these mammals.",M1
18787090,"Changes in muscle size and <e>MHC</e> composition in response to resistance exercise with heavy and light loading intensity.Muscle mass accretion is accomplished by heavy-load resistance training. The effect of light-load resistance exercise has been far more sparsely investigated with regard to potential effect on muscle size and contractile strength. We applied a resistance exercise protocol in which the same individual trained one leg at 70% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) (heavy load, HL) while training the other leg at 15.5% 1RM (light load, LL). Eleven sedentary men (age 25 +/- 1 yr) trained for 12 wk at three times/week. Before and after the intervention muscle hypertrophy was determined by magnetic resonance imaging, muscle biopsies were obtained bilaterally from vastus lateralis for determination of myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition, and maximal muscle strength was assessed by 1RM testing and in an isokinetic dynamometer at 60 degrees /s. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area increased (P &lt; 0.05) 8 +/- 1% and 3 +/- 1% in HL and LL legs, respectively, with a greater gain in HL than LL (P &lt; 0.05). Likewise, 1RM strength increased (P &lt; 0.001) in both legs (HL: 36 +/- 5%, LL: 19 +/- 2%), albeit more so with HL (P &lt; 0.01). Isokinetic 60 degrees /s muscle strength improved by 13 +/- 5% (P &lt; 0.05) in HL but remained unchanged in LL (4 +/- 5%, not significant). Finally, MHC IIX protein expression was decreased with HL but not LL, despite identical total workload in HL and LL. Our main finding was that LL resistance training was sufficient to induce a small but significant muscle hypertrophy in healthy young men. However, LL resistance training was inferior to HL training in evoking adaptive changes in muscle size and contractile strength and was insufficient to induce changes in MHC composition.",M1
18787035,"Transmural variation in myosin heavy chain isoform expression modulates the timing of myocardial force generation in porcine left ventricle.Recent studies have shown that the sequence and timing of mechanical activation of myocardium vary across the ventricular wall. However, the contributions of variable expression of myofilament protein isoforms in mediating the timing of myocardial activation in ventricular systole are not well understood. To assess the functional consequences of transmural differences in myofilament protein expression, we studied the dynamic mechanical properties of multicellular skinned preparations isolated from the sub-endocardial and sub-epicardial regions of the porcine ventricular midwall. Compared to endocardial fibres, epicardial fibres exhibited significantly faster rates of stretch activation and force redevelopment (k(tr)), although the amount of force produced at a given [Ca2+] was not significantly different. Consistent with these results, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed significantly elevated expression of alpha myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform in epicardial fibres (13 +/- 1%) versus endocardial fibres (3 +/- 1%). Linear regression analysis revealed that the apparent rates of delayed force development and force decay following stretch correlated with MHC isoform expression (r2 = 0.80 and r2 = 0.73, respectively, P &lt; 0.05). No differences in the relative abundance or phosphorylation status of other myofilament proteins were detected. These data show that transmural differences in MHC isoform expression contribute to regional differences in dynamic mechanical function of porcine left ventricles, which in turn modulate the timing of force generation across the ventricular wall and work production during systole.",M1
18787025,"Connexin40 messenger ribonucleic acid is positively regulated by thyroid hormone (TH) acting in cardiac atria via the TH receptor.Thyroid hormone (TH) regulates many cardiac genes via nuclear thyroid receptors, and hyperthyroidism is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. Electrical activity propagation in myocardium depends on the transfer of current at gap junctions, and connexins (Cxs) 40 and 43 are the predominant junction proteins. In mice, Cx40, the main Cx involved in atrial conduction, is restricted to the atria and fibers of the conduction system, which also express Cx43. We studied cardiac expression of Cx40 and Cx43 in conjunction with electrocardiogram studies in mice overexpressing the dominant negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor-beta Delta337T exclusively in cardiomyocytes [myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>-mutant)]. These mice develop the cardiac hypothyroid phenotype in the presence of normal serum TH. Expression was also examined in wild-type mice rendered hypothyroid or hyperthyroid by pharmacological treatment. Atrial Cx40 mRNA and protein levels were decreased (85 and 55%, respectively; P &lt; 0.001) in MHC-mt mice. Atrial and ventricular Cx43 mRNA levels were not significantly changed. Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid animals showed a 25% decrease and 40% increase, respectively, in Cx40 mRNA abundance. However, MHC-mt mice presented very low Cx40 mRNA expression regardless of whether they were made hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. Atrial depolarization velocity, as represented by P wave duration in electrocardiograms of unanesthetized mice, was extremely reduced in MHC-mt mice, and to a lesser extent also in hypothyroid mice (90 and 30% increase in P wave duration). In contrast, this measure was increased in hyperthyroid mice (19% decrease in P wave duration). Therefore, this study reveals for the first time that Cx40 mRNA is up-regulated by TH acting in cardiac atria via the TH receptor and that this may be one of the mechanisms contributing to atrial conduction alterations in thyroid dysfunctions.",M1
18677504,"Long-term resistance training improves force and unloaded shortening velocity of single muscle fibres of elderly women.Four elderly women (78 +/- 4.3 years) were resistance trained (RT) for one year and needle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken pre- and post-RT. A training intensity of 60% one-repetition maximum (1RM) was adopted for the entire duration of the study. Following RT, significant gain in isometric force of the quadriceps muscles was observed and <e>MHC</e> isoform distribution of vastus lateralis muscle showed a very significant shift from MHC-1 and MHC-2X towards MHC-2A, i.e. a bi-directional shift. A large population (n = 310) of individual skinned muscle fibres were dissected from biopsy samples and used for determination of cross-sectional area (CSA), specific force (Po/CSA) and unloaded shortening velocity (Vo) at 12 degrees C and maximum activation. Fibres were classified on the basis of their MHC isoform content determined by SDS-PAGE in three pure fibre types (1, 2A and 2X) and two hybrid fibre types (1-2A and 2AX). Whereas the CSA of individual muscle fibres did not change, Po/CSA was significantly higher in both type 1 and type 2A fibres post training. Vo of type 1 fibres was significantly higher post-training, whereas no change in Vo was observed in type 2A fibres. The number of pure type 2X fibres was very low especially post-training and did not enable a statistically significant comparison. The data suggest that in elderly women moderate and prolonged RT: (1) can determine similar adaptations in MHC distribution of skeletal muscle to those expected in young subjects; (2) can improve function of muscle fibres.",M1
18631005,"Differential regulation of the myosin heavy chain genes alpha and beta in rat atria and ventricles: role of antisense RNA.BACKGROUND: The myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) genes are regulated by triiodothyronine (T3) in a reciprocal and chamber-specific manner. To further our understanding of the potential mechanisms involved, we determined the T3 responsiveness of the MHC genes, alpha and beta, and the beta-MHC antisense (AS) gene in the rat ventricles and atria. METHODS: Hypothyroid rats were administered a single physiologic (1 microg) or pharmacologic (20 microg) dose of T3, and sequential measurements of beta-MHC hn- and AS RNA and alpha-MHC heterogeneous nuclear RNA from rat ventricular and atrial myocardium were performed with reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that T3 treatment increases the myocyte content of an AS beta-MHC RNA in atria and ventricles that includes sequences complementary to both the first 5' and last 3' introns of the beta-MHC sense transcript. In the hypothyroid rat ventricle, beta-MHC sense RNA expression is maximal, while in the euthyroid rat ventricle, beta-MHC AS RNA is maximal. beta-MHC AS expression increased by 52 +/- 9.8% at the peak, 24 hours after injection of a physiologic dose of T3 (1 microg/animal), while beta-MHC sense RNA decreased by 41 +/- 2.2% at 36 hours, the nadir. In hypothyroid atria, beta-MHC AS RNA was induced by threefold within 6 hours of administration of 1 microg T3, demonstrating that in the atria, beta-MHC AS expression is regulated by T3, while alpha-MHC expression is not. CONCLUSIONS: In the hypothyroid rat heart ventricle, beta-MHC AS RNA expression increases in response to T3 similar to that of alpha-MHC. Simultaneous measures of beta-MHC sense RNA are decreased, suggesting a possible mechanism for AS to regulate sense expression. In atria, while alpha-MHC is not influenced by thyroid state, beta-MHC sense and AS RNA were simultaneously and inversely altered in response to T3. This confirms a close positive relationship between T3 and beta-MHC AS RNA in both the atria and ventricles, while demonstrating for the first time that alpha- and beta-MHC expression is not coupled in the atria.",M1
18514625,"Oral amino acid supplementation counteracts age-induced sarcopenia in elderly rats.We investigated the effects of a specific mixture of amino acid (AA) supplements on the adaptation changes induced by aging in the soleus muscle of rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 5 each): young control (YO), 3 months of age; elderly control (EL), 18 months of age; and elderly orally supplemented with an AA mixture (EL-AA), 18 months of age, given as 0.1 g/kg per day in drinking water for 8 weeks. Myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) composition was analyzed in all muscles. The total fiber number and fiber cross-sectional area of types 1 and 2A fibers were also measured in immunostained sections of the soleus muscle. The ratios between the sarcomere volume (Vsar) and the total volume (Vtot) and single muscle fibers were studied by electron microscopy. The expression of total and phosphorylated serine/threonine protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a potent regulator of messenger RNA translation initiation, was also determined in all groups. Aging was associated with an overall shift toward the expression of a slower MHC phenotype, atrophy of fast and slow fibers, a significant decrease in Vtot/Vsar, and no changes in total fiber number. AA supplementation antagonized the effects of aging. A shift toward the expression of faster MHC isoforms was observed. Fiber atrophy appeared to be partly counteracted by the AA supplements; we noted an increase in cross-sectional area fibers and Vtot/Vsar in EL-AAs. Total and phosphorylated mTOR expression appeared to decrease in EL and was restored by the AA supplements. Collectively, these results suggest that aging-induced muscle adaptations can be partly restored by AA supplementation. An mTOR signal pathway may mediate the effects on fiber trophism.",M1
18575454,"[Experiment of adipose derived stem cells induced into smooth muscle cells]OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of human adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) in monolayer culture induced into smooth muscle cells in vitro as seeding cells in vascular tissue engineering. METHODS: The mononuclear cells in human adipose were separated by collagenase treatment and seeded on culture dishes with the density of 5 x 10(5)/cm2. Cells were cultured in M-199 plus 10% FBS. When reaching confluence, the cells were subcultured by 0.1% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA treatment, PDGF-BB (50 ng/mL) and TGF-beta1 (5 ng/mL) were added at the passage 1 to enhance the smooth muscle cells' phenotype. Cells were cultured under the inducing medium for 14 days. The morphology of induced cells was observed under the microscope. Cellular immunofluorescence and RT-PCR were used to determine the expression of smooth muscle cell markers of the post-induced cells. Flow cytometry (FACs) was used to examine the positive rate of induced team. RESULTS: Cocultured in M-199 media including TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB, the proliferating capability of the induced cells was significantly downregulated compared with the uninduced cells (P &lt; 0.01). The induced cells exhibited  Hill and Valley  morphology, while the uninduced cells were similar to ADSCs of P0 which had the fibroblast-like morphology. The results of immunofluorescence indicated that the induced cells expressed smoothmuscle (SM) cell-specific markers including a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-<e>MHC</e>) and Calponin. The results of RT-PCR revealed that the induced cells also expressed alpha-SMA, SM-MHC, Calponin and SM-22alpha. The positive rates of alpha-SMA, SM-MHC and Calponin in FACs were 3.26% +/- 1.31%, 3.55% +/- 1.6% and 4.02% +/- 1.81%, respectively, before the cells were induced. However, 14 days after the cell induction, the positive rates were 48.13% +/- 8.31%, 45.33% +/- 10.68% and 39.13% +/- 9.42%, respectively. The positive rates in induced cells were remarkably higher than those in uninduced cells (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The human ADSCs can be induced to express vascular smooth muscle markers, and they are a new potential source of vascular tissue engineering.",M1
18560895,"Genetic inactivation of acetylcholinesterase causes functional and structural impairment of mouse soleus muscles.Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays an essential role in neuromuscular transmission. Not surprisingly, neuromuscular transmission during repetitive nerve stimulation is severely depressed in the AChE knockout mouse (KO). However, whether this deficit in AChE leads to skeletal muscle changes is not known. We have studied the in vitro contractile properties of the postural and locomotor soleus muscles of adult KO and normal (wildtype, WT) mice, and this was completed by histological and biochemical analyses. Our results show that muscle weight, cross-sectional area of muscle fibres and absolute maximal isometric force are all reduced in KO mice compared with WT mice. Of interest, the relative amount of slow myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>-1) in muscle homogenates and the percentage of muscle fibres expressing MHC-1 are decreased in the KO mice. Surprisingly, AChE ablation does not modify twitch kinetics, absolute maximal power, fatigue resistance or citrate synthase activity, despite the reduced number of slow muscle fibres. Thus, a deficit in AChE leads to alterations in the structure and function of muscles but these changes are not simply related to the reduced body weight of KO mice. Our results also suggest that this murine model of congenital myasthenic syndrome with endplate AChE deficiency combines alterations in both neurotransmission and intrinsic muscle properties.",M1
18535124,"Single muscle fiber contractile properties of young competitive distance runners.The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the contractile properties of individual slow- and fast-twitch myofibers from highly trained distance runners. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius of eight competitive runners (Run) and eight recreationally active individuals (Rec). Slow-twitch [myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) I] and fast-twitch (MHC IIa) myofibers were isolated and analyzed for diameter (microm), peak force (Po; mN), unloaded contraction velocity (Vo; fiber lengths/s), and power. Maximum oxygen uptake was higher (P&lt;0.05) in Run (71+/-1 vs. 47+/-2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)). Diameter of MHC I and MHC IIa fibers from Run subjects was approximately 20% greater (P&lt;0.05) than Rec. Peak force of the MHC IIa fibers was 31% higher (P&lt;0.05) in Run, whereas Po of MHC I fibers was not different between groups. No differences for specific tension (Po/cross-sectional area) were present between groups for either fiber type. Vo was higher (P&lt;0.05) in MHC I (+70%) and MHC IIa (+18%) fibers from Run subjects. In vitro peak absolute power (microN.s(-1)) of both fiber types was greater (P&lt;0.05) in Run (131 and 85% for MHC I and MHC IIa, respectively). Additionally, normalized power (W/l) of the MHC I fibers was 64% higher in Run, whereas no differences were noted for normalized power of MHC IIa fibers. These data indicate that highly trained endurance runners have elevated contraction velocity in both slow- and fast-twitch myofibers. These characteristics of the fast-twitch muscle fibers have not been previously reported in competitive endurance athletes and may contribute to the high level of running performance in these athletes.",M1
18495152,"CRNK gene transfer improves function and reverses the myosin heavy chain isoenzyme switch during post-myocardial infarction left ventricular remodeling.PYK2 is a Ca(2+)-dependent, nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that is involved in the induction of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and its transition to heart failure. We and others have previously investigated PYK2's function in vitro using cultured neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes as model systems. However, the function of PYK2 in the in vivo adult heart remains unclear. Here we evaluate the effect of PYK2 inhibition following myocardial infarction (MI) using adenoviral (Adv) overexpression of the C-terminal domain of PYK2, known as CRNK. First we demonstrate that CRNK functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of PYK2-dependent signaling, presumably by displacing PYK2 from focal adhesions and costameres. Then, male Sprague-Dawley rats (~300 g) underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. One wk post-MI, either Adv-GFP (n=34) or Adv-CRNK (n=28) was administered (10(10) pfu, 0.1 ml) via catheter-based, Optison-mediated gene transfer. LV structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography 1 and 3 wk after gene transfer, and LV tissue was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. CRNK overexpression was readily detected by Western blotting 1 wk following gene transfer. Adv-CRNK improved overall survival (P=0.03; Logrank Test) and LV fractional shortening (23+/-2% vs. 31+/-2% for Adv-GFP vs. Adv-CRNK infected animals, respectively; P&lt;0.05). Whereas MI hearts exhibited increased beta-, and decreased alpha-myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) mRNA expression characteristic of LVH, Adv-CRNK reversed the MHC isoenzyme switch (3.3+/-1.4 fold increase in alpha MHC; 0.4+/-0.1 fold decrease in beta MHC; P&lt;0.05 for both). In summary, CRNK gene transfer improves survival, increases LV function, and alters MHC gene expression suggesting an attenuation of LV remodeling post-MI.",M1
18480046,"Functional effects of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy R403Q mutation are different in an alpha- or beta-myosin heavy chain backbone.The R403Q mutation in the beta-myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) was the first mutation to be linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), a primary disease of heart muscle. The initial studies with R403Q myosin, isolated from biopsies of patients, showed a large decrease in myosin motor function, leading to the hypothesis that hypertrophy was a compensatory response. The introduction of the mouse model for FHC (the mouse expresses predominantly alpha-MHC as opposed to the beta-isoform in larger mammals) created a new paradigm for FHC based on finding enhanced motor function for R403Q alpha-MHC. To help resolve these conflicting mechanisms, we used a transgenic mouse model in which the endogenous alpha-MHC was largely replaced with transgenically encoded beta-MHC. A His(6) tag was cloned at the N terminus of the alpha-and beta-MHC to facilitate protein isolation by Ni(2+)-chelating chromatography. Characterization of the R403Q alpha-MHC by the in vitro motility assay showed a 30-40% increase in actin filament velocity compared with wild type, consistent with published studies. In contrast, the R403Q mutation in a beta-MHC backbone showed no enhancement in velocity. Cleavage of the His-tagged myosin by chymotrypsin made it possible to isolate homogeneous myosin subfragment 1 (S1), uncontaminated by endogenous myosin. We find that the actin-activated MgATPase activity for R403Q alpha-S1 is approximately 30% higher than for wild type, whereas the enzymatic activity for R403Q beta-S1 is reduced by approximately 10%. Thus, the functional consequences of the mutation are fundamentally changed depending upon the context of the cardiac MHC isoform.",M1
18468460,"Hypoxia affects positively the proliferation of bovine satellite cells and their myogenic differentiation through up-regulation of MyoD.Hypoxia alters the biological functions of skeletal muscle cells to proliferate and differentiate into myotubes. However, the cellular responses of myoblasts to hypoxia differ according to the levels of oxygen and the types of cells studied. This study examined the effect of hypoxia (1% oxygen) on bovine satellite cells. Hypoxia significantly increased the proliferation of satellite cells cultured in a growth medium. In addition, the levels of PCNA, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) and CDK2 expression were increased. Hypoxia facilitated the formation of myotubes as well as the stimulation of MyoD, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) expression in differentiating medium (DM) cultures. In particular, satellite cells cultured under hypoxic/DM conditions showed increased p21 expression but not p27. The transfection of satellite cells with antisense MyoD oligonucleotides resulted in a decrease in the MHC, myogenin, MRF4 RNA and protein levels with the concomitant decrease in fused cells to levels similar to those observed under normoxia/DM conditions. This indicates that MyoD up-regulation is closely associated with hypoxia-stimulated myogenic differentiation. In conclusion, hypoxia stimulates the proliferation of satellite cells and promotes their myogenic differentiation with MyoD playing an important role.",M1

Histochemical analyses were used to determine the fibre type distribution and the fibre cross-sectional area. MHC isoform composition of single fibres was determined with protein electrophoresis. The percentage of fibres expressing MHC IIA and MHC I/IIA was larger in BB (P &lt; 0.05), while MHC IIX was completely absent (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, myofibrilar ATPase histochemistry only revealed a significantly lower percentage of type IIX fibres in BB (P &lt; 0.05).

The TG followed 6 weeks of combined weight lifting and plyometric exercises. In all subjects, tests were performed to measure their maximal angular speed of the knee during in-step kicks on a stationary ball. Additional tests for muscle power (vertical jump), running speed (30 m running test), anaerobic capacity (Wingate and 300 m running tests), and aerobic power (20 m shuttle run tests) were also performed. Training resulted in muscle hypertrophy (+4.3%), increased peak angular velocity of the knee during kicking (+13.6%), increased percentage of myosin heavy-chain (<e>MHC</e>) type IIa (+8.4%), increased 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) of inclined leg press (ILP) (+61.4%), leg extension (LE) (+20.2%), leg curl (+15.9%), and half squat (HQ) (+45.1%), and enhanced performance in vertical jump (all p &lt; or = 0.05). In contrast, MHC type I was reduced (-5.2%, p &lt; or = 0.05) after training. In the control group, these variables remained unchanged. In conclusion, 6 weeks of strength training combining weight lifting and plyometric exercises results in significant improvement of kicking performance, as well as other physical capacities related to success in football (soccer).",M1

The pathways that regulate MHC expression during HF have not been described, and myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) may be involved. The purpose of this investigation was to determine MRF mRNA expression levels in the diaphragm. Diaphragm muscle from both HF and control Wistar rats was studied when overt HF had developed, 22 days after monocrotaline administration. MyoD, myogenin and MRF4 gene expression were determined by RT-PCR and MHC isoforms by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Heart failure animals presented decreased MHC IIa/IIx protein isoform and MyoD gene expression, without altering MHC I, IIb, myogenin and MRF4. Our results show that in HF, MyoD is selectively down-regulated, which might be associated with alterations in MHC IIa/IIx content. These changes are likely to contribute to the diaphragm myopathy caused by HF.",M1
18456726,"The benefit of medium-chain triglyceride therapy on the cardiac function of SHRs is associated with a reversal of metabolic and signaling alterations.The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a model of cardiomyopathy that displays a genetic defect in cardiac fatty acid (FA) translocase/CD36, a plasma membrane long-chain FA transporter. Therapy with medium-chain FAs, which do not require CD36-facilitated transport, has been shown to improve cardiac function and hypertrophy in SHRs despite persistent hypertension. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to document the impact of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) therapy in SHRs on the expression level and activity of metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways. Four-week-old male SHRs were administered MCT (SHR-MCT) or long-chain triglyceride (SHR-LCT) for 16 wk. We used Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as controls (WKY-MCT and WKY-LCT). The SHR-MCT group displayed improved cardiac dysfunction [as assessed by left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and the positive and negative first derivatives of LV pressure/P value], a shift in the beta-myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>)-to-alpha-MHC ratio, and cardiac hypertrophy compared with the SHR-LCT group without an effect on blood pressure. Administration of MCT of SHRs reversed the LCT-induced reduction in the cardiac FA metabolic enzymatic activities of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). In the SHR-MCT group, the protein expression and transcriptional regulation of myocardial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, which regulates the transcription of LCHAD and MCAD genes, corresponded to the changes seen in those enzymatic activities. Furthermore, MCT intake caused an inhibition of JNK activation in SHR hearts. Collectively, the observed changes in the myocardial activity of metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways may contribute to the improved cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy in SHRs following MCT therapy.",M1
18445515,"Age-dependent effects of treadmill exercise during a period of inactivity.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a treadmill exercise protocol to prevent muscle weakness, atrophy and alterations in calcium regulation in adult, old and very old rats. Adult (7-12 months), old (29-30 months) and very old (34-36 months) F344BNF(1) rats were randomly assigned to weight bearing (WB), weight bearing exercise (WBX), non-weight bearing (NWB) and non-weight bearing exercise (NWBX) groups. The WB group was considered the sedentary-control animals. NWB rats were hindlimb unweighted for 14 days. WBX and NWBX groups were exercised on a treadmill for approximately 15 min four times daily. The contractile properties [diameter, peak active force (P(0)), specific tension (P(0)/CSA)] of single myosin heavy chain type II fibers and Ca regulation [Ca(2+) dependent ATPase activity] were determined. Fiber diameter reduced by 24% in the very old rats with NWB. P(0) and P(0)/CSA declined in the young adult and very old rats with NWB. NWBX attenuated these changes in the young and very old rats. Ca(2+) dependent ATPase activity increased with treadmill exercise during non-weight bearing in the young animals. In conclusion, the treadmill exercise is beneficial in attenuating the non-weight bearing-induced changes in the individual <e>MHC</e> type II muscle fibers of the gastrocnemius muscle.",M1
18438235,"The influence of myosin heavy chain isoform composition and training status on the patterns of responses for mechanomyographic amplitude versus isometric torque.The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform composition and training status on the mechanomyographic (MMG) amplitude versus isometric torque relationship for the vastus lateralis. Five resistance-trained (mean +/- SD age = 23.2 +/- 3.7 years), 5 aerobically trained (mean +/- SD age = 32.6 +/- 5.2 years), and 5 sedentary (mean +/- SD age = 23.4 +/- 4.1 years) men performed isometric muscle actions of the leg extensors in 20% increments from 20% to 100% of the maximum voluntary contraction. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis revealed that the MHC composition for the resistance-trained subjects was 59.0 +/- 4.2% Type IIa, 0.1 +/- 0.1% Type IIx, and 40.9 +/- 4.3% Type I. The aerobically-trained subjects had 27.4 +/- 7.8% Type IIa, 0.0 +/- 0.0% Type IIx, and 72.6 +/- 7.8% Type I MHC. The sedentary subjects had 42.1 +/- 7.8% Type IIa, 17.8 +/- 6.4% Type IIx, and 40.1 +/- 10.9% Type I MHC. There were no consistent patterns of responses for the resistance-trained, aerobically trained, or sedentary subjects for MMG amplitude versus torque. Thus, differences in MHC isoform composition and training status did not explain the unique torque-related patterns for MMG amplitude.",M1
18417650,"Paradoxical effects of endurance training and chronic hypoxia on myofibrillar ATPase activity.This study aimed to determine the changes in soleus myofibrillar ATPase (m-ATPase) activity and myosin heavy chain (<e>MHC</e>) isoform expression after endurance training and/or chronic hypoxic exposure. Dark Agouti rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, normoxic sedentary (N; n = 14), normoxic endurance trained (NT; n = 14), hypoxic sedentary (H; n = 10), and hypoxic endurance trained (HT; n = 14). Rats lived and trained in normoxia at 760 mmHg (N and NT) or hypobaric hypoxia at 550 mmHg (approximately 2,800 m) (H and HT). m-ATPase activity was measured by rapid flow quench technique; myosin subunits were analyzed with mono- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Endurance training significantly increased m-ATPase (P &lt; 0.01), although an increase in MHC-I content occurred (P &lt; 0.01). In spite of slow-to-fast transitions in MHC isoform distribution in chronic hypoxia (P &lt; 0.05) no increase in m-ATPase was observed. The rate constants of m-ATPase were 0.0350 +/- 0.0023 s(-1) and 0.047 +/- 0.0050 s(-1) for N and NT and 0.033 +/- 0.0021 s(-1) and 0.038 +/- 0.0032 s(-1) for H and HT. Thus, dissociation between variations in m-ATPase and changes in MHC isoform expression was observed. Changes in fraction of active myosin heads, in myosin light chain isoform (MLC) distribution or in MLC phosphorylation, could not explain the variations in m-ATPase. Myosin posttranslational modifications or changes in other myofibrillar proteins may therefore be responsible for the observed variations in m-ATPase activity.",M1
20483993,"Hard wiring of T cell receptor specificity for the major histocompatibility complex is underpinned by TCR adaptability.alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) are genetically restricted to corecognize peptide antigens bound to self-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules; however, the basis for this <e>MHC</e> specificity remains unclear. Despite the current dogma, evaluation of the TCR-pMHC-I structural database shows that the nongermline-encoded complementarity-determining region (CDR)-3 loops often contact the MHC-I, and the germline-encoded CDR1 and -2 loops frequently participate in peptide-mediated interactions. Nevertheless, different TCRs adopt a roughly conserved docking mode over the pMHC-I, in which three MHC-I residues (65, 69, and 155) are invariably contacted by the TCR in one way or another. Nonetheless, the impact of mutations at these three positions, either individually or together, was not uniformly detrimental to TCR recognition of pHLA-B*0801 or pHLA-B*3508. Moreover, when TCR-pMHC-I recognition was impaired, this could be partially restored by expression of the CD8 coreceptor. The structure of a TCR-pMHC-I complex in which these three (65, 69, and 155) MHC-I positions were all mutated resulted in shifting of the TCR footprint relative to the cognate complex and formation of compensatory interactions. Collectively, our findings reveal the inherent adaptability of the TCR in maintaining peptide recognition while accommodating changes to the central docking site on the pMHC-I.",M2
20461369,"Haplotype variation, recombination, and gene conversion within the turkey <e>MHC</e>-B locus.The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a gene dense region with profound effects on the disease phenotype. In many species, characterizations of MHC polymorphisms have focused on identifying allelic haplotypes of the highly polymorphic class I and class II loci through direct immunological approaches such as monoclonal antibodies specific for the major antigens or indirectly through DNA sequence-based approaches. Invariably, these studies fail to assess the broader range of variation at the other loci within the MHC. This study examines variation in the turkey MHC by resequencing 15 interspersed amplicons ( approximately 14 kb) spaced across the MHC-B locus in a representative sampling of 52 commercial birds. Over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified with high levels of polymorphism (1 SNP/70 bp) and heterozygosity (average minor allele frequency of 0.15). SNP genotypes were used to identify the major haplotypes segregating in the commercial lines. Sequencing of the peptide binding region (PBR, exon 2) of the class IIB loci of select individuals identified 10 PBR alleles/isotypes among the major MHC haplotypes. Examination of pedigreed families provides direct evidence of gene conversion and recombination within the B locus. Results of this study demonstrate the MHC diversity available in commercial flocks and provide genomic resources for studying the effect of this diversity (alleles and/or haplotypes) on disease susceptibility and resistance.",M2
20415846,"99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: triggering of autoimmune diseases by infections.Human autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), are linked genetically to distinct major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class II molecules and other immune modulators. However, genetic predisposition is only one risk factor for the development of these diseases, and low concordance rates in monozygotic twins as well as geographical distribution of disease risk suggest a critical role for environmental factors in the triggering of these autoimmune diseases. Among potential environmental factors, infections have been implicated in the onset and/or promotion of autoimmunity. This review will discuss human autoimmune diseases with a potential viral cause, and outline potential mechanisms by which pathogens can trigger autoimmune disease as discerned from various animal models of infection-induced autoimmune disease.",M2
20415816,"Genetic variations associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis found by genome-wide association.Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are immune disorders with a complex polygenic basis. HLA-Cw6, which lies in the major histocompatibility region on chromosome 6, is considered the major genetic determinant of psoriasis. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified new variants outside of the <e>MHC</e> with relevance to the immunology of psoriasis. Variants in or near genes that encode subunits of cytokines (IL12B, IL23A) or cytokine receptors (IL23R) are interesting given that the gene product of IL12B, p40, is the target of a recently approved monoclonal antibody therapy for psoriasis (ustekinumab). Association with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has been found in TNFAIP3 and TNFIP1, ubiquitin ligases in the NF-kappaB pathway, and IL13, a Th2 cytokine. Copy number variation of human beta-defensin and late cornified envelope genes also associate with psoriasis. Many of these genetic variations also associate with immune disorders considered psoriatic co-morbidities, including Crohn's disease and diabetes.",M2
20409590,"Frequent occurrence of conserved extended haplotypes (CEHs) in two Caucasian populations.Conserved extended haplotypes (CEHs) are large (&gt;or=1Mb) regions of identical DNA of the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) region of chromosome 6p in unrelated individuals. They are recognized by family studies and constitute nearly half of MHC haplotypes among European Caucasians. We studied 49 Hungarian Caucasian families in comparison with the previous findings in 2675 normal American Caucasian chromosomes from families in the Boston area. Besides HLA-A, -B and HLA-DRB1/-DQB1 alleles, copy number polymorphism of C4A and C4B genes and several SNPs encoded in the central (class III) MHC region were determined. By comparing 188 Caucasian haplotypes in Hungary to 2675 normal Caucasian chromosomes in Boston, we found that 11 of 12 of the most common CEHs (with a frequency of at least 1%) among the Boston chromosomes also occurred in Hungary. Moreover, there was a significant correlation (R=0.789; p=0.0023) in the frequency order of these haplotypes between the two Caucasian populations. Of 10 haplotypes found in &gt;or=2 copies among the Hungarian chromosomes, all but one occurred in one to 14 copies among the Boston haplotypes. These findings indicate that CEHs are commonly shared by distinct European Caucasian populations; however, lower frequency CEHs may differ.",M2
20374634,"A female signal reflects <e>MHC</e> genotype in a social primate.BACKGROUND: Males from many species are believed to advertise their genetic quality through striking ornaments that attract mates. Yet the connections between signal expression, body condition and the genes associated with individual quality are rarely elucidated. This is particularly problematic for the signals of females in species with conventional sex roles, whose evolutionary significance has received little attention and is poorly understood. Here we explore these questions in the sexual swellings of female primates, which are among the most conspicuous of mammalian sexual signals and highly variable in size, shape and colour. We investigated the relationships between two components of sexual swellings (size and shape), body condition, and genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in a wild baboon population (Papio ursinus) where males prefer large swellings. RESULTS: Although there was no effect of MHC diversity on the sexual swelling components, one specific MHC supertype (S1) was associated with poor body condition together with swellings of small size and a particular shape. The variation in swelling characteristics linked with the possession of supertype S1 appeared to be partially mediated by body condition and remained detectable when taking into account the possession of other supertypes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a pathway from immunity genes to sexual signals via physical condition for the first time in females. They further indicate that mechanisms of sexual selection traditionally assigned to males can also operate in females.",M2
20360949,"T cell-dependence of Lassa fever pathogenesis.Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), is endemic in West Africa, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality. In spite of ongoing research efforts, LF pathogenesis and mechanisms of LASV immune control remain poorly understood. While normal laboratory mice are resistant to LASV, we report that mice expressing humanized instead of murine <e>MHC</e> class I (MHC-I) failed to control LASV infection and develop severe LF. Infection of MHC-I knockout mice confirmed a key role for MHC-I-restricted T cell responses in controlling LASV. Intriguingly we found that T cell depletion in LASV-infected HHD mice prevented disease, irrespective of high-level viremia. Widespread activation of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, manifest through inducible NO synthase expression, and elevated IL-12p40 serum levels indicated a systemic inflammatory condition. The absence of extensive monocyte/macrophage activation in T cell-depleted mice suggested that T cell responses contribute to deleterious innate inflammatory reactions and LF pathogenesis. Our observations in mice indicate a dual role for T cells, not only protecting from LASV, but also enhancing LF pathogenesis. The possibility of T cell-driven enhancement and immunopathogenesis should be given consideration in future LF vaccine development.",M2
20357361,"Simultaneous detection of circulating autoreactive CD8+ T-cells specific for different islet cell-associated epitopes using combinatorial <e>MHC</e> multimers.OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes results from selective T-cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas. In this process, islet epitope-specific CD8(+) T-cells play a pivotal role. Thus, monitoring of multiple islet-specific CD8(+) T-cells may prove to be valuable for measuring disease activity, progression, and intervention. Yet, conventional detection techniques (ELISPOT and HLA tetramers) require many cells and are relatively insensitive. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we used a combinatorial quantum dot major histocompatibility complex multimer technique to simultaneously monitor the presence of HLA-A2 restricted insulin B(10-18), prepro-insulin (PPI)(15-24), islet antigen (IA)-2(797-805), GAD65(114-123), islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP)(265-273), and prepro islet amyloid polypeptide (ppIAPP)(5-13)-specific CD8(+) T-cells in recent-onset diabetic patients, their siblings, healthy control subjects, and islet cell transplantation recipients. RESULTS: Using this kit, islet autoreactive CD8(+) T-cells recognizing insulin B(10-18), IA-2(797-805), and IGRP(265-273) were shown to be frequently detectable in recent-onset diabetic patients but rarely in healthy control subjects; PPI(15-24) proved to be the most sensitive epitope. Applying the  Diab-Q-kit  to samples of islet cell transplantation recipients allowed detection of changes of autoreactive T-cell frequencies against multiple islet cell-derived epitopes that were associated with disease activity and correlated with clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A kit was developed that allows simultaneous detection of CD8(+) T-cells reactive to multiple HLA-A2-restricted beta-cell epitopes requiring limited amounts of blood, without a need for in vitro culture, that is applicable on stored blood samples.",M2
20347157,"Major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>)-mediated immune regulation of decidual leukocytes at the fetal-maternal interface.Self and non-self recognition is the key mechanism by which the immune system determines whether or not to mount an immune response. During pregnancy the maternal immune system must tolerate the persistence of non-self semi-allogeneic fetal cells in the maternal tissue. Although many mechanisms have been shown to contribute to the prevention of a destructive maternal immune response to fetal cells, the immune acceptance of the allogeneic fetus in pregnancy largely remains an immunological paradox (Billingham et al., 1953). The aim of this review is to describe the expression of the polymorphic histocompatibility antigens at the fetal-maternal interface, their interaction with maternal leukocytes and their possible roles in immune regulation at the fetal-maternal interface during human pregnancy.",M2
20308396,"Genotypes of chicken major histocompatibility complex B locus associated with regression of Rous sarcoma virus J-strain tumors.The chicken <e>MHC</e>-B locus affects the response to several strains of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). We evaluated the association between haplotypes of the MHC-B locus and responses to the J strain of RSV by using an F(2) experimental resource family constructed with tumor-regressive (White Leghorn) and tumor-progressive (Rhode Island Red) chickens. The MHC-B haplotypes were determined by genotyping of the microsatellite marker LEI0258 and MHC-B locus class I alpha chain 2 (BF2). Two haplotypes in the resource family, one associated with tumor regression and one with progression, were defined by these 2 markers. To discriminate more precisely the regressive haplotype in this family, we further developed 35 SNP markers at the MHC-B locus. Information on the haplotypes revealed here should be useful for identifying chickens with regression and progression phenotypes of J-strain RSV-induced tumors.",M2
20307209,"On the composition of the preimmune repertoire of T cells specific for Peptide-major histocompatibility complex ligands.Millions of T cells are produced in the thymus, each expressing a unique alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) capable of binding to a foreign peptide in the binding groove of a host major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) molecule. T cell-mediated immunity to infection is due to the proliferation and differentiation of rare clones in the preimmune repertoire that by chance express TCRs specific for peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands derived from the microorganism. Here we review recent findings that have altered our understanding of how the preimmune repertoire is established. Recent structural studies indicate that a germline-encoded tendency of TCRs to bind MHC molecules contributes to the MHC bias of T cell repertoires. It has also become clear that the preimmune repertoire contains functionally heterogeneous subsets including recent thymic emigrants, mature naive phenotype cells, memory phenotype cells, and natural regulatory T cells. In addition, sensitive new detection methods have revealed that the repertoire of naive phenotype T cells consists of distinct pMHC-specific populations that consistently vary in size in different individuals. The implications of these new findings for the clonal selection theory, self-tolerance, and immunodominance are discussed.",M2
20300982,"Separation of antileukemic effects from graft-versus-host disease in <e>MHC</e>-haploidentical murine bone marrow transplantation: participation of host immune cells.Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with both graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. In clinical studies of HLA-mismatched HSCT, strong GVL effects have been reported. In the present study, we addressed the mechanism of the GVL and GVH response using MHC-haploidentical murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models. Recipient BDF1 (H-2(b/d)) mice received T cell-depleted bone marrow and spleen cells from B6C3F1 (H-2(b/k)) or C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice with or without P815 mastocytoma cells (H-2(d)) after receiving lethal total body irradiation. B6C3F1 --&gt; BDF1 (hetero-to-hetero type) recipients showed more powerful antileukemic effects with less severe GVHD than C57BL/6 --&gt; BDF1 (parent-to-F1 type) recipients. Compared with C57BL/6 --&gt; BDF1 recipients, significantly higher in vitro cytotoxic activity against P815 cells was observed in B6C3F1 --&gt; BDF1 recipients. Significantly lower CXCR3 expression on donor T cells and higher interferon (IFN)-gamma expression were considered to be associated with strong antileukemic effects with less severe GVHD in B6C3F1 --&gt; BDF1 recipients. Furthermore, host immune cells, especially natural killer cells and CD8(+) T cells, were found to contribute remarkably to high IFN-gamma production in B6C3F1 --&gt; BDF1 recipients. Thus, in MHC-haploidentical HSCT, host immune cells may change the balance between GVH and GVL response through IFN-gamma production.",M2
20196809,"Beyond <e>MHC</e>: signals of elevated selection pressure on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) immune-relevant loci.Using Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as a model system, we investigated whether 18 microsatellites tightly linked to immune-relevant genes have experienced different selection pressures than 76 loci with no obvious association with immune function. Immune-relevant loci were identified as outliers by two outlier tests significantly more often than nonimmune linked loci (22% vs. 1.6%). In addition, the allele frequencies of immune relevant markers were more often correlated with latitude and temperature. Combined, these results support the hypothesis that immune-relevant loci more frequently exhibit footprints of selection than other loci. They also indicate that the correlation between immune-relevant loci and latitude may be due to temperature-induced differences in pathogen-driven selection or some other environmental factor correlated with latitude.",M2
20192999,"Genetics and genomics of ankylosing spondylitis.Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common, highly heritable arthropathy, the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. The mechanism by which the main gene for the disease, HLA-B27, leads to AS is unknown. Genetic and genomic studies have demonstrated involvement of the interleukin-23 (IL-23) signaling pathway in AS, a finding which has stimulated much new research into the disease and has led to therapeutic trials. Several other genes and genetic regions, including further major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) and non-MHC loci, have been shown to be involved in the disease, but it is not clear yet how they actually induce the condition. These findings have shown that there is a strong genetic overlap between AS and Crohn's disease in particular, although there are also major differences in the genes involved in the two conditions, presumably explaining their different presentations. Genomic and proteomic studies are in an early phase but have potential both as diagnostic/prognostic tools and as a further hypothesis-free tool to investigate AS pathogenesis. Given the slow progress in studying the mechanism of association of HLA-B27 with AS, these may prove to be more fruitful approaches to investigating the pathogenesis of the disease.",M2
20182874,"Characterization of human CD4 helper T cell responses against Aurora kinase A.Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) is a cell cycle-associated serine-threonine kinase that is overexpressed by various types of cancer and is highly associated with poor prognosis. Since the expression of Aurora-A in normal tissues has been shown to be significantly lower as compared to tumor cells, this protein is being considered as a potential tumor-associated antigen for developing immunotherapies. The goal in the present study was to identify CD4 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes for Aurora-A for the design of T cell-based immunotherapies against Aurora-A-expressing tumors. Synthetic peptides corresponding to potential HTL epitopes were identified from Aurora-A and used to stimulate CD4 T lymphocytes in vitro to generate antigen-specific HTL clones that were evaluated for antigen specificity, <e>MHC</e> restriction and for their ability to interact with Aurora-A-expressing tumor cells. The results show that two peptides (Aurora-A(161-175) and Aurora-A(233-247)) were effective in generating HTL responses that were restricted by more than one MHC class II allele (i.e., promiscuous responses). The CD4 HTL clones were able to directly recognize Aurora-A-expressing tumor cells in an antigen-specific and MHC class II-restricted manner and some of the clones displayed cytolytic activity toward Aurora-A + tumor cells. Both of these peptides were capable of stimulating in vitro T cell responses in patients with bladder cancer.",M2
20178121,"Epstein-Barr virus promotes interferon-alpha production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.OBJECTIVE: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as demonstrated by the presence of increased seroprevalence and elevated viral loads, but the mechanism of this linkage has not been elucidated. Increased interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) levels and signatures, which are associated with innate immune responses, have been found in patients with SLE. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are innate immune cells that mediate viral immunity by producing large quantities of IFNalpha, but the role they play during infection with EBV remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the ability of EBV to promote IFNalpha production by PDCs in healthy subjects. METHODS: Human PDCs were sorted and cultured in the presence of EBV, EBV-encoded RNA, and EBV double-stranded DNA. IFNalpha production by PDCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with the activation of these cells measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that EBV DNA and RNA promoted IFNalpha production by human PDCs through engagement of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) and TLR-7, respectively, with the initial viral recognition by PDCs mediated by binding to class II major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) molecules. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that class II MHC-specific engagement by virus, with subsequent viral nucleic acid recognition, mediates IFNalpha production by PDCs. Our results suggest that elevated levels of IFNalpha found in SLE patients may be a result of aberrantly controlled chronic viral infection.",M2
20177343,"Tolerance and long-lasting peripheral chimerism after allogeneic intestinal transplantation in MGH miniature swine.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinical intestinal transplantation (Int-Tx) is limited by high rates of rejection, infection, and graft versus host disease. To improve clinical outcomes and eliminate the comorbidities associated with chronic immunosuppression, the induction of donor-specific tolerance to intestinal grafts is desirable, especially in the pediatric population. This study determined the ability of intestinal grafts to facilitate tolerance induction in major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>)-inbred miniature swine. METHODS: Seven MGH-miniature swine received heterotopic intestinal grafts, two across MHC-matched, minor-antigen disparities, three across a class I MHC disparity with 12 days of cyclosporine A, and two across a class I MHC disparity without an immunosuppressant. Chimerism was assessed by FACS analysis and immunohistochemistry. Cell-mediated lympholysis assays were used to assess antidonor responses. RESULTS: Two animals receiving intestinal grafts without an immunosuppressant developed antidonor IgG in 14 days and rejected these completely. All other grafts were accepted with 12 days of cyclosporine A across both MHC-matched and MHC class I barriers. Cell-mediated lympholysis assays showed donor-specific unresponsiveness by day 30 across MHC class I barriers. Greater than 15% peripheral donor cell chimerism persisted for more than 60 days after MHC-matched Int-Tx. Although less than 1.5% peripheral donor cell chimerism was seen during the maintenance period after class I-mismatched Int-Tx, 5% to 10% myeloid chimerism was found in the peripheral blood 14 to 90 days after Int-Tx. FACS analysis demonstrated that 1% to 2% of lymphocytes in the graft mesenteric lymph nodes were CD4/CD25(HIGH+)/Foxp3(+) cells. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of tolerance induction and persistence of chimerism in a large animal intestinal transplant model.",M2
20176734,"Comparative genetic analysis of inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes implicates multiple loci with opposite effects.Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are autoimmune diseases that may share common susceptibility pathways. We examined known susceptibility loci for these diseases in a cohort of 1689 CD cases, 777 UC cases, 989 T1D cases and 6197 shared control subjects of European ancestry, who were genotyped by the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP arrays. We identified multiple previously unreported or unconfirmed disease associations, including known CD loci (ICOSLG and TNFSF15) and T1D loci (TNFAIP3) that confer UC risk, known UC loci (HERC2 and IL26) that confer T1D risk and known UC loci (IL10 and CCNY) that confer CD risk. Additionally, we show that T1D risk alleles residing at the PTPN22, IL27, IL18RAP and IL10 loci protect against CD. Furthermore, the strongest risk alleles for T1D within the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) confer strong protection against CD and UC; however, given the multi-allelic nature of the MHC haplotypes, sequencing of the MHC locus will be required to interpret this observation. These results extend our current knowledge on genetic variants that predispose to autoimmunity, and suggest that many loci involved in autoimmunity may be under a balancing selection due to antagonistic pleiotropic effect. Our analysis implies that variants with opposite effects on different diseases may facilitate the maintenance of common susceptibility alleles in human populations, making autoimmune diseases especially amenable to genetic dissection by genome-wide association studies.",M2

20151417,"MM-GBSA binding free energy decomposition and T cell receptor engineering.Recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR) of immunogenic peptides (p) presented by class I major histocompatibility complexes (<e>MHC</e>) is the key event in the immune response against virus infected cells or tumor cells. The major determinant of T cell activation is the affinity of the TCR for the peptide-MHC complex, though kinetic parameters are also important. A study of the 2C TCR/SIYR/H-2Kb system using a binding free energy decomposition (BFED) based on the MM-GBSA approach had been performed to assess the performance of the approach on this system. The results showed that the TCR-p-MHC BFED including entropic terms provides a detailed and reliable description of the energetics of the interaction (Zoete and Michielin, 2007). Based on these results, we have developed a new approach to design sequence modifications for a TCR recognizing the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 restricted tumor epitope NY-ESO-1. NY-ESO-1 is a cancer testis antigen expressed not only in melanoma, but also on several other types of cancers. It has been observed at high frequencies in melanoma patients with unusually positive clinical outcome and, therefore, represents an interesting target for adoptive transfer with modified TCR. Sequence modifications of TCR potentially increasing the affinity for this epitope have been proposed and tested in vitro. T cells expressing some of the proposed TCR mutants showed better T cell functionality, with improved killing of peptide-loaded T2 cells and better proliferative capacity compared to the wild type TCR expressing cells. These results open the door of rational TCR design for adoptive transfer cancer therapy.",M2
20128646,"The role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in retinal pigment epithelial cell-mediated immune modulation.PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO) in human retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE)-mediated immune modulation. METHODS: The immunosuppression of cultured human RPEs (ARPE-19 cells) was assayed using the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) harvested from CBA/J and BALB/c mice. The expression of critical immune modulatory molecules, such as class II major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) molecules, co-stimulatory molecules (B7-1 and B7-2), and indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO), was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining with and without IFN-gamma stimulation. RESULTS: RPEs expressed IDO and class II MHC molecules under IFN-gamma stimulation. However, B7-1 and B7-2 were not expressed. RPE significantly suppressed MLR in the absence of IFN-gamma prestimulation. This phenomenon was enhanced by IFN-gamma stimulation. The addition of 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT) into the culture medium successfully reversed RPE immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of IDO may in part explain RPE-mediated immune suppression effects.",M2
20128139,"Sporadic inclusion body myositis: variability in prevalence and phenotype and influence of the <e>MHC</e>.Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common myopathy presenting over the age of 40 years but its prevalence varies considerably in different populations. Genetic factors play a part in the pathogenesis of sIBM and in Caucasians susceptibility has been linked to the HLA-DR3 allele and the 8.1 MHC ancestral haplotype (AH) which is also associated with other autoimmune diseases. The variable prevalence of sIBM in different populations may be related to differences in the population frequency of this haplotype. Our recent observations indicate that the clinical phenotype at presentation is also quite variable and that the influence of the MHC is more complex than previously appreciated with HLA alleles also having modifying effects on the age-at-onset, severity and rate of progression of the disease. Recent recombinant mapping studies of polymorphisms in the Class II/III regions of the MHC by our group have further refined the susceptibility region and have identified a number of candidate genes warranting further investigation. The significance of these findings for the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed.",M2
20109187,"Acute paretic syndrome in juvenile White Leghorn chickens resembles late stages of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies in humans.BACKGROUND: Sudden limb paresis is a common problem in White Leghorn flocks, affecting about 1% of the chicken population before achievement of sexual maturity. Previously, a similar clinical syndrome has been reported as being caused by inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerve fibres. Here, we investigated in detail the immunopathology of this paretic syndrome and its possible resemblance to human neuropathies. METHODS: Neurologically affected chickens and control animals from one single flock underwent clinical and neuropathological examination. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) alterations were characterised using standard morphological techniques, including nerve fibre teasing and transmission electron microscopy. Infiltrating cells were phenotyped immunohistologically and quantified by flow cytometry. The cytokine expression pattern was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These investigations were accomplished by <e>MHC</e> genotyping and a PCR screen for Marek's disease virus (MDV). RESULTS: Spontaneous paresis of White Leghorns is caused by cell-mediated, inflammatory demyelination affecting multiple cranial and spinal nerves and nerve roots with a proximodistal tapering. Clinical manifestation coincides with the employment of humoral immune mechanisms, enrolling plasma cell recruitment, deposition of myelin-bound IgG and antibody-dependent macrophageal myelin-stripping. Disease development was significantly linked to a 539 bp microsatellite in MHC locus LEI0258. An aetiological role for MDV was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The paretic phase of avian inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis immunobiologically resembles the late-acute disease stages of human acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and is characterised by a Th1-to-Th2 shift.",M2
20090908,"Manipulating IL-2 availability amid presentation of donor <e>MHC</e> antigens suppresses murine alloimmune responses by inducing regulatory T cells.BACKGROUND: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are important for alloimmune responses as well as immune tolerance. Previous studies have shown that presentation of donor MHC antigens by donor-specific transfusion prior to or upon transplantation promotes transplant tolerance induced by other agents. However, it is unclear whether presentation of donor MHC antigens by DNA vaccination induces long-term allograft survival. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated whether presentation of MHC class-II and/or class-I donor antigens by DNA vaccination suppresses alloimmune responses and promotes long-term allograft acceptance. We initially found that presentation of both MHC donor antigens by DNA vaccination itself prior to transplantation fails to significantly prolong islet allograft survival in otherwise untreated mice. However, islet allograft survival was significantly prolonged when MHC class-II DNA vaccination was accompanied with IL-2 administration (MHCII + IL-2) while MHC class-I DNA vaccination was followed by IL-2 and subsequent neutralizing anti-IL-2 treatments (MHCI + IL-2/anti-IL-2). Especially, this protocol promoted long-term allograft survival in the majority of recipients (57%) when combined with low doses of rapamycin post-transplantation. Importantly, MHCII + IL-2 induced FoxP3+ Treg cells in both spleens and grafts and suppressed graft-infiltrating CD4+ cell proliferation, whereas MHCI + IL-2/anti-IL-2 mainly inhibited graft-infiltrating CD8+ cell proliferation and donor-specific CTL activity. The combined protocol plus rapamycin treatment further reduced both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation as well as donor-specific CTL activity but spared FoxP3+ Treg cells. Depleting CD25+ Treg cells or adoptive transfer of pre-sensitized CD8+ T cells abolished this long-term allograft survival. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Manipulating IL-2 availability during presentation of MHC class-II and class-I donor antigens by DNA vaccination pre-transplantation induces Treg cells, suppresses alloimmune responses and promotes long-term allograft survival.",M2

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes as susceptible markers in the risk of type 1 diabetes in the Estonian population. Methods: The rs6679677 (1p13), rs17696736 (12q24) and rs763361 (18q22) were genotyped in a total of 230 controls and 154 type 1 diabetes patients of Estonian origin.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the major findings of these studies, and the answers they provide and questions they raise about the pathogenesis of this common condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Five genes/genetic regions have now definitively been associated with AS [the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>), IL23R, ERAP1, 2p15 and 21q22]. Strong evidence to support association with the disease has been demonstrated for the genes IL1R2, ANTXR2, TNFSF15, TNFR1 and a region on chromosome 16q including the gene TRADD. There is an overrepresentation of genes involved in Th17 lymphocyte differentiation/activation among genes associated with AS and the related diseases inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, pointing strongly to this pathway as playing a major causative role in the disease. Increasing information about differential association of HLA-B27 subtypes with disease suggests a hierarchy of strength of association of those alleles with AS, providing a useful test as to the validity of different potential mechanisms of association of HLA-B27 with AS. The mechanism underlying the association of the gene deserts, 2p15 and 21q22, suggests the involvement of noncoding RNA in AS etiopathogenesis. SUMMARY: The increasing list of genes identified as being definitely involved in AS provides a useful platform for hypothesis-driven research in the field, providing a potential alternative route to determining the underlying mechanisms involved in the disease to research focusing on HLA-B27 alone.",M2
20078764,"Pathogens as potential selective agents in the wild.Pathogens are considered a serious threat to which wild populations must adapt, most particularly under conditions of rapid environmental change. One way host adaptation has been studied is through genetic population structure at the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>), a complex of adaptive genes involved in pathogen resistance in vertebrates. However, while associations between specific pathogens and MHC alleles or diversity have been documented from laboratory studies, the interaction between hosts and pathogens in the wild is more complex. As such, identifying selective agents and understanding underlying co-evolutionary mechanisms remains a major challenge. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Evans &amp; Neff (2009) characterized spatial and temporal variation in the bacterial parasite community infecting Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry from five populations in British Columbia, Canada. They used a 16S rDNA sequencing-based approach to examine the prevalence of bacterial infection in kidney and looked for associations with MHC class I and II genetic variability. The authors found a high diversity of bacteria infecting fry, albeit at low prevalence. It was reasoned that spatial variability in infection rate and bacterial community phylogenetic similarity found across populations may represent differential pathogen-mediated selection pressures. The study revealed some evidence of heterozygote advantage at MHC class II, but not class I, and preliminary associations between specific MHC alleles and bacterial infections were uncovered. This research adds an interesting perspective to the debate on host-pathogen co-evolutionary mechanisms and emphasizes the importance of considering the complexity of pathogen communities in studies of host local adaptation.",M2
20075022,"T-cell antagonism by short half-life pMHC ligands can be mediated by an efficient trapping of T-cell polarization toward the APC.T-cell activation results from productive T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement by a cognate peptide-<e>MHC</e> (pMHC) complex on the antigen presenting cell (APC) surface, a process leading to the polarization of the T-cell secretory machinery toward the APC interface. We have previously shown that the half-life of the TCR/pMHC interaction and the density of pMHC on the APC are two parameters determining T-cell activation. However, whether the half-life of the TCR/pMHC interaction can modulate the efficiency of T-cell secretory machinery polarization toward an APC still remains unclear. Here, by using altered peptide ligands conferring different half-lives to the TCR/pMHC interaction, we have tested how this parameter can control T-cell polarization. We observed that only TCR/pMHC interactions with intermediate half-lives can promote the assembly of synapses that lead to T-cell activation. Strikingly, intermediate half-life interactions can be competed out by short half-life interactions, which can efficiently promote T-cell polarization and antagonize T-cell activation that was induced by activating intermediate half-life interactions. However, short TCR/pMHC interactions fail at promoting phosphorylation of signaling molecules at the T-cell-APC contact interface, which are needed for T-cell activation. Our data suggest that although intermediate half-life pMHC ligands promote assembly of activating synapses, this process can be inhibited by short half-life antagonistic pMHC ligands, which promote the assembly of non activating synapses.",M2
20074317,"<e>MHC</e> diversity and differential exposure to pathogens in kestrels (Aves: Falconidae).Pathogen diversity is thought to drive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism given that host's immune repertories are dependent on antigen recognition capabilities. Here, we surveyed an extensive community of pathogens (n = 35 taxa) and MHC diversity in mainland versus island subspecies of the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus and in a sympatric mainland population of the phylogenetically related lesser kestrel Falco naumanni. Insular subspecies are commonly exposed to impoverished pathogen communities whilst different species' ecologies and contrasting life-history traits may lead to different levels of pathogen exposure. Although specific host traits may explain differential particular infections, overall pathogen diversity, richness and prevalence were higher in the truly cosmopolitan, euriphagous and long-distance disperser Eurasian kestrel than in the estenophagous, steppe-specialist, philopatric but long-distance migratory lesser kestrel. Accordingly, the continental population of Eurasian kestrels displayed a higher number (64 vs. 49) as well as more divergent alleles at both MHC class I and class II loci. Detailed analyses of amino acid diversity revealed that significant differences between both species were exclusive to those functionally important codons comprising the antigen binding sites. The lowest pathogen burdens and the smallest but still quite divergent set of MHC alleles (n = 16) were found in island Eurasian kestrels, where the rates of allele fixation at MHC loci seem to have occurred faster than at neutral markers. The results presented in this study would therefore support the role of pathogen diversity and abundance in shaping patterns of genetic variation at evolutionary relevant MHC genes.",M2
20071384,"How pathogens drive genetic diversity: <e>MHC</e>, mechanisms and misunderstandings.Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been put forward as a model for studying how genetic diversity is maintained in wild populations. Pathogen-mediated selection (PMS) is believed to generate the extraordinary levels of MHC diversity observed. However, establishing the relative importance of the three proposed mechanisms of PMS (heterozygote advantage, rare-allele advantage and fluctuating selection) has proved extremely difficult. Studies have attempted to differentiate between mechanisms of PMS using two approaches: (i) comparing MHC diversity with that expected under neutrality and (ii) relating MHC diversity to pathogen regime. Here, we show that in many cases the same predictions arise from the different mechanisms under these approaches, and that most studies that have inferred one mechanism of selection have not fully considered the alternative explanations. We argue that, while it may be possible to demonstrate that particular mechanisms of PMS are occurring, resolving their relative importance within a system is probably impossible. A more realistic target is to continue to demonstrate when and where the different mechanisms of PMS occur, with the aim of determining their relative importance across systems. We put forward what we believe to be the most promising approaches that will allow us to progress towards achieving this.",M2
20062062,"Genome-wide association study of ankylosing spondylitis identifies non-<e>MHC</e> susceptibility loci.To identify susceptibility loci for ankylosing spondylitis, we undertook a genome-wide association study in 2,053 unrelated ankylosing spondylitis cases among people of European descent and 5,140 ethnically matched controls, with replication in an independent cohort of 898 ankylosing spondylitis cases and 1,518 controls. Cases were genotyped with Illumina HumHap370 genotyping chips. In addition to strong association with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC; P &lt; 10(-800)), we found association with SNPs in two gene deserts at 2p15 (rs10865331; combined P = 1.9 x 10(-19)) and 21q22 (rs2242944; P = 8.3 x 10(-20)), as well as in the genes ANTXR2 (rs4333130; P = 9.3 x 10(-8)) and IL1R2 (rs2310173; P = 4.8 x 10(-7)). We also replicated previously reported associations at IL23R (rs11209026; P = 9.1 x 10(-14)) and ERAP1 (rs27434; P = 5.3 x 10(-12)). This study reports four genetic loci associated with ankylosing spondylitis risk and identifies a major role for the interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-1 cytokine pathways in disease susceptibility.",M2
20058003,"Major histocompatibility complex variation and evolution  at a single, expressed DQA locus in two genera of elephants.Genes of the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) are crucial to defense against infectious disease, provide an important measure of functional genetic diversity, and have been implicated in mate choice and kin recognition. As a result, MHC loci have been characterized for a number of vertebrate species, especially mammals;however, elephants are a notable exception. Our study is the first to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and natural selection in the elephant MHC. We did so using DNA sequences from a single, expressed DQA locus in elephants.We characterized six alleles in 30 African elephants(Loxodonta africana) and four alleles in three Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). In addition, for two of the African alleles and three of the Asian alleles, we characterized complete coding sequences (exons 1-5) and nearly complete non-coding sequences (introns 2-4) for the class II DQA loci. Compared to DQA in other wild mammals, we found moderate polymorphism and allelic diversity and similar patterns of selection; patterns of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were consistent with balancing selection acting on the peptides involved in antigen binding in the second exon. In addition, balancing selection has led to strong trans-species allelism that has maintained multiple allelic lineages across both genera of extant elephants for at least 6 million years. We discuss our results in the context of MHC diversity in other mammals and patterns of evolution in elephants.",M2
20047645,"Evolutionary history of DLA class II haplotypes in canine diabetes mellitus through single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping.Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a characteristic of the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) region, as well as the genome in general in dogs as a consequence of demographic changes with domestication. Disease association studies of MHC haplotypes may be affected by high LD and the resultant shared genetic backgrounds of haplotypes giving associations with linked but non-causative mutations, and also by convergent haplotypes, in which combinations of alleles have arisen independently. This study provides preliminary tools for dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotype analysis with 102 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in 14.6 kb and genotyping of 20 of these SNPs to tag haplotypes in 60 dogs with diabetes mellitus and in 49 non-diabetic dogs. The pattern of LD and analysis of SNP patterns indicated combinations of exon 2 alleles have arisen through both recombination and convergence. For exon 2 haplotypes associated with susceptibility or protection from diabetes mellitus, a region of fixed differences in SNPs across the DQ region was observed, suggesting a region outside exon 2 may be implicated in disease association. Four new DQB1 promoter alleles restricted to diabetic dogs were identified, as well as a substitution difference in the X1 box of the DQB1 promoter that will potentially modify the effect of the protective haplotypes within diabetic dogs.",M2
20047640,"Recent advances on the non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I HLA-G molecule.The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G non-classical major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I molecule was originally described in first-trimester trophoblasts at the fetal-maternal interface in 1990. Eight years later, the First International Conference on this molecule was inaugurated by Prof Jean Dausset, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The Fifth International Conference on HLA-G, held in Paris on July 2009, began with a tribute to Prof Jean Dausset who left us recently. This conference was co-chaired by Dr Edgardo D. Carosella and Prof Hans Grosse-Wilde, included 57 oral presentations and was attended by approximately 140 delegates from 16 countries. We summarize here the major advances on the HLA-G molecule that were reported, including findings on its biological activity and characterization of new mechanisms of action, notably through mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory cells, and the previously unexplored role of HLA-G on immune cells such as gammadelta T-cells and B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the role of HLA-G during pregnancy was revisited and its impact in pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune disorders and transplantation was further extended.",M2
20041166,"Common genetic variation and the control of HIV-1 in humans.To extend the understanding of host genetic determinants of HIV-1 control, we performed a genome-wide association study in a cohort of 2,554 infected Caucasian subjects. The study was powered to detect common genetic variants explaining down to 1.3% of the variability in viral load at set point. We provide overwhelming confirmation of three associations previously reported in a genome-wide study and show further independent effects of both common and rare variants in the Major Histocompatibility Complex region (<e>MHC</e>). We also examined the polymorphisms reported in previous candidate gene studies and fail to support a role for any variant outside of the MHC or the chemokine receptor cluster on chromosome 3. In addition, we evaluated functional variants, copy-number polymorphisms, epistatic interactions, and biological pathways. This study thus represents a comprehensive assessment of common human genetic variation in HIV-1 control in Caucasians.",M2
20035931,"Thymic nurse cells exhibit epithelial progenitor phenotype and create unique extra-cytoplasmic membrane space for thymocyte selection.Thymic nurse cells (TNCs) are epithelial cells in the thymic cortex that contain as many as 50 thymocytes within specialized cytoplasmic vacuoles. The function of this cell-in-cell interaction has created controversy since their discovery in 1980. Further, some skepticism exists about the idea that apoptotic thymocytes within the TNC complex result from negative selection, a process believed to occur exclusively within the medulla. In this report, we have microscopic evidence that defines a unique membranous environment wherein lipid raft aggregates around the alphabetaTCR expressed on captured thymocytes and class II <e>MHC</e> molecules expressed on TNCs. Further, immunohistological examination of thymic sections show TNCs located within the cortico-medullary junction to express cytokeratins five and eight (K5 and K8), and the transcription factor Trp-63, the phenotype defined elsewhere as the thymic epithelial progenitor subset. Our results suggest that the microenvironment provided by TNCs plays an important role in thymocyte selection as well as the potential for TNCs to be involved in the maintenance of thymic epithelia.",M2
20033850,"Estimating design space available for polyepitopes through consideration of major histocompatibility complex binding motifs.Major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e> ) epitope presentation is needed for robust adaptive immune responses. Core peptide binding motifs for class I and class II MHC are 8-10 amino acids long, containing two or more  anchor  residues. These binding motifs define epitope anchor amino acid content and spacing, and knowledge of them has facilitated emergence of polyepitope vaccines. However, polyepitopes can exhibit  junctional epitopes  (neoepitopes interfering with vaccine function) resulting from juxtaposition of authentic epitopes. We have developed an algorithm for consideration of polyepitope sequence in light of MHC motifs to exhaustively identify all junctional-free polyepitope designs for any given set of authentic epitopes, and in so doing discovered that the number of such variants of any given polyepitope can be astronomically high. Our approach designs polyepitopes of any length, considers multiple MHC class I or class II motifs simultaneously and can be adapted to design variants of existing proteins with pre-selected epitope contents. We have also implemented the algorithm as a computer-based tool (CANVAC II), which we make available to interested parties. The vast diversity of junctional-free polyepitopes suggests that the number of potential T-helper epitope free protein variants may also be large, which may have implications for discovery of bioactive but non-immunogenic therapeutics.",M2
20025042,"Characterization of human papillomavirus type 11-specific immune responses in a preclinical model.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 are associated with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Although a prophylactic vaccine has been developed that protects against HPV infection, a therapeutic vaccine is still needed for those patients infected with and/or suffering from persistent disease. Therefore, we developed a novel, therapeutic DNA vaccine targeting HPV-11 and characterized the in vivo immunologic responses generated against HPV-11 E6 and E7 after DNA vaccination in a preclinical model. METHODS: We generated a DNA vaccine that encodes the HPV-11 E6 and E7 genes in a pcDNA3 backbone plasmid. We then vaccinated C57BL/6 mice with the pcDNA3-HPV11-E6E7 DNA plasmid. Splenocytes were harvested from these vaccinated animals and were incubated with overlapping peptides spanning either the HPV-11 E6 or E7 protein. The frequency of interferon-gamma-releasing CD8(+) T cell responses was then analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Vaccinated mice with the HPV11-E6E7 DNA generated strong CD8(+) T cell responses against the E6(aa44-51) peptide. We determined that the epitope is presented by the <e>MHC</e> class I H2-K(b) molecule. No significant E7 peptide-specific T cell responses were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel DNA vaccine that targets the E6 gene of HPV-11. Characterization of the immunologic responses elicited by this DNA vaccine reveals that the E6(aa44-51) peptide contains the most immunogenic region for the HPV-11 viral type. Knowledge of this specific T cell epitope and generation of a RRP preclinical model will allow for the development and evaluation of novel vaccine strategies targeting the RRP patient population.",M2

In this report, we show that strong alloreactive responses of transgenic T cells against targets with low <e>MHC</e> class I expression can be used for effective adoptive transfer of tumor immunity in vivo.

20019647,"Natural killer cell activation in the lung allograft early posttransplantation.BACKGROUND: In addition to their known antiviral and host defense functions, emerging evidence suggests that natural killer (NK) cells may influence allograft outcomes after solid organ transplantation. Although it is accepted that NK cells are activated in the absence of self-major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I molecules, little is known of how NK cell dynamics change after transplantation of a MHC disparate lung allograft. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess this, we characterized longitudinal changes in NK cell frequency and phenotype, using flow cytometry, both in the peripheral blood and lung allograft in 34 patients undergoing lung transplantation. RESULTS: NK cell frequency decreased with time from transplant with mature NK cells being replaced by a population of less differentiated NK cells expressing lower levels of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. In contrast to peripheral blood, NK cells within the allograft consisted of a greater proportion of CD56 cells, expressed less killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, and demonstrated an activated phenotype. In clinically stable recipients, peripheral blood NK cells were not activated, however, this contrasted markedly with a small subset of patients experiencing acute allograft rejection or cytomegalovirus reactivation, whose NK cells demonstrated a more activated profile. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that NK cells become activated after MHC-mismatched lung transplantation.",M2

20012559,"Implications of available design space for identification of non-immunogenic protein therapeutics.Immunogenicity/antibody responses are major issues for parenteral proteins and nanotherapeutics (nanovectors, diagnostics, theranostics, etc.), and robust antibody responses require T-helper epitopes. T-helper epitopes consist of specific amino acids at specific positions (anchor positions) in immunogens which contact the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>), provide most of the energy for MHC binding and constitute the binding motif for the corresponding MHC alleles. We developed an algorithm that considers motifs to design vaccines lacking unwanted T-cell epitopes, and found numbers of such vaccines can be astronomical (Lee et al. 2009). The algorithm can be used to design reduced immunogenicity proteins, and numbers of predicted proteins are also immense. Reducing T-helper epitope content reduces protein immunogenicity, but the depth of mutagensis needed to eliminate immunogenicity is commonly assumed to be too great for retention of protein bioactivity. However, very deep, but successful substitution, insertion and deletion mutagenesis have been reported. These reports and design space the algorithm reveals suggest development of non-immunogenic therapeutics might be more feasible than commonly assumed.",M2
20012395,"Development of novel major histocompatibility complex class I and class II-deficient NOD-SCID IL2R gamma chain knockout mice for modeling human xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease.Immunodeficient mice have been used as recipients of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for in vivo analyses of human xeno-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This xeno-GVHD model system in many ways mimics the human disease. The model system is established by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of human PBMC or spleen cells into unconditioned or irradiated immunodeficient recipient mice. Recently, the development of several stocks of immunodeficient Prkdc ( scid ) (scid) and recombination activating 1 or 2 gene (Rag1 or Rag2) knockout mice bearing a targeted mutation in the gene encoding the IL2 receptor gamma chain (IL2rgamma) have been reported. The addition of the mutated IL2rgamma gene onto an immunodeficient mouse stock facilitates heightened engraftment with human PBMC. Stocks of mice with mutations in the IL2rgamma gene have been studied in several laboratories on NOD-scid, NOD-Rag1 ( null ), BALB/c-Rag1 ( null ), BALB/c-Rag2 ( null ), and Stock-H2(d)-Rag2 ( null ) strain backgrounds. Parameters to induce human xeno-GVHD in H2(d)-Rag2 ( null ) IL2rgamma ( null ) mice have been published, but variability in the frequency of disease and kinetics of GVHD were observed. The availability of the NOD-scid IL2rgamma ( null ) stock that engrafts more readily with human PBMC than does the Stock-H2(d)-Rag2 ( null ) IL2rgamma ( null ) stock should lead to a more reproducible humanized mouse model of GVHD and for the use in drug evaluation and validation. Furthermore, GVHD in human PBMC-engrafted scid mice has been postulated to result predominately from a human anti-mouse major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class II reactivity. Our recent development of NOD-scid IL2rgamma ( null ) beta2m ( null ) and NOD-scid IL2rgamma ( null ) Ab ( null ) stocks of mice now make it possible to investigate directly the role of host MHC class I and class II in the pathogenesis of GVHD in humanized mice using NOD-scid IL2rgamma ( null ) stocks that engraft at high levels with human PBMC and are deficient in murine MHC class I, class II, or both classes of MHC molecules.",M2
20004369,"Xenoreactivity of human clonal mesenchymal stem cells in a major histocompatibility complex-matched allogeneic graft-versus-host disease mouse model.Effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been actively investigated since the discovery of the immunomodulation property of MSCs about a decade ago. Human clonal MSCs (hcMSCs) were isolated from human bone marrow aspirate according to our newly established isolation protocol called subfractionation culturing method, and were evaluated for their efficacy on GVHD treatment, using a mouse <e>MHC</e>-matched B6--&gt;BALB.B GVHD model system. Although the hcMSCs can suppress the allogeneic proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in in vitro, the administration of the hcMSCs failed to reduce the GVHD-related mortality of the murine recipients. One of the reasons might be that murine cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cannot activate the hcMSCs. Based on these results, we suggest that xenogeneic MSCs may not be used for the treatment of GVHD.",M2
19956609,"Integrating in silico and in vitro analysis of peptide binding affinity to HLA-Cw*0102: a bioinformatic approach to the prediction of new epitopes.BACKGROUND: Predictive models of peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (<e>MHC</e>) binding affinity are important components of modern computational immunovaccinology. Here, we describe the development and deployment of a reliable peptide-binding prediction method for a previously poorly-characterized human MHC class I allele, HLA-Cw*0102. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Using an in-house, flow cytometry-based MHC stabilization assay we generated novel peptide binding data, from which we derived a precise two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) binding model. This allowed us to explore the peptide specificity of HLA-Cw*0102 molecule in detail. We used this model to design peptides optimized for HLA-Cw*0102-binding. Experimental analysis showed these peptides to have high binding affinities for the HLA-Cw*0102 molecule. As a functional validation of our approach, we also predicted HLA-Cw*0102-binding peptides within the HIV-1 genome, identifying a set of potent binding peptides. The most affine of these binding peptides was subsequently determined to be an epitope recognized in a subset of HLA-Cw*0102-positive individuals chronically infected with HIV-1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A functionally-validated in silico-in vitro approach to the reliable and efficient prediction of peptide binding to a previously uncharacterized human MHC allele HLA-Cw*0102 was developed. This technique is generally applicable to all T cell epitope identification problems in immunology and vaccinology.",M2

In this study, we revisit this issue using vaccinia virus (VACV), which has a large genome, a recently defined immunodominance hierarchy in mice, and is a candidate vector for vaccines. We found that immunogenicity of VACV peptides defined using inbred mice was highly variable in F(1) progeny: some peptides were equally immunogenic in F(1) and inbred, whereas others elicited responses that were reduced by &gt;90% in F(1) mice. Furthermore, the dominance of a peptide in the relevant inbred parent did not predict whether it would be poorly immunogenic in F(1) mice. This result held using F(1) hybrids of <e>MHC</e>-congenic mice, suggesting that MHC differences alone were responsible. It was also extended to foreign epitopes expressed by an rVACV vaccine. F(1) mice were less able to mount responses to the poorly immunogenic peptides when used as a sole immunogen, ruling out immunodomination. In addition, conserved TCR Vbeta usage between inbred and F(1) mice did not always correlate with strong responses in F(1) mice. However, direct estimation of naive precursor numbers showed that these were reduced in F(1) compared with inbred mice for specificities that were poorly immunogenic in the hybrids. These data have implications for our understanding of the extent to which MHC diversity alters the range of epitopes that are immunogenic in outbred populations.",M2
19948006,"Efficient internalization of <e>MHC</e> I requires lysine-11 and lysine-63 mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains.The downregulation of cell surface receptors by endocytosis is a fundamental requirement for the termination of signalling responses and ubiquitination is a critical regulatory step in receptor regulation. The K5 gene product of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates and downregulates several cell surface immunoreceptors, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here, we show that K5 targets the membrane proximal lysine of MHC I for conjugation with mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed an increase in lysine-11, as well as lysine-63, linked polyubiquitin chains on MHC I in K5-expressing cells. Using a combination of mutant ubiquitins and MHC I molecules expressing a single cytosolic lysine residue, we confirm a functional role for lysines-11 and -63 in K5-mediated MHC I endocytosis. We show that lysine-11 linkages are important for receptor endocytosis, and that complex mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains are generated in vivo.",M2

Furthermore, the association of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with disease-related parameters was evaluated, using alleles of the LEI0258 microsatellite as markers for MHC haplotypes. The Ri chickens were found to be more resistant to A. galli and S. Enteritidis than commercial Luong Phuong chickens. In contrast, the Ri chickens were more susceptible to P. multocida, although production parameters were more affected in the Luong Phuong chickens. Furthermore, it was shown that the individual variations observed in response to the infections were influenced by the MHC. Using marker alleles of the microsatellite LEI0258, which is located within the MHC region, several MHC haplotypes were identified as being associated with infection intensity of A. galli. An association of the MHC with the specific antibody response to S. Enteritidis was also found where four MHC haplotypes were shown to be associated with high specific antibody response. Finally, one MHC haplotype was identified as being associated with pathological lesions and mortality in the P. multocida experiment. Although not statistically significant, our analysis suggested that this haplotype might be associated with resistance. These results demonstrate the presence of local genetic resources in Vietnamese chickens, which could be utilized in breeding programmes aiming at improving disease resistance.",M2

Although previous studies have indicated that there is a genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, the genes influencing susceptibility to the disease have not been fully determined. To identify genetic factors conferring risk of ulcerative colitis, here we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study and subsequent replication study using 1,384 Japanese individuals with ulcerative colitis and 3,057 control subjects. In addition to the expected strong association with the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) region, we identified three new susceptibility loci: the immunoglobulin receptor gene FCGR2A (rs1801274, P = 1.56 x 10(-12)), a locus on chromosome 13q12 (rs17085007, P = 6.64 x 10(-8)) and the glycoprotein gene SLC26A3 (rs2108225, P = 9.50 x 10(-8)). rs1801274 is a nonsynonymous SNP of FCGR2A that is reported to have a critical effect on receptor binding affinity for IgG and to be associated with other autoimmune diseases.

19915060,"<e>MHC</e> drives TCR repertoire shaping, but not maturation, in recent thymic emigrants.After developing in the thymus, recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) enter the lymphoid periphery and undergo a maturation process as they transition into the mature naive (MN) T cell compartment. This maturation presumably shapes RTEs into a pool of T cells best fit to function robustly in the periphery without causing autoimmunity; however, the mechanism and consequences of this maturation process remain unknown. Using a transgenic mouse system that specifically labels RTEs, we tested the influence of MHC molecules, key drivers of intrathymic T cell selection and naive peripheral T cell homeostasis, in shaping the RTE pool in the lymphoid periphery. We found that the TCRs expressed by RTEs are skewed to longer CDR3 regions compared with those of MN T cells, suggesting that MHC does streamline the TCR repertoire of T cells as they transition from the RTE to the MN T cell stage. This conclusion is borne out in studies in which the representation of individual TCRs was followed as a function of time since thymic egress. Surprisingly, we found that MHC is dispensable for the phenotypic and functional maturation of RTEs.",M2
19914379,"Mouse Schwann cells activate <e>MHC</e> class I and II restricted T-cell responses, but require external peptide processing for MHC class II presentation.Schwann cells are the myelinating glia cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In inflammatory neuropathies like the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Schwann cells become target of an autoimmune response, but may also modulate local inflammation. Here, we tested the functional relevance of Schwann cell derived MHC expression in an in vitro coculture system. Mouse Schwann cells activated proliferation of ovalbumin specific CD8+ T cells when ovalbumin protein or MHC class I restricted ovalbumin peptide (Ova(257-264) SIINFEKL) was added and after transfection with an ovalbumin coding vector. Schwann cells activated proliferation of ovalbumin specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of MHC class II restricted ovalbumin peptide (Ova(323-339) ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR). CD4+ T-cell proliferation was not activated by ovalbumin protein or transfection with an ovalbumin coding vector. This indicates that Schwann cells express functionally active MHC class I and II molecules. In this study, however, Schwann cells lacked the ability to process exogenous antigen or cross-present endogenous antigen into the MHC class II presentation pathway. Thus, antigen presentation may be a pathological function of Schwann cells exacerbating nerve damage in inflammatory neuropathies.",M2
19907296,"Cauterization of central cornea induces recruitment of major histocompatibility complex class II+ Langerhans cells from limbal basal epithelium.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution and characterization of Langerhans cells (LCs) in the rat corneal epithelium and to compare the findings with those obtained earlier in the mouse corneal epithelium. METHODS: Normal and cauterized corneal tissues were excised from Wistar rats, and immunofluorescence staining for major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class II, CD3, CD11c, CD11b, CD45, CD80(B-1), and CD86(B-2) was performed by confocal microscopy. The density of intraepithelial MHC class II+ LCs was quantified. RESULTS: In the normal corneal epithelium, CD11c+ cells were exclusively distributed in the limbal and peripheral areas. Double staining showed that these cells were CD45 and MHC class II positive and B7 (CD80 or CD86) costimulatory molecules, CD11b, and CD3 negative, exhibiting a dendritic cell phenotype. In cauterized cornea, the expression of MHC class II was significantly enhanced in the limbal basal epithelium. The expression of the activation markers, CD80 and CD86, by MHC class II+ LCs was first present in the limbal basal epithelium as early as 4 hours after corneal inflammation and later throughout the entire corneal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates for the first time the distribution and characterization of LCs in the rat corneal epithelium, which largely resembles most of those observed in the mouse cornea. In the cauterized cornea, B7+ LCs were first present in the limbal basal epithelium, suggesting that these cells play an important role in corneal inflammatory reaction.",M2

The database represents the molecular structures recognized by adaptive immune receptors and the experimental contexts in which these molecules were determined to be immune epitopes. Epitopes recognized in humans, nonhuman primates, rodents, pigs, cats and all other tested species are included. Both positive and negative experimental results are captured. Over the course of 4 years, the data from 180,978 experiments were curated manually from the literature, which covers approximately 99% of all publicly available information on peptide epitopes mapped in infectious agents (excluding HIV) and 93% of those mapped in allergens. In addition, data that would otherwise be unavailable to the public from 129,186 experiments were submitted directly by investigators. The curation of epitopes related to autoimmunity is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. The database can be queried by epitope structure, source organism, MHC restriction, assay type or host organism, among other criteria. The database structure, as well as its querying, browsing and reporting interfaces, was completely redesigned for the IEDB 2.0 release, which became publicly available in early 2009.",M2
19906192,"Does our current understanding of immune tolerance, autoimmunity, and immunosuppressive mechanisms facilitate the design of efficient cancer vaccines?The therapeutic use of the immune system to attack cancer cells has been a longstanding vision among tumour immunologists. However, most human tumours are poorly immunogenic and are able to invade the host immune system. Although these obstacles are clearly critical to cancer vaccine development, the induction of a strong anti-tumour immune response may rely on the activation of high affinity T cells through a molecular mimicry mechanism which involves cross-reactive recognition of foreign antigens mimicking the structure of tumour proteins. Taking into account the disparity in HLA molecules needed to present shared antigens; in late 1990s Stauss et al. described the possibility of generating allorestricted high affinity cytotoxic T cells against synthetic self-peptides bound to non-self-<e>MHC</e> molecules. In addition to the strategies indicated above, the inhibition of the immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumour invasion of the immune system using RNA interference also offers a new approach to vaccine design. This review highlights the problem of immune tolerance, the induction of autoreactive T cells, and describes strategies to enhance tumour immunity.",M2
19903780,"Effect of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor on circulating CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to a multipeptide melanoma vaccine: outcome of a multicenter randomized trial.PURPOSE: Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administered locally together with vaccines can augment T-cell responses in animal models. Human experience has been limited to small and uncontrolled trials. Thus, a multicenter randomized phase II trial was done to determine whether local administration of GM-CSF augments immunogenicity of a multipeptide vaccine. It also assessed immunogenicity of administration in one versus two vaccine sites. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred twenty-one eligible patients with resected stage IIB to IV melanoma were vaccinated with 12 <e>MHC</e> class I-restricted melanoma peptides to stimulate CD8+ T cells plus a HLA-DR-restricted tetanus helper peptide to stimulate CD4+ T cells, emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, with or without 110 microg GM-CSF. Among 119 evaluable patients, T-cell responses were assessed by IFN-gamma ELIspot assay and tetramer analysis. Clinical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: CD8+ T-cell response rates to the 12 MHC class I-restricted melanoma peptides (by day 50) with or without GM-CSF were 34% and 73%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001), by direct ELIspot assay. Tetramer analyses corroborated the functional data. CD4+ T-cell responses to tetanus helper peptide were higher without GM-CSF (95% versus 77%; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference by number of vaccine sites. Three-year overall and disease-free survival estimates (95% confidence interval) were 76% (67-83%) and 52% (43-61%), respectively, with too few events to assess differences by study group. CONCLUSIONS: High immune response rates for this multipeptide vaccine were achieved, but CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses were lower when administered with GM-CSF. These data challenge the value of local GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant in humans.",M2
19901990,"Identification of a dual-specific T cell epitope of the hemagglutinin antigen of an h5 avian influenza virus in chickens.Avian influenza viruses (AIV) of the H5N1 subtype have caused morbidity and mortality in humans. Although some migratory birds constitute the natural reservoir for this virus, chickens may play a role in transmission of the virus to humans. Despite the importance of avian species in transmission of AIV H5N1 to humans, very little is known about host immune system interactions with this virus in these species. The objective of the present study was to identify putative T cell epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen of an H5 AIV in chickens. Using an overlapping peptide library covering the HA protein, we identified a 15-mer peptide, H5(246-260,) within the HA1 domain which induced activation of T cells in chickens immunized against the HA antigen of an H5 virus. Furthermore, H5(246-260) epitope was found to be presented by both major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I and II molecules, leading to activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, marked by proliferation and expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma by both of these cell subsets as well as the expression of granzyme A by CD8+ T cells. This is the first report of a T cell epitope of AIV recognized by chicken T cells. Furthermore, this study extends the previous finding of the existence of dual-specific epitopes in other species to chickens. Taken together, these results elucidate some of the mechanisms of immune response to AIV in chickens and provide a platform for creation of rational vaccines against AIV in this species.",M2
19901985,"Acute inhibition of selected membrane-proximal mouse T cell receptor signaling by mitochondrial antagonists.T cells absorb nanometric membrane vesicles, prepared from plasma membrane of antigen presenting cells, via dual receptor/ligand interactions of T cell receptor (TCR) with cognate peptide/major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) plus lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) with intercellular adhesion molecule 1. TCR-mediated signaling for LFA-1 activation is also required for the vesicle absorption. Exploiting those findings, we had established a high throughput screening (HTS) platform and screened a library for isolation of small molecules inhibiting the vesicle absorption. Follow-up studies confirmed that treatments (1 hour) with various mitochondrial antagonists, including a class of anti-diabetic drugs (i.e., Metformin and Phenformin), resulted in ubiquitous inhibition of the vesicle absorption without compromising viability of T cells. Further studies revealed that the mitochondrial drug treatments caused impairment of specific membrane-proximal TCR signaling event(s). Thus, activation of Akt and PLC-gamma1 and entry of extracellular Ca(2+) following TCR stimulation were attenuated while polymerization of monomeric actins upon TCR triggering progressed normally after the treatments. Dynamic F-actin rearrangement concurring with the vesicle absorption was also found to be impaired by the drug treatments, implying that the inhibition by the drug treatments of downstream signaling events (and the vesicle absorption) could result from lack of directional relocation of signaling and cell surface molecules. We also assessed the potential application of mitochondrial antagonists as immune modulators by probing effects of the long-term drug treatments (24 hours) on viability of resting primary T cells and cell cycle progression of antigen-stimulated T cells. This study unveils a novel regulatory mechanism for T cell immunity in response to environmental factors having effects on mitochondrial function.",M2

19892989,"A single peptide-<e>MHC</e> complex positively selects a diverse and specific CD8 T cell repertoire.Pathogen recognition by T cells is dependent on their exquisite specificity for self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules presenting a bound peptide. Although this specificity results from positive and negative selection of developing T cells in the thymus, the relative contribution of these two processes remains controversial. To address the relation between the selecting peptide-MHC complex and the specificity of mature T cells, we generated transgenic mice that express a single peptide-MHC class I complex. We demonstrate that positive selection of CD8 T cells in these mice results in an MHC-specific repertoire. Although selection on a single complex is peptide promiscuous, mature T cells are highly peptide specific. Thus, positive selection imparts MHC and peptide specificity on the peripheral CD8 T cell repertoire.",M2
19891747,"Opposites attract: <e>MHC</e>-associated mate choice in a polygynous primate.We investigated reproduction in a semi-free-ranging population of a polygynous primate, the mandrill, in relation to genetic relatedness and male genetic characteristics, using neutral microsatellite and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotyping. We compared genetic dissimilarity to the mother and genetic characteristics of the sire with all other potential sires present at the conception of each offspring (193 offspring for microsatellite genetics, 180 for MHC). The probability that a given male sired increased as pedigree relatedness with the mother decreased, and overall genetic dissimilarity and MHC dissimilarity with the mother increased. Reproductive success also increased with male microsatellite heterozygosity and MHC diversity. These effects were apparent despite the strong influence of dominance rank on male reproductive success. The closed nature of our study population is comparable to human populations for which MHC-associated mate choice has been reported, suggesting that such mate choice may be especially important in relatively isolated populations with little migration to introduce genetic variation.",M2

METHODS: Endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured and stimulated by a variety of factors: A, normal control group; B, inactivated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection group; C, HCMV infection group; D, HCMV supernatant infection group; and E, ganciclovir HCMV group. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and major histocompability complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I and class II antigens was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We found characteristic CMV-infected ECs in this study. There were no significant differences among groups A, B and D (P&gt;0.05). Although the expression levels of ICAM-1 were not significantly different between groups C and E (P&gt;0.05), the ICAM-1 expression in these two groups was significantly higher than that in group A (P&lt;0.05). ICAM-1 expression was detected in groups C and E, while there was no expression in groups A, B and D. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of ICAM-1 mRNA expression between groups C and E (P&gt;0.05). Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC expression was detected in all the groups, while HLA-DR expression was only detected in groups C and E. There were no significant differences of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR expression among groups A, B and D (P&gt;0.05). However, the HLA-ABC and HLA-DR expression levels in groups C and D were higher than those of the remaining groups previously reported (P&lt;0.05).

19864609,"Defining the turkey <e>MHC</e>: sequence and genes of the B locus.The MHC, the most polymorphic and gene dense region in the vertebrate genome, contains many loci essential to immunity. In mammals, this region spans approximately 4 Mb. Studies of avian species have found the MHC to be greatly reduced in size and gene content with an overall locus organization differing from that of mammals. The chicken MHC has been mapped to two distinct regions (MHC-B and -Y) of a single chromosome. MHC-B haplotypes possess tightly linked genes encoding the classical MHC molecules and few other disease resistance genes. Furthermore, chicken haplotypes possess a dominantly expressed class I and class II B locus that have a significant effect on the progression or regression of pathogenic disease. In this study, we present the MHC-B region of the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) as a similarly constricted locus, with 34 genes identified within a 0.2-Mb region in near-perfect synteny with that of the chicken MHC-B. Notable differences between the two species are three BG and class II B loci in the turkey compared with one BG and two class II B loci in the chicken MHC-B. The relative size and high level of similarity of the turkey MHC in relation to that of the chicken suggest that similar associations with disease susceptibility and resistance may also be found in turkey.",M2
19864282,"Sexual conflict inhibits female mate choice for major histocompatibility complex dissimilarity in Chinook salmon.In many species females prefer major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) dissimilar mates, which may improve offspring resistance to pathogens. However, sexual conflict may interfere with female preference when males attempt to mate with all females, regardless of compatibility. Here we used semi-natural spawning channels to examine how mating behaviour and genetic similarity at the MHC class II peptide binding region affected parentage patterns in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We found that females directed aggression at more MHC-similar males than expected by chance, providing a possible mechanism of female MHC choice in salmon. Males also directed aggression towards MHC-similar females, which was consistent with males harassing unreceptive mates. Males' aggression was positively correlated with their reproductive success, and it appeared to overcome female aversion to mating with MHC-similar males, as females who were the target of high levels of male aggression had lower than expected MHC divergence in their offspring. Indeed, offspring MHC divergence was highest when the sex ratio was female-biased and male harassment was likely to be less intense. These data suggest that male harassment can reduce female effectiveness in selecting MHC-compatible mates, and sexual conflict can thus have an indirect cost to females.",M2
19862823,"Distinct <e>MHC</e> gene expression patterns during progression of melanoma.Abnormal expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in melanoma has been reported previously. However, the MHC molecule expression patterns in different growth phases of melanoma and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that in vertical growth phase (VGP) melanomas, MHC genes are subject to increased rates of DNA copy number gains, accompanied by increased expression, in comparison to normal melanocytes. In contrast, MHC expression in metastatic melanomas drastically decreased compared to VGP melanomas, despite still prevalent DNA copy number gains. Subsequent investigations found that the master transactivator of MHC genes, CIITA, was also significantly downregulated in metastatic melanomas when compared to VGP melanomas. This could be one of the mechanisms accounting for the discrepancy between DNA copy number and expression level in metastatic melanomas, a potentially separate mechanism of gene regulation. These results infer a dynamic role of MHC function in melanoma progression. We propose potential mechanisms for the overexpression of MHC molecules in earlier stages of melanoma as well as for its downregulation in metastatic melanomas.",M2

19860675,"Use of <e>MHC</e> II structural features in the design of vaccines for organ-specific autoimmune diseases.The Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II locus is the primary genetic linkage to autoimmune diseases. Susceptibility to each such disease is linked to different alleles, with a few alleles showing also dominant protection. The design of vaccines for autoimmune diseases is a long sought-after goal. As knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases has increased, the tools for such an approach have of necessity been refined. We review below the structural essence of MHC II-linked autoimmune diseases which centers on the binding of antigenic peptides to the disease-linked MHC II proteins, and the consequent activation of cognate TCRs from pathogenic CD4+ T cells. The state of affairs in two organ-specific autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease are covered, including attempts to treat these via antigen-specific MHC II-guided measures.

Exposed at the cell surface to scrutiny by T cells, MHC:peptide complexes mediate a highly specific and immediate information transfer from diseased cells to the cellular immune system. Numerous clinical vaccination trials have been carried out employing MHC-presented peptides for T-cell activation with encouraging results but so far without a final breakthrough. In this review, we briefly highlight the molecular basis of MHC-peptide interactions governed by specificity pockets and anchor residues, as summarized in allele-specific peptide motifs. State-of-the-art technology is comprehensively presented and gives an overview of modern mass spectrometric strategies used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of MHC ligands. We describe the details of the HLA-B*3801 peptide motif by comparing features of natural MHC ligands, resulting in a scoring matrix that enables epitope prediction from any viral or tumor antigen. The pronounced individuality in peptide presentation by MHC molecules, as reflected in the highly specific peptide motifs of different MHC allotypes or the tissue-specific MHC ligandomes, represents a current area of interest within this field. Finally, the identification of post-translational modifications--most important phosphorylations--and the promises this holds will be discussed in this chapter.",M2
19860671,"Prediction of <e>MHC</e>-peptide binding: a systematic and comprehensive overview.T cell immune responses are driven by the recognition of peptide antigens (T cell epitopes) that are bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. T cell epitope immunogenicity is thus contingent on several events, including appropriate and effective processing of the peptide from its protein source, stable peptide binding to the MHC molecule, and recognition of the MHC-bound peptide by the T cell receptor. Of these three hallmarks, MHC-peptide binding is the most selective event that determines T cell epitopes. Therefore, prediction of MHC-peptide binding constitutes the principal basis for anticipating potential T cell epitopes. The tremendous relevance of epitope identification in vaccine design and in the monitoring of T cell responses has spurred the development of many computational methods for predicting MHC-peptide binding that improve the efficiency and economics of T cell epitope identification. In this report, we will systematically examine the available methods for predicting MHC-peptide binding and discuss their most relevant advantages and drawbacks.",M2

19851445,"High-density SNP screening of the major histocompatibility complex in systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrates strong evidence for independent susceptibility regions.A substantial genetic contribution to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk is conferred by major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) gene(s) on chromosome 6p21. Previous studies in SLE have lacked statistical power and genetic resolution to fully define MHC influences. We characterized 1,610 Caucasian SLE cases and 1,470 parents for 1,974 MHC SNPs, the highly polymorphic HLA-DRB1 locus, and a panel of ancestry informative markers. Single-marker analyses revealed strong signals for SNPs within several MHC regions, as well as with HLA-DRB1 (global p = 9.99 x 10(-16)). The most strongly associated DRB1 alleles were: *0301 (odds ratio, OR = 2.21, p = 2.53 x 10(-12)), *1401 (OR = 0.50, p = 0.0002), and *1501 (OR = 1.39, p = 0.0032). The MHC region SNP demonstrating the strongest evidence of association with SLE was rs3117103, with OR = 2.44 and p = 2.80 x 10(-13). Conditional haplotype and stepwise logistic regression analyses identified strong evidence for association between SLE and the extended class I, class I, class III, class II, and the extended class II MHC regions. Sequential removal of SLE-associated DRB1 haplotypes revealed independent effects due to variation within OR2H2 (extended class I, rs362521, p = 0.006), CREBL1 (class III, rs8283, p = 0.01), and DQB2 (class II, rs7769979, p = 0.003, and rs10947345, p = 0.0004). Further, conditional haplotype analyses demonstrated that variation within MICB (class I, rs3828903, p = 0.006) also contributes to SLE risk independent of HLA-DRB1*0301. Our results for the first time delineate with high resolution several MHC regions with independent contributions to SLE risk.

Furthermore, most studies to date have been limited to the examination of a subset of the HLA and non-HLA genes with a marker density and sample size insufficient for mapping all independent association signals. We genotyped a panel of 1,472 SNPs to capture the common genomic variation across the 3.44 megabase (Mb) classic MHC region in 10,576 DNA samples derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, selective IgA deficiency, multiple sclerosis, and appropriate control samples.

19846459,"Costly major histocompatibility complex signals produced only by reproductively active males, but not females, must be validated by a 'maleness signal' in three-spined sticklebacks.Olfactory information about individual major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) immune genotypes is important for mate choice in several species. For example, during the mate choice decisions of three-spined sticklebacks, females assess males on the basis of odour cues that convey information about their MHC diversity. Here, we show that an additional 'maleness' signal is needed to validate the MHC signal. Furthermore, using interaction between natural odour of sticklebacks and synthetic MHC-ligand peptides, we show that MHC signals are conditional on the reproductive state in males. By contrast, we find that gravid females do not produce such signals. Since MHC olfactory signals relevant to mate choice decisions are conditional upon gender and reproductive state, we suggest that their manufacture is likely to be costly to senders, and therefore, potentially conditional on the health/parasitization status of the sender. We hypothesize that shedding of peptide-MHC complexes compromises immune function, selecting against unconditional use of these signals.",M2
19830457,"Adult survival and microsatellite diversity in possums: effects of major histocompatibility complex-linked microsatellite diversity but not multilocus inbreeding estimators.Adult survival is perhaps the fitness parameter most important to population growth in long-lived species. Intrinsic and extrinsic covariates of survival are therefore likely to be important drivers of population dynamics. We used long-term mark-recapture data to identify genetic, individual and environmental covariates of local survival in a natural population of mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami). Rainfall and intra-individual diversity at microsatellite DNA markers were associated with increased local survival of adults and juveniles. We contrasted the performance of several microsatellite heterozygosity measures, including internal relatedness (IR), homozygosity by loci (HL) and the mean multilocus estimate of the squared difference in microsatellite allele sizes within an individual (mean d (2)). However, the strongest effect on survival was not associated with multilocus microsatellite diversity (which would indicate a genome-wide inbreeding effect), but a subset of two loci. This included a major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>)-linked marker and a putatively neutral microsatellite locus. For both loci, diversity measures incorporating allele size information had stronger associations with survival than measures based on heterozygosity, whether or not allele frequency information was included (such as IR). Increased survival was apparent among heterozygotes at the MHC-linked locus, but the benefits of heterozygosity to survival were reduced in heterozygotes with larger differences in allele size. The effect of heterozygosity on fitness-related traits was supported by data on endoparasites in a subset of the individuals studied in this population. There was no apparent density dependence in survival, nor an effect of sex, age or immigrant status. Our findings suggest that in the apparent absence of inbreeding, variation at specific loci can generate strong associations between fitness and diversity at linked markers.",M2
19821902,"Major histocompatibility complex heterozygote advantage and widespread bacterial infections in populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).Despite growing evidence for parasite-mediated selection on the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>), little is known about variation in the bacterial parasite community within and among host populations or its influence on MHC evolution. In this study, we characterize variation in the parasitic bacterial community associated with Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry in five populations in British Columbia (BC), Canada across 2 years, and examine whether bacterial infections are a potential source of selection on the MHC. We found an unprecedented diversity of bacteria infecting fry with a total of 55 unique bacteria identified. Bacterial infection rates varied from 9% to 29% among populations and there was a significant isolation by distance relationship in bacterial community phylogenetic similarity across the populations. Spatial variation in the frequency of infections and in the phylogenetic similarity of bacterial communities may result in differential parasite-mediated selection at the MHC across populations. Across all populations, we found evidence of a heterozygote advantage at the MHC class II, which may be a source of balancing selection on this locus. Interestingly, a co-inertia analysis indicated only susceptibility associations between a few of the MHC class I and II alleles and specific bacterial parasites; there was no evidence that any of the alleles provided resistance to the bacteria. Our results reveal a complex bacterial community infecting populations of a fish and underscore the importance of considering the role of multiple pathogens in the evolution of host adaptations.",M2
19813199,"Syrian hamster infected with Leishmania infantum: a new experimental model for inflammatory myopathies.Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are inflammatory disorders of unknown origin. On the basis of clinical, histopathological, and immunological features, they can be differentiated into three major and distinct subsets: dermatomyositis; polymyositis; and inclusion-body myositis. Although a few animal models for IIM are currently available, they lack several characteristic aspects of IIMs. The aim of our study was to examine skeletal muscle involvement in an experimental animal model of visceral leishmaniasis, a disseminated infection caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, and to compare features of associated inflammation with those of human IIM. Syrian hamsters infected intraperitoneally with amastigotes of L. infantum were killed at 3 or 4 months post-infection, and the skeletal muscles were studied. Focal inflammation was predominantly observed in the endomysium and, to a lesser extent, in perivascular areas. Degenerating muscle fibers were also found, as well as myonecrosis. Immunofluorescence with confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to characterize the phenotype of inflammatory infiltrates and the distribution of <e>MHC</e> class I and II in muscle biopsies. The infiltrating inflammatory cells consisted mainly of T cells, and CD8(+) T cells were found in non-necrotic muscle fibers that expressed MHC class I on the sarcolemma. In addition to T cells, several macrophages were present. The model we are proposing closely resembles polymyositis and may be useful in studying certain aspects of this disease such as the role of T cells in muscle inflammation and myocytotoxicity, while also providing novel therapeutic targets.",M2
19811089,"<e>MHC</e> expression on spleen lymphocyte subsets in genetically resistant and susceptible chickens infected with Marek's disease virus.Resistance and susceptibility to Marek's disease (MD) are strongly influenced by the chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In this study, splenic lymphocytes from MD-resistant and MD-susceptible chickens of three MHC genotypes (B21/B21, B19/B21, and B19/B19) were analyzed by flow cytometry for MHC surface expression. In the spleen, constitutive MHC class I surface expression was found to be highest in homozygous B19, lowest in homozygous B21, and intermediate in heterozygous B19/B21 animals. This was observed on CD4(+), CD8(+), and Bu-1(+) splenic lymphocytes. Chickens of all three genotypes were subjected to infection with MD virus (GA strain) and spleen samples from infected as well as MHC-matched negative controls were analyzed at 1, 4, and 8 wk post-infection (p.i.). It was observed that MDV induced an increase in MHC class I expression late in the infection. Thus, MHC class I was increased on the surface of CD4(+) cells from infected chickens of all genotypes at 4 and 8 wk p.i. compared with negative controls. Also, MHC class I expression was increased on CD8(+) cells from infected chickens of all genotypes at 4 and 8 wk p.i., except for the homozygous B19 animals, that showed no increase at 8 wk p.i. MDV-induced differences in MHC class II surface levels were also found. Thus, MHC class II expression was increased on CD4(+) cells from infected B19/21 and B21/B21 chickens at 4 wk p.i., and also at 8 wk p.i. on CD4(+) cells from infected B19/B21 animals. MHC class II expression was increased on CD8(+) cells from infected chickens of all genotypes at 4 wk p.i. These findings suggest that MDV infection in vivo increases the level of MHC surface expression on splenic T cells, indicating a possible role in immunity against MDV.",M2
19808674,"Mechanism for amyloid precursor-like protein 2 enhancement of major histocompatibility complex class I molecule degradation.Earlier studies have demonstrated interaction of the murine major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I molecule K(d) with amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), a ubiquitously expressed member of the amyloid precursor protein family. Our current findings indicate that APLP2 is internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner, as shown by utilization of inhibitors of the clathrin pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that APLP2 and K(d) bind at the cell surface and are internalized together. The APLP2 cytoplasmic tail contains two overlapping consensus motifs for binding to the adaptor protein-2 complex, and mutation of a tyrosine shared by both motifs severely impaired APLP2 internalization and ability to promote K(d) endocytosis. Upon increased expression of wild type APLP2, K(d) molecules were predominantly directed to the lysosomes rather than recycled to the plasma membrane. These findings suggest a model in which APLP2 binds K(d) at the plasma membrane, facilitates uptake of K(d) in a clathrin-dependent manner, and routes the endocytosed K(d) to the lysosomal degradation pathway. Thus, APLP2 has a multistep trafficking function that influences the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules at the plasma membrane.",M2
19805366,"BG1 has a major role in <e>MHC</e>-linked resistance to malignant lymphoma in the chicken.Pathogen selection is postulated to drive MHC allelic diversity at loci for antigen presentation. However, readily apparent MHC infectious disease associations are rare in most species. The strong link between MHC-B haplotype and the occurrence of virally induced tumors in the chicken provides a means for defining the relationship between pathogen selection and MHC polymorphism. Here, we verified a significant difference in resistance to gallid herpesvirus-2 (GaHV-2)-induced lymphomas (Marek's disease) conferred by two closely-related recombinant MHC-B haplotypes. We mapped the crossover breakpoints that distinguish these haplotypes to the highly polymorphic BG1 locus. BG1 encodes an Ig-superfamily type I transmembrane receptor-like protein that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), which undergoes phosphorylation and is recognized by Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2). The recombinant haplotypes are identical, except for differences within the BG1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The 3'-UTR of the BG1 allele associated with increased lymphoma contains a 225-bp insert of retroviral origin and showed greater inhibition of luciferase reporter gene translation compared to the other allele. These findings suggest that BG1 could affect the outcome of GaHV-2 infection through modulation of the lymphoid cell responsiveness to infection, a condition that is critical for GaHV-2 replication and in which the MHC-B haplotype has been previously implicated. This work provides a mechanism by which MHC-B region genetics contributes to the incidence of GaHV-2-induced malignant lymphoma in the chicken and invites consideration of the possibility that similar mechanisms might affect the incidence of lymphomas associated with other oncogenic viral infections.",M2

19775471,"Analysis of TACI mutations in CVID &amp; RESPI patients who have inherited HLA B*44 or HLA*B8.BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested that Common Variable Immunodeficieny (CVID) can present as an autosomal dominant trait dependent on the inheritance of a set of uncommon mutations/alleles of TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor) involving exons 3 or 4. Penetrance, however, appears to be incomplete. Among our clinic population, the greatest genetic linkage for CVID is to the major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) on chromosome 6. The majority of our patients have inherited HLA *DQ2, *DR7, *DR3(17), *B8, and/or *B44. Of these, HLA*B44 was present in almost half of the patients and was thus the most common susceptibility allele. HLA *B44 was also found to be over-represented among patients who presented to our clinic with adult-onset recurrent sinopulmonary infections (RESPI) and normal serum immunoglobulin levels, a cohort that included first and second degree relatives of patients with CVID. One of the two original reports of the association between TACI and CVID also reported Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes. Of 13 affected subjects, nine had inherited HLA *B8 and six had inherited HLA B44. This raised the possibility that TACI mutations might synergize with MHC class I alleles to enhance susceptibility to humoral immune deficiency. METHODS: We identified 63 CVID patients irrespective of HLA status and 13 RESPI patients who had inherited HLA*B44. To evaluate for mutations in the gene for TACI, we PCR amplified and sequenced TACI exons 3 and 4 from these patients. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, eleven proved heterozygous for a previously reported, silent T-&gt;G polymorphism [rs35062843] at proline 97 in exon 3. However, none of the 13 RESPI patients and only one of the 63 CVID patients inherited a TACI allele previously associated with CVID. This patient was heterozygous for the TACI A181E allele (exon 4). She did not carry *DQ2, *DR7, *DR3(17), *B8, or *B44. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that TACI mutations are unlikely to play a critical role in creating susceptibility to CVID among patients with previously recognized MHC class I and class II susceptibility alleles.

19772830,"Rheumatoid arthritis genetics: 2009 update.Recent human genetic discoveries have increased our understanding of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies have expanded the number of validated RA risk loci beyond HLA-DRB1  shared epitope  alleles to include additional major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) risk alleles and more than 10 regions outside the MHC. The newly discovered risk alleles are common in the general population, have a modest effect on RA risk, and together explain less than 5% of the variance in disease risk. Whereas the actual causal mutation and causal gene for most loci remain to be determined, these studies are beginning to reveal general themes: many risk loci are associated with other autoimmune diseases; many genes fall within discrete biological pathways (eg, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells signaling pathway); and human genetics can group diseases into clinically meaningful subset categories (eg, presence or absence of autoantibodies). This review discusses recent RA genetic discoveries in terms of their potential to improve patient care.",M2
19772349,"A general and efficient approach for NMR studies of peptide dynamics in class I <e>MHC</e> peptide binding grooves.T-Cell receptor recognition of peptides bound by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins initiates a cellular immune response. Dynamics of peptides within MHC binding grooves can influence TCR recognition, yet NMR studies which could address this rigorously have been hindered by the expense of isotopically labeled peptides and the large size of peptide-MHC complexes. Here we describe a methodology for characterizing peptide dynamics within MHC binding grooves via NMR, using a biosynthetic approach for producing labeled peptide. With the Tax(11-19) peptide bound to the human class I MHC HLA-A*0201, we demonstrate that peptide generated in this manner can be well characterized in MHC binding grooves by NMR, providing opportunities to more precisely study the role of peptide dynamics in TCR recognition. Demonstrating the utility of such studies, the data with the Tax(11-19) peptide indicate the presence of slow conformational exchange in the peptide, supporting an  induced-fit  style TCR binding mechanism.",M2
19755422,"Different strategies adopted by K(b) and L(d) to generate T cell specificity directed against their respective bound peptides.Mouse T cell clone 2C recognizes two different major histocompatibility (<e>MHC</e>) ligands, the self MHC K(b) and the allogeneic MHC L(d). Two distinct peptides, SIY (SIYRYYGL) and QL9 (QLSPFPFDL), act as strong and specific agonists when bound to K(b) and L(d), respectively. To explore further the mechanisms involved in peptide potency and specificity, here we examined a collection of single amino acid peptide variants of SIY and QL9 for 1) T cell activity, 2) binding to their respective MHC, and 3) binding to the 2C T cell receptor (TCR) and high affinity TCR mutants. Characterization of SIY binding to MHC K(b) revealed significant effects of three SIY residues that were clearly embedded within the K(b) molecule. In contrast, QL9 binding to MHC L(d) was influenced by the majority of peptide side chains, distributed across the entire length of the peptide. Binding of the SIY-K(b) complex to the TCR involved three SIY residues that were pointed toward the TCR, whereas again the majority of QL9 residues influenced binding of TCRs, and thus the QL9 residues had impacts on both L(d) and TCR binding. In general, the magnitude of T cell activity mediated by a peptide variant was influenced more by peptide binding to MHC than by binding the TCR, especially for higher affinity TCRs. Findings with both systems, but QL9-L(d) in particular, suggest that many single-residue substitutions, introduced into peptides to improve their binding to MHC and thus their vaccine potential, could impair T cell reactivity due to their dual impact on TCR binding.",M2
19741092,"Physical and functional interaction of transmembrane thioredoxin-related protein with major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain: redox-based protein quality control and its potential relevance to immune responses.In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a variety of oxidoreductases classified in the thioredoxin superfamily have been found to catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds. However, the precise function and specificity of the individual thioredoxin family proteins remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterize a transmembrane thioredoxin-related protein (TMX), a membrane-bound oxidoreductase in the ER. TMX exists in a predominantly reduced form and associates with the molecular chaperon calnexin, which can mediate substrate binding. To determine the target molecules for TMX, we apply a substrate-trapping approach based on the reaction mechanism of thiol-disulfide exchange, identifying major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I heavy chain (HC) as a candidate substrate. Unlike the classical ER oxidoreductases such as protein disulfide isomerase and ERp57, TMX seems not to be essential for normal assembly of MHC class I molecules. However, we show that TMX-class I HC interaction is enhanced during tunicamycin-induced ER stress, and TMX prevents the ER-to-cytosol retrotranslocation of misfolded class I HC targeted for proteasomal degradation. These results suggest a specific role for TMX and its mechanism of action in redox-based ER quality control.",M2
19728113,"Parasite mediated homogenizing selection at the <e>MHC</e> in guppies.Understanding the selective forces influencing genetic diversity is a fundamental goal of evolutionary ecology. The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the adaptive immune response of vertebrates and thus provide an excellent opportunity to examine the agents of selection on a functionally important gene. Here we examine the genetic architecture of the MHC class IIB genes in 10 wild populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in Northern Trinidad. We have previously shown that these populations are significantly less diverged at the class IIB locus than expected based on neutral (microsatellite) loci. We now survey infection by Gyrodactylus turnbulli and G. bullatarudis, common parasitic worms that infect guppies, as a potential agent of homogenizing selection. We used a genetic algorithm to partition both additive and non-additive genetic effects of the five most common MHC allele types as well as a rare allele category. Although we found no evidence for non-additive effects, across the populations we found that one allele type (the a-type) had a significant negative additive effect on parasite load. Thus, individuals who had more copies of the a-type allele were infected with fewer gyrodactylus than individuals with fewer copies of the allele. These results not only link parasite infection with MHC genotype, they provide a mechanism of homogenizing selection across these otherwise disparate populations.",M2
19724264,"Induction of tumor-specific immune response by gene transfer of Hsp70-cell-penetrating peptide fusion protein to tumors in mice.To induce a tumor-specific immune response by delivering tumor-associated antigens in tumor cells to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), we designed a fusion protein which consists of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the C-terminal 34 amino acids of herpes simplex virus VP22 protein (VP22(268-301)), the former having a peptide binding domain and an ability to be recognized by APCs, and the latter able to achieve cell penetration. Hsp70-VP22(268-301), the fusion protein, was efficiently taken up by mouse dendritic cell (DC) line DC2.4. Major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) class I-restricted presentation of an epitope peptide of ovalbumin (OVA) was examined in DC2.4, and Hsp70-VP22(268-301) significantly increased the presentation of the peptide compared with Hsp70. Electroporation-assisted injection of naked plasmid vector expressing Hsp70-VP22(268-301) (pHsp70-VP22(268-301)) into subcutaneous tumors of EG7-OVA, a mouse lymphoma-expressing OVA, significantly increased the survival of mice compared with the same treatment with pHSp70, a plasmid expressing Hsp70. Splenocytes from the pHsp70-VP22(268-301)-treated mice exhibited cytolytic activity against both EG7-OVA and the parent EL4, but not against mouse melanoma B16-F10, suggesting that not only OVA-derived antigens but those common to EG7-OVA and EL4 are delivered to APCs. These results provide a new therapeutic method to induce tumor-specific antitumor immunity without identifying nor isolating tumor-associated antigens.",M2
19720873,"The TRC8 E3 ligase ubiquitinates <e>MHC</e> class I molecules before dislocation from the ER.The US2 and US11 gene products of human cytomegalovirus promote viral evasion by hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. US2 and US11 initiate dislocation of newly translocated major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby decreasing cell surface MHC I. Despite being instrumental in elucidating the mammalian ERAD pathway, the responsible E3 ligase or ligases remain unknown. Using a functional small interfering RNA library screen, we now identify TRC8 (translocation in renal carcinoma, chromosome 8 gene), an ER-resident E3 ligase previously implicated as a hereditary kidney cancer gene, as required for US2-mediated MHC I ubiquitination. Depletion of TRC8 prevents MHC I ubiquitination and dislocation by US2 and restores cell surface MHC I. TRC8 forms an integral part of a novel multiprotein ER complex that contains MHC I, US2, and signal peptide peptidase. Our data show that the TRC8 E3 ligase is required for MHC I dislocation from the ER and identify a new complex associated with mammalian ERAD.",M2
19720792,"Virus-induced autoimmune diabetes in the LEW.1WR1 rat requires Iddm14 and a genetic locus proximal to the major histocompatibility complex.OBJECTIVE: To identify genes that confer susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes following viral infection in the LEW.1WR1 rat. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: About 2% of LEW.1WR1 rats develop spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. Immunological perturbants including viral infection increase both the frequency and tempo of diabetes onset. To identify diabetes susceptibility genes (LEW.1WR1 x WF), F2 rats were infected with Kilham rat virus following brief pretreatment with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. This treatment induces diabetes in 100% of parental LEW.1WR1 rats and 0% of parental WF rats. Linkage to diabetes was analyzed by genome-wide scanning. RESULTS: Among 182 F2 rats, 57 (31%) developed autoimmune diabetes after a mean latency of 16 days. All diabetic animals and approximately 20% of nondiabetic animals exhibited pancreatic insulitis. Genome-wide scanning revealed a requirement for the Iddm14 locus, long known to be required for diabetes in the BB rat. In addition, a new locus near the RT1 major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) was found to be a major determinant of disease susceptibility. Interestingly, one gene linked to autoimmune diabetes in mouse and human, UBD, lies within this region. CONCLUSIONS: The Iddm14 diabetes locus in the rat is a powerful determinant of disease penetrance in the LEW.1WR1 rat following viral infection. In addition, a locus near the MHC (Iddm37) conditions diabetes susceptibility in these animals. Other, as-yet-unidentified genes are required to convert latent susceptibility to overt diabetes. These data provide insight into the polygenic nature of autoimmune diabetes in the rat and the interplay of genetic and environmental factors underlying disease expression.",M2
19719404,"Genetic diversity of the <e>MHC</e> class-II DQA gene in brown bears (Ursus arctos) on Hokkaido, Northern Japan.To investigate genetic diversity of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene in the brown bear (Ursus arctos) population on Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, we cloned and sequenced parts of exon 2 and intron 2 of the MHC class-II DQA gene from 32 brown bears. According to strict criteria for allele identification established by mammalian MHC nomenclature committees, four DQA types (Urar-DQA*01 to Urar-DQA*04) were identified. Of the four, however, Urar-DQA*04 had a 12-bp deletion not detected in a cDNA analysis, indicating that this is a pseudogene at a distinct locus generated by gene duplication. The nucleotide sequences of the other three DQA alleles, which were expressed (because detected from cDNA), were very similar, indicating lower DQA variation In the Hokkaido brown bear population than in other mammals. We attribute this low genetic diversity to (1) some limited effect of possible balancing selection; (2) bottlenecks and inbreeding after migration and isolation of the Hokkaido brown bear population from the Eurasian Continent; (3) a much slower evolutionary rate in DQA than in other MHC genes in the Hokkaido brown bear population.",M2
19693967,"[Enlightenment from genome-wide association study to genetics of psoriasis]Psoriasis is a common autoimmune and hyper proliferative skin disease, characterized by thick, silvery scale patches. Numerous family studies have provided compelling evidence of a genetic predisposition to psoriasis, although the inheritance pattern is unclear. However, few of these studies have achieved consistent results, except for the <e>MHC</e> locus, a problem frequently encountered in the investigation of complex disease. Using high-throughput techniques to genotype hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms explore their relationship with phenotypes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now proven to be a powerful approach for screening the susceptibility genes (loci) of complex disease. Recently, three GWAS on psoriasis published in Nature Genetics have provided us with many novel clues concerning disease pathogenesis, in both immune and non-immune pathways. The MHC locus (HLA-Cw6 and other MHC variance), the major locus involved in the immune reactions of human immune disease, has consistently been shown to be associated with psoriasis, both in previous linkage and present GWAS. IL-12B and IL23R, which are the two non-MHC genes with highly associated evidence with psoriasis in multiple studies performed so far and potent cytokines with complex biological activities, should be of great importance in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Recent clinical trials, in which anti-IL-12p40 antibodies were used for the treatment of psoriasis, have provided further evidence of the role of IL-12/23 in the pathophysiology of psoriasis,and highlighted a new road of treatment for psoriasis. In 2008,we performed the first large GWAS in the Chinese population and identified a novel susceptibility locus within the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster: LCE3A and LCE3D on chromosome 1q21, with conclusive evidence (rs4085613, p(combined)=6.69*10(-30); odds ratio=0.76). Meanwhile, another group also identified a deletion comprising and LCE gene cluster of LCE3B and LCE3C, which is significantly associated with a risk of psoriasis in Spain, Netherland, Italy and USA. Both of these independent studies provided substantial association evidence for the LCE genes involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The LCE genes encode the stratum-corneum proteins of the cornified envelope, which plays an important role in epidermal terminal differentiation. As we know, psoriasis is a disease of interfollicular epidermis and rapid keratinocyte proliferation may cause the production of parakeratotic keratinocytes in psoriatic skin and, thus, the formation of poorly adherent stratum corneum, which in turn results in the characteristic scale or flakes of psoriasis lesions. Although some of the highlighted genes are already targeted by effective psoriasis therapies, others could become future targets for treatments,especially for the LCE genes, which will be very useful for unlocking new drug targets and tailored treatments for this painful, disfiguring skin disease. Meanwhile larger samples and improved strategy for identification of other susceptibility variants to psoriasis and downstream functional study to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of diseases are also needed. Taken together, unremitting efforts of the basic research on psoriasis will lead us to achieve a better treatment and diagnosis for psoriasis in the near future.",M2
19693422,"Sequence polymorphism and evolution of three cetacean <e>MHC</e> genes.Sequence variability at three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes (DQB, DRA, and MHC-I) of cetaceans was investigated in order to get an overall understanding of cetacean MHC evolution. Little sequence variation was detected at the DRA locus, while extensive and considerable variability were found at the MHC-I and DQB loci. Phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence comparison revealed extensive sharing of identical MHC alleles among different species at the three MHC loci examined. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees for these MHC loci with the trees reconstructed only based on non-PBR sites revealed that allelic similarity/identity possibly reflected common ancestry and were not due to adaptive convergence. At the same time, trans-species evolution was also evidenced that the allelic diversity of the three MHC loci clearly pre-dated species divergence events according to the relaxed molecular clock. It may be the forces of balancing selection acting to maintain the high sequence variability and identical alleles in trans-specific manner at the MHC-I and DQB loci.",M2
19682244,"Complexity and context of <e>MHC</e>-correlated mating preferences in wild populations.There is now substantial and growing evidence for a role of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in shaping individual mate preferences. In view of both its codominant expression and its function in immune response, it is often expected that females aim to avoid inbreeding or maximize offspring MHC-heterozygosity by selecting as mates those males which share fewest or no MHC alleles with themselves. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that this view is over-simplistic: not only is MHC dissimilarity just one of several (perhaps many) criteria important in mate choice decision-making, extremely MHC-dissimilar males may be avoided, and furthermore, specific alleles or combinations might be preferred if they bestow particular advantages. These points are raised in two papers in this Molecular Ecology issue, in which patterns of reproductive success in tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are each inconsistent with a generalized preference for MHC dissimilarity. Together, these studies demonstrate several adaptive reasons for decision rules that do not necessarily result in maximizing mate dissimilarity.",M2
19640970,"Docosahexaenoic acid modifies the clustering and size of lipid rafts and the lateral organization and surface expression of <e>MHC</e> class I of EL4 cells.An emerging molecular mechanism by which docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) exerts its effects is modification of lipid raft organization. The biophysical model, based on studies with liposomes, shows that DHA avoids lipid rafts because of steric incompatibility between DHA and cholesterol. The model predicts that DHA does not directly modify rafts; rather, it incorporates into nonrafts to modify the lateral organization and/or conformation of membrane proteins, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Here, we tested predictions of the model at a cellular level by incorporating oleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and DHA, compared with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) control, into the membranes of EL4 cells. Quantitative microscopy showed that DHA, but not EPA, treatment, relative to the BSA control diminished lipid raft clustering and increased their size. Approximately 30% of DHA was incorporated directly into rafts without changing the distribution of cholesterol between rafts and nonrafts. Quantification of fluorescence colocalization images showed that DHA selectively altered MHC class I lateral organization by increasing the fraction of the nonraft protein into rafts compared with BSA. Both DHA and EPA treatments increased antibody binding to MHC class I compared with BSA. Antibody titration showed that DHA and EPA did not change MHC I conformation but increased total surface levels relative to BSA. Taken together, our findings are not in agreement with the biophysical model. Therefore, we propose a model that reconciles contradictory viewpoints from biophysical and cellular studies to explain how DHA modifies lipid rafts on several length scales. Our study supports the notion that rafts are an important target of DHA's mode of action.",M2
19633717,"Does genetic diversity predict health in humans?Genetic diversity, especially at genes important for immune functioning within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (<e>MHC</e>), has been associated with fitness-related traits, including disease resistance, in many species. Recently, genetic diversity has been associated with mate preferences in humans. Here we asked whether these preferences are adaptive in terms of obtaining healthier mates. We investigated whether genetic diversity (heterozygosity and standardized mean d(2)) at MHC and nonMHC microsatellite loci, predicted health in 153 individuals. Individuals with greater allelic diversity (d(2)) at nonMHC loci and at one MHC locus, linked to HLA-DRB1, reported fewer symptoms over a four-month period than individuals with lower d(2). In contrast, there were no associations between MHC or nonMHC heterozygosity and health. NonMHC-d(2) has previously been found to predict male preferences for female faces. Thus, the current findings suggest that nonMHC diversity may play a role in both natural and sexual selection acting on human populations.",M2
19630239,"Effect of the major histocompatibility complex on the inhibition of induced cellulitis development in a broiler chicken model.The chicken major histocompatibility complex (<e>MHC</e>) has been implicated in conferring resistance or susceptibility to several bacterial, parasitic, and viral diseases, the most notable of which is Marek's disease. In Marek's disease certain MHC haplotypes have been shown to confer relative resistance (B21), whereas other haplotypes are susceptible (B13). Relatively little work has been performed looking at the association of the MHC with bacterial diseases. One such disease is cellulitis, which is caused by several different bacteria but most notably by Escherichia coli. In this report, a commercial broiler chicken line known to contain standard B13 and B21, as well as the unique MHC types BA9 and BA12, was examined in a challenge model for cellulitis. The MHC-defined birds were challenged with a cellulitis-causing E. coli isolate and the frequency of lesion development and severity was quantified. In conclusion, B21 had the highest incidence of cellulitis development, B13 had the lowest incidence, and BA9 and BA12 had intermediate results. Results concerning the lesion severity showed that it was independent of the birds' MHC type.",M2

We studied the genetic control of food allergy using major histocompatibility complex-identical mice (H2(s)) and an adjuvant-free method of sensitization. Whereas, transdermal exposure to hazelnut - a model allergenic food, elicited robust IgG1 response in both strains, an IgE response was evident only in A.SW mice. Following oral challenge, only A.SW but not SJL mice exhibited signs of systemic anaphylaxis and hypothermia. In addition, (A.SW x SJL) F1 hybrids exhibited IgE responsiveness, systemic anaphylaxis and hypothermia similar to A.SW, indicating dominant inheritance of these traits. Furthermore, whereas A.SW and F1 mice but not SJL elicited robust interleukin (IL)-4 response, all three strains elicited IL-5 and IL-13 responses by spleen cells. These data demonstrate for the first time, dominant non-MHC genetic control of food allergy and a critical role of IL-4 but not IL-5 or IL-13 in this model.",M2

Due to their high levels of polymorphism, many of them are used as markers for population studies. Here we report an investigation on four microsatellites (D6S273, D6S2792, STR_MICA and D6S2810) located within the major histocompatibility complex in a sample of 281 Southern Brazilians of European ancestry. Allelic and haplotypic frequencies are described, as well as linkage disequilibrium (LD) between alleles of these microsatellites and alleles of three HLA genes: HLA-B, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. The most polymorphic microsatellite was D6S2810, located close to the HLA-B locus. Strong LD was observed between alleles of microsatellites and HLA genes. The strongest associations occurred among STR_MICA*A5.1-HLA-B*13, STR_MICA*A6-HLA-B*49, STR_MICA*A9-HLA-B*39, STR_MICA*A9-HLAB*57, D6S2810*334-HLA-B*14, D6S2810*334-HLA-B*38, STR_MICA*A5.1-HLA-DRB1*1501-HLA-DQB1*0602 and D6S2810*344-HLA-DRB1*0411-HLA-DQB1*0302.

MHC-G evolution in primates shows some anomalies. In New World monkeys MHC-G molecules show a high polymorphism and most likely are classical antigen presenters; they also cluster closer to MHC-E in a relatedness dendrogram. Their genes lack intron 2 deletion, which is typical of all other primates in regard to MHC-G. Medium-sized Eurasian-African monkeys (Cercopithecinae) show stop codons in exon 3: only MHC-G isoforms without exon 3 are possible. Big apes such as the orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee as well as human beings show limited HLA-G polymorphism. HLA-C has not been found in medium-size Eurasian-African monkeys, but we have found MHC-C DNA sequences in more evolutionary ancient New World monkeys. Taking into account that the KIR inhibitory receptors signal is dominated by MHC-C in human beings, this suggests that both MHC-C molecules and their ligands within natural killer lymphocyte KIR also exist in the most evolutionary ancient apes (New World monkeys were present on Earth before 40 million years ago), as KIR receptors also appeared before 130 million years ago in evolution. Indeed, KIR receptor genes have recently been found in a New World monkey.",M2
