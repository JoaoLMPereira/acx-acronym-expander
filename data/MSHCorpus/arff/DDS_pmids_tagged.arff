19517101,"Pharmacokinetics of chlorproguanil, dapsone, artesunate and their major metabolites in patients during treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.OBJECTIVE: Chlorproguanil (CPG)-dapsone (<e>DDS</e>)-artesunate was in development for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The pharmacokinetics of CPG, DDS, artesunate and their metabolites chlorcycloguanil (CCG), monoacetyl dapsone (MADDS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were investigated in patients with P. falciparum given CPG-DDS alone or plus artesunate. METHODS: Adult patients from Malawi and The Gambia taking part in a phase II clinical trial were randomised to receive a 3-day treatment of CPG-DDS alone (2/2.5 mg/kg/day) or plus 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg/day artesunate. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 24 h post-first dose. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic analysis included 115 patients. For CPG, there was no significant effect of artesunate on C(max) or AUC(0-24), except the 90% confidence interval (CI) for AUC(0-24) for the 4 mg/kg artesunate dose was slightly below that for the standard bioequivalence range (90% CI 0.78, 1.11); this was not considered clinically relevant. Artesunate increased the CCG AUC(0-24) by 6-17% and C(max) by 0-16%. Artesunate had no significant effect on the rate or extent of absorption of DDS. For MADDS, artesunate increased the AUC(0-24) by 13-47% and C(max) by 8-45%. For 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg artesunate dosing, artesunate AUC(0-infinity) was 64.6, 151 and 400 ng.h/ml and C(max) 48.9, 106 and 224 ng/ml respectively; DHA AUC(0-infinity) was 538, 1,445 and 3,837 ng.h/ml and C(max) 228, 581 and 1,414 ng/ml respectively. Using a power model, the point estimates of slope were greater than 1 for artesunate AUC(0-t) by 16% and C(max) by 5% and for DHA by 39 and 21% respectively. CONCLUSION: Artesunate did not significantly affect CPG or DDS pharmacokinetics. For CCG and MADDS, small to moderate increases in exposure with artesunate dosing were observed. There was a greater than proportional increase in artesunate and DHA exposure with increasing artesunate dose. These effects are not considered to be clinically relevant. It should be noted that the CPG-DDS-artesunate programme has now been stopped following unacceptable haematological toxicity in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency during a phase III trial. In addition, the CPG-DDS combination has been withdrawn from clinical use.",M1
18713254,"A possible inhibitory action of diaminodiphenyl sulfone on tumour necrosis factor-alpha production from activated mononuclear cells on cutaneous lupus erythematosus.BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that diaminodiphenyl sulfone (<e>DDS</e>; dapsone) can bring about significant clinical improvement in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). However, the pharmacological actions of DDS in the skin lesion of patients with CLE are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to clarify the pharmacological actions of DDS on CLE. METHODS: We conducted an in vitro study to examine the effects of DDS on the mRNA expression and production of cytokines on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results. DDS suppressed mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and significantly decreased the level of TNF-alpha in culture supernatant. CONCLUSIONS: DDS may exert an anti-inflammatory action by suppressing TNF-alpha produced by activated mononuclear cells.",M1
18713227,"Hansen's disease in Portugal: multibacillary patients treated between 1988 and 2003.BACKGROUND: There is an estimate low incidence of patients with Hansen's disease in Portugal. Following the 1982 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, extended multidrug therapy (MDT) was started for multibacillary (MB) patients. Patients were then treated with rifampicine (RFP), clofazimine (CLF) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) for a minimum of 2 years or until smear negativity. The aim of this study was to evaluate MDT efficacy in our patient population. METHODS: Retrospective and descriptive study of 102 MB patients who underwent MDT from 1988 to 2003. RESULTS: The number of new MB patients has gradually increased since 1960, the first year of our consultation, due mostly to a rise in imported cases. Overall, 34% of the subjects were immigrants, mainly from former Portuguese Colonies. Forty-six patients had previously received monotherapy with DDS (mean duration of this treatment, 22 years). Relapse after MDT occurred in 9 cases (8.8%), but importantly, all relapsed cases were smear negative at least on one occasion after the end of treatment, suggesting these were true relapses rather than treatment failures. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the 2-year WHO-MDT regimen, patients with MB disease clearly face the possibility of relapse. We propose that any reduction in the duration of therapy such as the recently proposed 6-month standard MDT is likely to increase the relapse rate even further. Important issues for future consideration are the needs to identify those at risk of relapse and in need of alternative antimicrobial treatment with a prolonged clinical follow-up.",M1
18602405,"Dapsone induces oxidative stress and impairs antioxidant defenses in rat liver.Dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) is currently used in the treatment of leprosy, malaria and in infections with Pneumocystis jirovecii and Toxoplasma gondii in AIDS patients. Adverse effects of DDS involve methemoglobinemia and hemolysis and, to a lower extent, liver damage, though the mechanism is poorly characterized. We evaluated the effect of DDS administration to male and female rats (30 mg/kg body wt, twice a day, for 4 days) on liver oxidative stress through assessment of biliary output and liver content of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and expression/activities of the main antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase. The influence of DDS treatment on expression/activity of the main DDS phase-II-metabolizing system, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), was additionally evaluated. The involvement of dapsone hydroxylamine (DDS-NHOH) generation in these processes was estimated by comparing the data in male and female rats since N-hydroxylation of DDS mainly occurs in males. Our studies revealed an increase in the GSSG/GSH biliary output ratio, a sensitive indicator of oxidative stress, and in lipid peroxidation, in male but not in female rats treated with DDS. The activity of all antioxidant enzymes was significantly impaired by DDS treatment also in male rats, whereas UGT activity was not affected in any sex. Taken together, the evidence indicates that DDS induces oxidative stress in rat liver and that N-hydroxylation of DDS was the likely mediator. Impairment in the activity of enzymatic antioxidant systems, also associated with DDS-NHOH formation, constituted a key aggravating factor.",M1
18477230,"Neutrophilic, urticaria-like erythema associated with immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.A 70-year-old-male had suffered from non-pruritic, erythematous eruptions on the trunk for 3 months without any general symptoms. The individual lesions lasted for several days. Laboratory investigation showed marked elevation of serum immunoglobulin A (2235 mg/dL) with monoclonal gammopathy (IgA k-type). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance was diagnosed. Histopathological examination of the eruption revealed diffuse neutrophilic infiltration with leukocytoclasia in the dermis. There was no vasculitis. Treatment with antihistamines alone was not effective. Diaphenyl sulfone (<e>DDS</e>) at 75 mg/day dramatically improved the skin lesions. A similar case of urticarial erythema associated with IgA myeloma has been previously reported. We suggest that neutrophilic, urticaria-like erythema associated with IgA monoclonal gammopathy may be regarded as a new entity.",M1
18320064,"Open-label comparative clinical study of chlorproguanil-dapsone fixed dose combination (Lapdap) alone or with three different doses of artesunate for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.The objective of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of artesunate for use in a fixed dose combination therapy with chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPG-<e>DDS</e>) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. METHODS: Open-label clinical trial comparing CPG-DDS alone or with artesunate 4, 2, or 1 mg/kg at medical centers in Blantyre, Malawi and Farafenni, The Gambia. The trial was conducted between June 2002 and February 2005, including 116 adults (median age 27 years) and 107 children (median age 38 months) with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Subjects were randomized into 4 groups to receive CPG-DDS alone or plus 4, 2 or 1 mg/kg of artesunate once daily for 3 days. Assessments took place on Days 0-3 in hospital and follow-up on Days 7 and 14 as out-patients. Efficacy was evaluated in the Day 3 per-protocol (PP) population using mean time to reduce baseline parasitemia by 90% (PC90). A number of secondary outcomes were also included. Appropriate artesunate dose was determined using a pre-defined decision matrix based on primary and secondary outcomes. Treatment emergent adverse events were recorded from clinical assessments and blood parameters. Safety was evaluated in the intent to treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: In the Day 3 PP population for the adult group (N = 85), mean time to PC90 was 19.1 h in the CPG-DDS group, significantly longer than for the +artesunate 1 mg/kg (12.5 h; treatment difference -6.6 h [95%CI -11.8, -1.5]), 2 mg/kg (10.7 h; -8.4 h [95%CI -13.6, -3.2]) and 4 mg/kg (10.3 h; -8.7 h [95%CI -14.1, -3.2]) groups. For children in the Day 3 PP population (N = 92), mean time to PC90 was 21.1 h in the CPG-DDS group, similar to the +artesunate 1 mg/kg group (17.7 h; -3.3 h [95%CI -8.6, 2.0]), though the +artesunate 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups had significantly shorter mean times to PC90 versus CPG-DDS; 14.4 h (treatment difference -6.4 h [95%CI -11.7, -1.0]) and 12.8 h (-7.4 h [95%CI -12.9, -1.8]), respectively. An analysis of mean time to PC90 for the Day 14 PP and ITT populations was consistent with the primary analysis. Treatment emergent, drug-related adverse events were experienced in 35.3% (41/116) of adults and 70.1% (75/107) of children; mostly hematological and gastroenterological. The nature and incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. No dose-related changes in laboratory parameters were observed. Nine serious adverse events due to any cause occurred in five subjects including two cases of hemolysis believed to be associated with drug treatment (one adult, one child). One adult died of anaphylactic shock, not associated with investigational therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CPG-DDS plus artesunate demonstrated advantages over CPG-DDS alone for the primary efficacy endpoint (mean time to PC90) except in children for the 1 mg/kg artesunate dose. Based on a pre-defined decision matrix, the primary endpoint in the child group supported an artesunate dose of 4 mg/kg. Secondary endpoints also supported a 4 mg/kg artesunate dose to take forward into the remainder of the development program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00519467.",M1
18309716,"Dapsone induced acute photosensitivity dermatitis; a case report and review of literature.Dapsone is one of the main constituents of anti-leprosy treatment and has been in use for various dermatological and non-dermatological indications since the 1940s. Dapsone-induced photosensitivity is a rare complication. Only 11 cases seem to have been reported in the literature. We report a case of dapsone-induced photosensitivity in an Indian patient with leprosy, and briefly review the literature. Dapsone (diaminodiphenyl sulphone or <e>DDS</e>) is the most commonly used anti-leprosy drug since the 1940s. Apart from leprosy, it is used for various other infectious and non- infectious dermatoses as well as for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV infected patients. It is one of the main constituents of multidrug therapy (MDT) in leprosy by virtue of its anti-mycobacterial properties. It acts by interference with folate metabolism. Because of its inhibitory effect in neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophilic oxygen burst, it acts as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. Documented cutaneous adverse effects of dapsone include generalised maculopapular rash, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pustular and acneiform skin eruptions. Photosensitivity dermatitis is a very rare side-effect of dapsone and to the best of our knowledge, only 11 cases have been reported in the literature to date.",M1
17553916,"Detection of haptenated proteins in organotypic human skin explant cultures exposed to dapsone.Bioactivation of parent drug to reactive metabolite(s) followed by protein haptenation has been suggested to be a critical step in the elicitation of cutaneous drug reactions. Although liver is believed to be the primary organ of drug bioactivation quantitatively, other organs including skin may also metabolize drugs. Cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts have been shown to be capable of bioactivating sulfonamides and sulfones, giving rise to haptenated proteins. It is, however, unclear whether metabolic events in these isolated cells reflect bioactivation in vivo. Hence, split-thickness human skin explants were exposed to dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) or its arylhydroxylamine metabolite (dapsone hydroxylamine, D-NOH) and probed for protein haptenation. DDS and D-NOH were applied either epicutaneously or mixed in the medium (to mimic its entry into skin from the systemic circulation). DDS-protein adducts were readily detected in skin explants exposed to either DDS or D-NOH. Adducts were detected mainly in the upper epidermal region in response to epicutaneous application, whereas adducts were formed all over the explants when DDS/D-NOH were mixed in the culture medium. In addition, adducts were visible in HLA-DR+ cells, indicating their presence in the dendritic cell population in the skin. Our results demonstrate the ability of intact human skin to bioactivate DDS leading to protein haptenation.",M1
17220235,"Formation and uptake of arylhydroxylamine-haptenated proteins in human dendritic cells.Bioactivation of sulfonamides and the subsequent formation of haptenated proteins is believed to be a critical step in the development of hypersensitivity reactions to these drugs. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the presence of such adducts in dendritic cells (DCs) migrating to draining lymph nodes is essential for the development of cutaneous reactions to xenobiotics. Our objective was to determine the ability of human DCs to form drug-protein covalent adducts when exposed to sulfamethoxazole (SMX), dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), or their arylhydroxylamine metabolites [sulfamethoxazole hydroxylamine (S-NOH) and dapsone hydroxylamine (D-NOH)] and to take up preformed adduct. Naive and immature CD34+ KG-1 cells were incubated with SMX, DDS, or metabolites. Formation of haptenated proteins was probed using confocal microscopy and ELISA. Cells were also incubated with preformed adduct (drug-bovine serum albumin conjugate), and uptake was determined using confocal microscopy. Both naive and immature KG-1 cells were able to bioactivate DDS, forming drug-protein adducts, whereas cells showed very little protein haptenation when exposed to SMX. Exposure to S-NOH or D-NOH resulted in protein haptenation in both cell types. Both immature and naive KG-1 cells were able to take up preformed haptenated proteins. Thus, DCs may acquire haptenated proteins associated with drugs via intracellular bioactivation, uptake of reactive metabolites, or uptake of adduct formed and released by adjacent cells (e.g., keratinocytes).",M1
16857728,"Enzyme-mediated protein haptenation of dapsone and sulfamethoxazole in human keratinocytes: I. Expression and role of cytochromes P450.Cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs) are among the most common adverse drug reactions and are responsible for numerous minor to life-threatening complications. Several arylamine drugs, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), undergo bioactivation, resulting in adduction to cellular proteins. These adducted proteins may initiate the immune response that ultimately results in a CDR. Recent studies have demonstrated that normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) can bioactivate these drugs, resulting in protein haptenation. We sought to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for this bioactivation in NHEKs. Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and an adduct-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found that N-acetylation of the primary amine of SMX and DDS markedly reduced the level of protein haptenation in NHEKs. Detection of mRNA and/or protein confirmed the presence of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2E1 in NHEKs. In contrast, although a faint band suggestive of CYP2C9 protein was detected in one NHEK sample, a CYP2C9 message was not detectable. We also examined the ability of chemical inhibitors of cytochromes P450 (aminobenzotriazole and 1-dichloroethylene) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin) to reduce protein haptenation when NHEKs were incubated with SMX or DDS by either confocal microscopy or ELISA. These inhibitors did not significantly attenuate protein adduction with either SMX or DDS, indicating that cytochromes P450 and cyclooxygenase do not play important roles in the bioactivation of these xenobiotics in NHEKs and thus suggesting the importance of other enzymes in these cells.",M1
16857727,"Enzyme-mediated protein haptenation of dapsone and sulfamethoxazole in human keratinocytes: II. Expression and role of flavin-containing monooxygenases and peroxidases.Arylamine compounds, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), are metabolized in epidermal keratinocytes to arylhydroxylamine metabolites that auto-oxidize to arylnitroso derivatives, which in turn bind to cellular proteins and can act as antigens/immunogens. Previous studies have demonstrated that neither cytochromes P450 nor cyclooxygenases mediate this bioactivation in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). In this investigation, we demonstrated that methimazole (MMZ), a prototypical substrate of the flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), attenuated the protein haptenation observed in NHEKs exposed to SMX or DDS. In addition, recombinant FMO1 and FMO3 were able to bioactivate both SMX and DDS, resulting in covalent adduct formation. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of FMO3 in NHEKs, whereas FMO1 was not detectable. In addition to MMZ, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABH) also attenuated SMX- and DDS-dependent protein haptenation in NHEKs. ABH did not alter the bioactivation of these drugs by recombinant FMO3, suggesting its inhibitory effect in NHEKs was due to its known ability to inhibit peroxidases. Studies confirmed the presence of peroxidase activity in NHEKs; however, immunoblot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that myeloperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, and thyroid peroxidase were absent. Thus, our results suggest an important role for FMO3 and yet-to-be identified peroxidases in the bioactivation of sulfonamides in NHEKs.",M1
16603214,"Bioactivation, protein haptenation, and toxicity of sulfamethoxazole and dapsone in normal human dermal fibroblasts.Cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs) associated with sulfonamides are believed to be mediated through the formation of reactive metabolites that result in cellular toxicity and protein haptenation. We evaluated the bioactivation and toxicity of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Incubation of cells with DDS or its metabolite (D-NOH) resulted in protein haptenation readily detected by confocal microscopy and ELISA. While the metabolite of SMX (S-NOH) haptenated intracellular proteins, adducts were not evident in incubations with SMX. Cells expressed abundant N-acetyltransferase-1 (NAT1) mRNA and activity, but little NAT2 mRNA or activity. Neither NAT1 nor NAT2 protein was detected. Incubation of NHDF with S-NOH or D-NOH increased reactive oxygen species formation and reduced glutathione content. NHDF were less susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of S-NOH and D-NOH than are keratinocytes. Our studies provide the novel observation that NHDF are able to acetylate both arylamine compounds and bioactivate the sulfone DDS, giving rise to haptenated proteins. The reactive metabolites of SMX and DDS also provoke oxidative stress in these cells in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. Further work is needed to determine the role of the observed toxicity in mediating CDRs observed with these agents.",M1
16457769,"Multiple synergistic interactions between atovaquone and antifolates against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro: a rational basis for combination therapy.The use of synergistic drug combinations for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria is a major strategy to slow the selection and spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistant strains. In order to investigate synergistic compounds, with different modes of action, as alternative candidates for combination therapy, we used standard in vitro P. falciparum cultures and an established synergy testing method to define interactions among dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), atovaquone (ATQ), chlorproguanil (CPG) and its triazine metabolite chlorcycloguanil (CCG). Strong synergy was observed in the combinations DDS/CCG and ATQ/CPG. Multiple combination of these drugs, DDS/CCG/CPG/ATQ also exhibited high synergy although not higher than that of either of the two drug combinations separately. The use of this triple combination DDS/CPG/ATQ, even without an increase in synergy over their double combinations, ATQ/CPG and DDS/CCG, would contribute towards slowing the selection pressure since these drugs act against different targets and would delay the selection of parasites resistant to the three drugs, extending the useful therapeutic life of these valuable compounds.",M1
16289751,"Effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the toxicity of the arylhydroxylamine metabolites of sulphamethoxazole and dapsone in normal human keratinocytes.Sulphonamides, such as sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and the related sulphone dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), show a higher incidence of cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative patients. During HIV infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are increased. We hypothesized that this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase the toxicity of the arylhydroxylamine metabolites of SMX (S-NOH) and DDS (D-NOH) in keratinocytes through a reduction in glutathione (GSH) content. We evaluated the effect of TNF-alpha on GSH levels in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) and found a significant decrease in GSH after 24h. Pre-treatment with TNF-alpha also resulted in an increase in the recovery of D-NOH, but failed to alter drug-protein covalent adduct formation in NHEK. We also evaluated the effect of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and conditioned media (obtained from monocytes stimulated with LPS) on the cytotoxicity of pre-formed arylhydroxylamine metabolites in NHEK. Priming cells with cytokines did not significantly alter the cytotoxicity of the metabolites. The effect of pre-treatment with TNF-alpha on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in NHEK was also determined. While ROS formation in NHEK was increased in the presence of D-NOH, TNF-alpha did not alter the level of ROS generation. Our data suggest that the level of GSH reduction induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines does not predispose NHEK to cellular toxicity from either S-NOH or D-NOH.",M1
16214851,"Role of human cyclooxygenase-2 in the bioactivation of dapsone and sulfamethoxazole.Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, <e>DDS</e>) are believed to mediate their adverse effects subsequent to bioactivation to their respective arylhydroxylamine and arylnitroso metabolites, resulting in covalent adduct formation with intracellular proteins. Various bioactivating enzymes, such as cytochromes P450 and myeloperoxidase, have been shown to be capable of catalyzing the N-oxidation of these compounds. We assessed the role of human cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the metabolism and subsequent adduct formation of DDS and SMX using recombinant human COX-2. Using an adduct-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that the complete enzyme system gave rise to covalent adducts. However, the nonspecific COX inhibitor indomethacin did not reduce the amount of covalent adduct formed. Formation of the arylhydroxylamine metabolites was demonstrated via high performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV absorption. Metabolite formation was found to be secondary to the H2O2 in the incubation mixture and was not enzyme-mediated. Hence, COX-2 does not play a direct role in the bioactivation of these parent drugs to their arylhydroxylamine metabolites.",M1
16075742,"Trends of case detection and other indicators of leprosy in China during 1985-2002.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trends of case detection and other indicators of leprosy in China during 1985-2002. METHODS: Data reported by each province were collected by China National Leprosy Database in Nanjing P.R. China. All data about registered cases were put into computer for analysis. RESULTS: From 1985 to 2002, a total of 49,477 new leprosy cases had been detected. Among them, 69.5% were multibacillary cases and 25.4% had grade 2 disability. The child cases aged below 15 years accounted for 3.74% of total cases. Totally, 5824 cases and 303 cases relapsed after dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) mono-therapy and multidrug therapy (MDT), respectively. Case detection showed a marked reduction from 0.47/100,000 in 1985 to 0.18/100,000 in 1993 although there were several spurts due to operational factors. From 1994, case detection showed no significant decline. The grade 2 disability among new patients decreased from 31.4% in 1985 to 23.4% in 2002. The child case detection rate among new cases fluctuated between 2.70%-3.56% from 1999 to 2002. The incidence of relapse declined after the introduction of DDS mono-therapy. However, it increased after the introduction of MDT. CONCLUSION: China experiences in leprosy control show that it will take a long time with continuing present leprosy control activities to bring down the case detection and other indicators to a very low level even after reaching the elimination goal of leprosy.",M1
16004705,"The chemotherapy of rodent malaria. LXIII. Drug combinations to impede the selection of drug resistance, part 6: the potential value of chlorproguanil and dapsone in combination, and with the addition of artesunate.Resistance is readily produced in rodent malaria using the single-dose, '2%-relapse technique' (2%RT) against the individual compounds chlorproguanil (CPG), chlorcycloguanil (CCG), cycloguanil, dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) and artesunate (ASN). Using the '4-day test', a low level of synergism or a simple additional action between CPG and DDS was observed with multiple dosing of these two compounds in a combination. Resistance to a 1 : 3 combination of CPG-DDS was selected in each of three parasite lines: Plasmodium berghei NK65, P. yoelii ssp. NS and P. chabaudi AS. Of these lines, P. chabaudi AS was found to be the most sensitive to the 1 : 3 combination in the 2%RT (and was also previously found to be the most sensitive when the compounds were used individually). Plasmodium chabaudi AS was also the line found most sensitive to a 7 : 21 : 300 combination of CPG-DDS-ASN (CDA). In mice infected with P. chabaudi AS, compared with the use of the individual components, the CPG-DDS combination only a gave a modest level of protection (as indicated by the increase in the time required to select resistance in the 2%RT) but the triple CDA combination was totally effective over the duration of the experiment. New pharmacokinetic data to be reported elsewhere indicate, however, that the antimalarial action of CPG in mice is exerted by a mechanism that is not associated with the drug's conversion to the antifolate triazine, CCG. The question thus arises as to how, in the present model, the protective action of CDA was effected. The present results nevertheless reinforce the hypothesis that a CDA combination, appropriately proportioned for human use, should be of practical value, in protecting the individual components, when used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum, and possibly other Plasmodium species, in endemic areas. Clinical trials, both with a CPG-DDS combination (Lapdap) and CDA, are currently under way in tropical Africa. Further studies are now required to determine whether DDS, CPG or an as-yet unidentified metabolite of CPG interact with ASN, and whether a simple double combination of ASN with one or other of these would be as protective, against the selection of resistance, as CDA.",M1
15894292,"Reactive oxygen species generation and its role in the differential cytotoxicity of the arylhydroxylamine metabolites of sulfamethoxazole and dapsone in normal human epidermal keratinocytes.Cutaneous drug reactions (CDR) are responsible for numerous minor to life-threatening complications. Though the exact mechanism for CDR is not completely understood, evidence suggests that bioactivation of drugs to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species is an important factor in the initiation of these reactions. Several CDR-inducing drugs having an arylamine functional group, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>), undergo bioactivation to reactive arylhydroxylamine metabolites. These metabolites can generate cellular oxidative stress by forming reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several studies have demonstrated a higher cytotoxicity with DDS hydroxylamine (DDS-NOH) compared to SMX hydroxylamine (SMX-NOH). To investigate the role of differential ROS generation in the higher cytotoxicity of DDS-NOH, hydroxylamine metabolites of SMX and DDS were synthesized and ROS formation by these metabolites determined. DDS-NOH and its analogues/metabolites consistently resulted in higher ROS formation as compared to SMX-NOH. However, comparison of the ROS generation and cytotoxicity of a series of arylhydroxylamine analogues of DDS did not support a simple correlation between ROS generation and cell death. Numerous ROS scavengers were found to reduce metabolite-induced ROS formation, with differences in the potency between the agents. The decrease in DDS-NOH-induced ROS generation in NHEK with ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, Trolox, and melatonin was 87, 86, 44, and 16%, respectively. Similarly, the cytotoxicity and adduct formation of DDS-NOH in NHEK was reduced in the presence of ascorbic acid. In summary, these studies show that arylhydroxylamine metabolites of SMX/DDS induce ROS generation in NHEK, though such generation is not directly related to cytotoxicity.",M1
15863252,"Dapsone impairs the bile salt-independent fraction of bile flow in rats: Possible involvement of its N-hydroxylated metabolite.The effects of dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) treatment (30 mg/kg body wt, twice a day, for 4 days) on biliary secretory function, with special emphasis on bile salt independent bile flow (BSIF), were investigated in male and in female Wistar rats. Because DDS is metabolized to its N-hydroxylated parent compound only in male rats, any gender difference in DDS effect can be causally attributed to this metabolite. The two main driving forces for BSIF, the biliary secretion of HCO(3)(-) and glutathione species, were assessed. BSIF was decreased by about 20% in male but not in female rats after DDS treatment. Basal biliary HCO(3)(-) secretion was decreased also by 20% in males. This was associated with a diminished (-37%) expression of the HCO(3)(-) canalicular transporter, anion exchanger 2 (AE2), detected by western blotting. Biliary output of reduced glutathione (GSH) was not modified by DDS irrespective of gender, whereas excretion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was increased by 830% in males. This latter finding confirmed a gender-dependent oxidative stress associated with formation of the N-hydroxylated metabolite of DDS. The expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), a putative transporter of glutathione species, was decreased by 38% as detected by western blotting, clearly dissociating from preserved or increased biliary excretion of GSH and GSSG. In conclusion, our results show an impairment of BSIF by DDS mainly due to a decreased AE2-mediated biliary excretion of HCO(3)(-), formation of the N-hydroxylated metabolite of DDS being a likely mediator. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed.",M1
15862605,"Reduction of sulfamethoxazole and dapsone hydroxylamines by a microsomal enzyme system purified from pig liver and pig and human liver microsomes.Biotransformation involving nitrogen are of pharmacological and toxicological relevance. In principle, nitrogen containing functional groups can undergo all the known biotransformation processes such as oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and formation of conjugates. For the N-reduction of benzamidoxime an oxygen-insensitive liver microsomal enzyme system that required cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme of the subfamily 2D has been described. In previous studies it was demonstrated that N-hydroxylated derivates of strongly basic functional groups are easily reduced by this enzyme system. The N-hydroxylation of sulfonamides such sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) to sulfamethoxazole-hydroxylamine (SMX-HA) and dapsone-hydroxylamine (DDS-N-OH), respectively is the first step in the formation of reactive metabolites. Therefore it seemed reasonable to study the potential of cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and CYP2D to detoxify these N-hydroxylated metabolites by N-reduction. Metabolites were analysed by HPLC analysis. SMX-HA and DDS-N-OH are reduced by cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and CYP2D but also only by cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase without addition of CYP2D. The reduction rate for SMX-HA by cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and CYP2D was 0,65 +/- 0,1 nmol SMX/min/mg protein. The reduction rate by b5 and b5 reductase was 0,37 +/- 0,15 nmol SMX/min/mg protein. For DDS-N-OH the reduction rate by cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and CYP2D was 1.79 +/- 0.85 nmol DDS/min/mg protein and by cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 1.25 +/- 0.15 nmol DDS/min/mg protein. Cytochrome b5, NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase are therefore involved in the detoxification of these reactive hydroxylamines and CYP2D increased the N-reduction.",M1
15784651,"Characterization of the formation and localization of sulfamethoxazole and dapsone-associated drug-protein adducts in human epidermal keratinocytes.Sulfonamide- and sulfone-induced hypersensitivity reactions are thought to be mediated through bioactivation of parent drug molecule(s) to their respective reactive metabolite(s). Recent studies have demonstrated that keratinocytes can bioactivate sulfonamides and sulfones. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hapten-specific rabbit antisera developed in our laboratory, we found that incubation of either normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) or an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) resulted in the formation of drug/metabolite protein adducts. The formation of these adducts with SMX was increased in the presence of ascorbic acid, whereas N-acetylcysteine decreased adduct formation with both SMX and DDS. Adduct formation was confirmed using confocal microscopy when NHEKs were incubated with SMX, DDS, or their respective arylhydroxylamine metabolites. Cellular distribution of adducts was compared in permeable versus nonpermeable NHEKs. Exposure to SMX, DDS, or dapsone hydroxylamine resulted in the formation of intracellular adducts, whereas SMX hydroxylamine also resulted in the presence of adducts on the cell surface. In summary, our work shows that keratinocytes can bioactivate SMX/DDS to form drug-protein adducts, which may be acquired by antigen-presenting cells upon keratinocyte cell death, evoking an immune response. In addition, keratinocytes may themselves present antigen to hapten-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, our results also suggest that different sulfonamides/sulfones may have different protein targets for in situ haptenation in keratinocytes.",M1

12810994,"Acetylator phenotype in Behçet's disease.The purpose of this study was to determine the acetylator status in Behçet's disease (BD) patients and compare it to a matched group of normal individuals. Thirty-seven healthy volunteers and forty-one BD patients were included. Detailed history was taken from the patients. HLA-B51 was determined in the BD patients. In addition, the Clinical Manifestation Index (C.M.I.) was determined for each patient. Pathergy test was also done. After an overnight fast, each control subject and patient received a single oral dose of 100 mg of <e>DDS</e>. A blood sample was collected after 3 hours and the plasma was separated for determination of dapsone/monoacetyldapsone by HPLC. The frequency of slow acetylators in healthy individuals was 70.2%, while the frequency of rapid acetylators was 29.8%. The frequency of slow acetylators in BD patients was 53.7%, while the frequency of non-acetylators (undetected monoacetyldapsone MADDS in plasma) was 46.3%. There were no rapid acetylators among the BD patients. There was a strong negative association between the acetylator status and the severity of BD. In addition, acetylator status correlated with HLA-B51, in that BD patients with positive HLA-B51 were characterized by a very slow or non-acetylator status. Slow or non-acetylators had more severe BD. We conclude that BD patients have a unique acetylator status. This finding may have implications for the theories for the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for therapeutic aspects.",M1
12207764,"Perianal actinomycetoma experience of 20 cases.BACKGROUND: Actinomycetoma is a chronic infection resulting from aerobic Actinomycetes. The major agents are Nocardia brasiliensis, Actinomadura madurae, and Streptomyces somaliensis. The most frequent topographies are the lower and upper limbs. The prognosis of this disease is determined by several factors, such as etiologic agent, clinical topography, and depth of disease (degree of involvement, visceral, and bone affection). The purpose of this paper was to present our experience with actinomycetoma of the perianal region. METHODS: This study comprises 20 cases of perianal actinomycetoma, all of which were clinically and microbiologically proven by direct examinations, cultures, and biopsies. Clinical responses to the two principal treatment regimes used [combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS/SMX) and diaminodiphenylsulfone (<e>DDS</e>) or amikacine plus TMS/SMX] are reported. RESULTS: Most of the cases were male (17/20, 85%), the mean age was 42.1 years, and the farmers predominated (90%). The principal etiologic agent isolated was N. brasiliensis (85%). CONCLUSIONS: Perianal actinomycetoma is a rare entity. Differential diagnosis with anal sinuses, hydroadenitis, and cutaneous tuberculosis must be made in endemic areas by performing mycologic tests and biopsies. Treatment depends on the etiologic agent involved and the patient's condition.",M1

12030789,"Effects of H(2)-receptor antagonists on dapsone-induced methaemoglobinaemia in rats.Dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) (4,4'diaminodiphenylsulfone), the drug of choice for the treatment of leprosy, frequently induces haemolytic anaemia and methaemoglobinaemia. N-hydroxylation, one of the major pathways of biotransformation, has been constantly related to the methaemoglobinaemia observed with the use of the drug. In order to determine the reversible inhibition of this toxicologic bioactivation pathway without changing the detoxification pathways of the drug or cytosolic acetylation, cimetidine (CIM), ranitidine and famotidine were administered in combination with DDS to male Wistar rats weighing 200-220 g. The animals were divided into nine groups of eight: group 1 received a single dose of 40 mg kg (-1) DDS in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and groups 2-4 received the same treatment as group 1 but after the administration of a single dose of 100, 150 and 200 mg kg (-1) CIM, respectively, injected 2 h prior DDS administration. Groups 5-9 received the same treatment as group 2 but after the treatment of ranitidine (50 and 100 mg kg (-1) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in 200 microl DMSO) and famotidine (10, 50 and 100 mg kg (-1) i.p. in 200 microl DMSO), respectively. The animals were then anaesthetized with ether and blood was collected from the aorta for the determination of plasma DDS and monoacetyldapsone concentrations by HPLC and later for the determination of methaemoglobinaemia by spectrophotometry. CIM showed a higher affinity for cytochrome P-450 than famotidine and ranitidine. The results obtained showed the potentiality of the pharmacological effects of DDS with a low risk of adverse reactions, especially methaemoglobinaemia, which is dose dependent.",M1
11996898,"Dapsone-induced cholestasis and impairment of bile salt output in the rat.To evaluate the effect of dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, <e>DDS</e>) on biliary bile salt secretion, we administered the drug to male and female Wistar rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg body wt, twice a day, for 4 days. DDS decreased basal bile flow by about 20% in both male and female rats. In addition, basal biliary bile salt secretion was decreased by the drug in animals from both sexes (about 30% decrease). Bile salt maximum secretory rate, as evaluated by infusing tauroursodeoxycholate at stepwise-increasing rates, was not affected by DDS in either male or female rats, suggesting that the density of canalicular bile salt transporters is preserved. The size of the bile salt pool and the rate of de novo synthesis of bile salts, measured in bile salt-depleted animals, were decreased by about 33 and 35%, respectively; there was no difference in response between males and females. The ability of the ileum to reabsorb bile salts, as estimated by analysis of the expression of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter and of sodium taurocholate transport activity in brush border membrane vesicles, was not affected by DDS in either males or females. Overall, our findings suggest that an impairment of de novo synthesis mediated by a direct inhibition of CYP3A metabolism, rather than a decreased intestinal reabsorption of bile salts, accounts for the decrease in bile salt pool size. The dissociation between alteration of bile secretory function and the oxidative stress induced by DDS, which is known to be relevant only in male rats, is discussed.",M1

Human plasma was deproteinized with acetone and the clear supernatant solution after centrifugation was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 70 degrees C. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of HPLC eluent and acetone (18:5 v/v) and an aliquot of this solution (50 microL) was injected onto the HPLC column. Dapsone, hydroxylaminodapsone and diazoxide as internal standard, were separated within 10 min by isocratic elution with water:acetonitrile:glacial acetic acid:triethylamine (80:20:1.0:0.5 by volume) as eluent. Detection was by ultraviolet at the wavelength of 295 nm. The within-day repeatability coefficients of variation were 3-5% for dapsone (0.301-20.0 mg/L, n = 5) and 3-5% for hydroxylaminodapsone (0.0948-6.32 mg/L, n = 5), whereas the between-day repeatability coefficients of variation were 3-8% (0.301-20.0 mg/L, n = 5) for dapsone and 4-10% for hydroxylaminodapsone (0.0948-6.32 mg/L, n = 5). The mean recoveries -were 92-107% (0.301-20.0 mg/L, n = 2), 80-82% (0.0948-6.32 mg/L, n = 2) and 88% (0.0200 mg/mL, n = 5), for dapsone, hydroxylaminodapsone and diazoxide, respectively.

The limits of detection were 0.00200 and 0.0470 mg/L for dapsone and hydroxylaminodapsone, respectively. The method is suitable for drug level monitoring and for pharmacokinetic studies.",M1
11765001,"Oxidative stress, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the red cell.As discussed above, the process by which normal senescent red cells are selected for removal from the circulation is the subject of much ongoing research and is not yet well understood. This in turn creates a problem for studies on the enhanced removal that occurs in xenobiotic-induced hemolytic states; specifically, whether the enhanced removal should be considered as an increase in rate of the normal sequestration mechanism or as an unrelated process, in part or in whole. This difficulty bears directly on the interpretation of much of the mechanistic hemolytic literature. Because of its dual in vivo and in vitro hemolytic capability, and because of its capacity to induce frank lysis in the incubation mixture, phenylhydrazine has been used extensively as a model compound for mechanistic studies. These data have contributed heavily to our current concepts of how chemicals induce damage in the red cell. The comparison studies presented above cast doubt on the relevance of many of these phenylhydrazine studies for the in vivo hemolytic response. Phenylhydrazine, like divicine and <e>DDS</e>-NOH, shows an overwhelming predominance of uptake into the spleen, as distinct from removal by the RES system in general, as evidenced by relatively low liver uptake. This suggests strongly that damaged cells are removed intact by the spleen and do not lyse or fragment in the general circulation, at least to any significant extent. The studies with DDS-NOH indicate that neither Heinz body formation nor lipid peroxidation per se are essential steps in the process by which damaged red cells are removed from the circulation in the rat. It is not yet clear whether this lack of obligatory involvement of Heinz bodies and lipid peroxidation is peculiar to the arylhydroxylamine-induced hemolytic state or whether it will prove to be of general applicability. On the other hand, cysteamine failed to reverse the hemolytic damage caused by phenylhydrazine. Since cysteamine  rescued  DDS-NOH treated cells under the same experimental conditions, this observation raises the possibility that protein-thiol oxidation per se is also not an obligatory step in the sequence of events leading to premature sequestration. Clearly, the ratio of lipid to protein oxidation is markedly different in these three examples of hemotoxic compounds. DDS-NOH showed high protein oxidation with no discernible lipid oxidation, divicine showed both high protein and high lipid oxidation, and phenylhydrazine showed high lipid and low protein oxidation. While the significance of these markedly different patterns of injury is far from clear, it seems reasonable to conclude that there is more than one way by which chemicals damage the red cell. It is intriguing that these apparently different chemical insults within the red cell result in a common  message  on the outside of the cell, such that the cell appears as  prematurely  aged. Although the pattern of injury inside the cell may be significantly different, the process by which the three hemotoxic compounds enhance uptake by splenic macrophages may remain the same. That is, there may be a variety of insults sustained within the red cell that lead by different pathways to similar  recognition-specific  changes on the external surface of the red cell. Clearly, comparison of the effects of the three hemotoxic compounds will shed light on both the hemolytic process and on normal red cell sequestration mechanisms.",M1
11710542,"Immunohematotoxicity studies with combinations of dapsone and zidovudine.We investigated the immunohematoxicities of the antiparasitic drug dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) and the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (ZDV, AZT) given alone or in combination in BALB/c mice. DDS is used for prophylaxis and treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infection in AIDS patients. We examined the impact of concurrent administration of these drugs on the immune and hematopoietic systems because DDS causes hematotoxicity and ZDV therapy results in bone marrow toxicity. Daily oral administration of DDS at 25 and 50 mg/kg for 28 days caused a slight anemia, marked methemoglobinemia, reticulocytosis, and a moderate leukopenia (P &lt; 0.01 for all parameters) but had no discernible effect on platelet count. In DDS-treated mice, the proliferative response of splenic T cells to concanavalin A was &gt; or = 35% higher than that manifested by splenocytes from vehicle-treated control mice. ZDV at 240 and 480 mg/kg was not immunosuppressive but caused low-grade macrocytic anemia, thrombocytosis, and neutropenia; these effects were drug dose-dependent and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). Concurrent administration of DDS and ZDV augmented the severity of ZDV-mediated macrocytic anemia, and 7 of 12 (58%) mice did not survive treatment with the high doses of DDS and ZDV (50 and 480 mg/kg, respectively). On the other hand, co-administration of ZDV mitigated DDS-induced methemoglobinemia and the DDS-associated elevation in lymphoproliferative response. These data suggest interaction between DDS and ZDV in mice and indicate a need for caution in using DDS as long-term therapy in AIDS patients receiving ZDV.",M1

This program started in Malta in June 1972. It was based on extensive experimental and clinical studies and was formally concluded on 31 December 1999. No new infections occurred after the start of this 27-year progress report. The youngest patient was 16, and the eldest 83 years old. Of the total of 261 cases in the project, 201 had already received pretreatment [mainly with diaminodiphenylsulfone (<e>DDS</e>)] at the start. Sixty-one cases had no pretreatment. These were predominantly elderly patients who were late in deciding to have treatment. The very long follow-up period totaling 27 years was consistently maintained in order to be able to refute all potential objections empirically, e.g. with regard to relapses at a late stage. Besides the overall symptoms which are typical for the broad picture of leprosy, the involvement of the eyes was very striking (at least 50%). The therapeutic effect was of very rapid onset in these cases without surgery. Rifampicin (RMP) + isoniazid + prothionamide + DDS (trade name Isoprodian-RMP) was used as medication in a fixed combination. This fixed combination had already proved to be highly effective in the treatments during the course of the project, surprising therapy results (including lifesaving effects) were also noticed in other diseases.",M1
11376039,"Simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium leprae and its susceptibility to dapsone using DNA heteroduplex analysis.Currently recommended control measures for treating leprosy with multidrug therapy should control the spread of drug-resistant strains; however, dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) resistance continues to be reported. Comprehensive estimates of drug-resistant leprosy are difficult to obtain due to the cumbersome nature of the conventional drug susceptibility testing method using mouse footpad inoculation, which requires at least 6 months to obtain results. Recently, it has been determined that DDS-resistant strains contain missense mutations in codon 53 or 55 of the folP1 gene of Mycobacterium leprae, and definitive evidence linking these mutations with DDS resistance in M. leprae has been obtained. Based on these mutations, a heteroduplex DDS M. leprae (HD-DDS-ML) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of M. leprae and of its susceptibility to DDS. The assay relies on the PCR amplification of an M. leprae-specific 231-bp fragment of folP1 containing codons 53 and 55. The PCR products are allowed to anneal to a universal heteroduplex generator, and the separation of the resultant DNA duplexes is accomplished by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. M. leprae was detected in crude cell lysates of skin biopsy specimen homogenates from eight leprosy patients and from M. leprae-infected mouse or armadillo tissues infected with 14 separate strains using the HD-DDS-ML assay. The assay was specific for M. leprae in a comparison with results obtained from 14 species of mycobacteria other than M. leprae and four bacterial species known to colonize human skin. The HD-DDS-ML assay detected as few as 100 M. leprae organisms present in homogenates of human skin and demonstrated a 93% correlation with DDS susceptibility as determined by both DNA sequencing of folP1 and mouse footpad susceptibility testing. The HD-DDS-ML assay provides a new tool for the simultaneous detection of M. leprae and of its susceptibility to DDS from a single specimen. The assay should prove useful for drug resistance surveillance in leprosy control programs when combined with similar molecular tests developed for other drug resistance markers.",M1
11201896,"Dapsone resistance in Mycobacterium leprae.The folP1 gene of Mycobacterium leprae, which encodes dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), was studied for the presence of mutations associated with resistance to dapsone (<e>DDS</e>).

One mutation occurred at codon 53, substituting isoleucine for threonine in DHPS-1, and a second mutation occurred in codon 55, substituting arginine for proline. DNA sequencing of strains of M. leprae resistant to 0.01 g% DDS in the mouse diet revealed that 13 of 14 strains contained either the 53 or 55 folP1 mutation. None of the susceptible strains and only one of five strains resistant to 0.001 g% DDS revealed a mutation in folP1, suggesting that only high-level DDS resistance is associated with the mutations identified in folP1. Development and application of simple molecular tests to assess drug-related mutations in M. leprae could establish current levels of drug resistance in leprosy as a reference point for future monitoring of drug resistance at the global level.",M1
11174140,"Dapsone-induced photodermatitis in a patient with linear IgA dermatosis.Dapsone (4, 4' diaminodiphenylsulfone) is an efficient antiinflammatory agent. Its therapeutic use may result in a variety of adverse effects. The most frequent unwanted reactions are hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. By oral route dapsone is mainly metabolized to monoacetyldapsone (MADDS) and hydroxylamine dapsone (<e>DDS</e>-NOH). We report a 76-year-old female patient with linear IgA dermatosis who developed a dapsone-induced photosensitivity 8 weeks after initiation of sulfone therapy. She showed a widespread erythematous eruption in UV-exposed skin area. After clearing of skin lesions the photopatch test revealed positive reactions to dapsone, MADDS and DDS-NOH. Dapsone-induced photosensitivity to date has been described only in leprosy patients. We demonstrate for the first time that this adverse reaction is not restricted to leprosy and that dapsone metabolites may also contribute to the mechanism of photosensitivity like the parent sulfone. Dapsone-induced photosensitivity is a rare, not dose-related adverse effect of the sulfone and can also occur in patients with inflammatory skin disorders.",M1
10973160,"Clinical and laboratory parameters in dapsone acute intoxication.OBJECTIVE: To determine the severity of dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) acute intoxication - an uncommon medical event - using clinical and laboratory parameters. METHODS: Two hundred and seventy four patients with acute DDS intoxication, aged 1 month to 50 years old, were studied and classified into four age groups. Clinical evaluation was assessed through a protocol and correlated with laboratory parameters. Spectrophotometric methods were used to analyze methemoglobinemia (MHbp) and dapsonemia (DDSp). RESULTS: The most prevalent clinical sign of intoxication was cyanosis, seen in 65.7% of the patients and in 100% of children less than 5 years of age. According to laboratory criteria, MHbp-related severe clinical intoxication was seen in 56.2% and DDSp-related occurred in 58% of the patients. Regarding DDSp, intoxication was considered severe when 20 tablets (100 mg each) were ingested, a median of 29 microg/ml. Regarding MHbp, intoxication was severe when 7.5 tablets were ingested, a median of 38% of the total Hb. The correlation between MHbp and DDSp was statistically significant (n=144, r=0.32, p&lt;0.05). Negative correlation was observed between MHbp and the time elapsed since DDS intake (n=124, r=-0.34, p&lt;0.001). There was also a negative correlation between DDSp and the time elapsed since DDS intake (n=63, r=-0.35, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis showed a significant association between methemoglobinemia and the time elapsed after the intake (t), according to the equation: Dapsonemia = 12.9256 - 0.0682t + 0.234 methemoglobinemia",M1

Sulfaphenazole (2.16 microM) and tolbutamide (500 microM), selective inhibitors of CYP2C9 (or 2C8/9), inhibited DDS-NHY by 48 +/- 14 and 41 +/- 15%, respectively. The apparent Michaelis-Menten Km values for DDS-NHY by cloned CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19 were 75 microM, 31 microM, 25 microM, and greater than 1 mM, respectively. CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 were incapable of DDS-NHY at 4 microM DDS. S-mephenytoin (360 microM) activated DDS-NHY by human liver microsomes and by CYP2C8 by 43 +/- 36 and 193 +/- 16%, respectively. This activation was cytochrome b5-dependent. In contrast, S-mephenytoin inhibited DDS-NHY by CYP2C9, CYP2C18, and CYP2C19 by 27 +/- 2, 49 +/- 1, and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. Because CYP2C18 and CYP19 are expressed at low concentrations in the human liver, these observations indicate that at clinical DDS concentrations, CYP2C9 is a major and CYP2C8 is a likely minor contributor to DDS-NHY in human liver microsomes.",M1

In vitro cytotoxicity of hydroxylamine metabolites toward peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been proposed as a marker for these HS reactions. To test the validity of this in vitro system, we determined the selective susceptibility of PBMCs from HIV-infected patients to the cytotoxic effects of hydroxylamine metabolites of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and dapsone (<e>DDS</e>). Concentration-cytotoxic response data were collected using PBMCs from 12 sulfa-HS (10 SMX-HS and 2 SMX/DDS-HS) and 10 sulfa-tolerant HIV-infected individuals. Although sulfamethoxazole hydroxylamine (SMX-NOH) and dapsone hydroxylamine (DDS-NOH) both caused concentration-dependent increases in cell death, DDS-NOH was significantly more potent in each subject (P &lt;.0001). A comparison of a variety of mean data for sulfa-HS and -tolerant patient populations failed to demonstrate the increased susceptibility of PBMCs from HS patients, noted by others, to either SMX-NOH or DDS-NOH. Moreover, any trend toward an increased susceptibility of PBMCs from HS patients was eliminated when adjusted for control cell death. PBMCs from sulfa-HS patients showed significantly greater susceptibility to the stress of short term in vitro incubation (P &lt;. 02). Mean (S.D.) vehicle control cell death values were 24.1% (7.6%) for HS patients and 17.1% (4.4%) for tolerant patients. No significant correlation was observed between hydroxylamine-induced or control cell death and any of the recorded clinical parameters. Although several potential reasons are proposed to explain the disparity with past investigations, the data suggest that in vitro cytotoxicity is not a valid marker for HS reactions in HIV-infected individuals using currently accepted experimental procedures.",M1
10565223,"[Diaminodiphenyl sulfone therapy for refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura--long-term effectiveness and possible mechanisms]Eight patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) refractory to corticosteroids were given oral diaminodiphenyl sulfone (<e>DDS</e>) (75 mg to 150 mg/day). Responses to DDS were observed in 5 patients, and their platelet counts significantly increased to more than 10 x 10(4)/microliter. The duration of treatment required to obtain platelet counts of more than 10 x 10(4)/microliter ranged from 35 to 64 days. In 3 of the 5 responsive patients, platelet counts stabilized at over 10 x 10(4)/microliter during DDS therapy for 3 to 6 years. Although adverse effects including local skin rash and itching were observed in 3 patients, they disappeared after suspension of DDS or in response to medication with antihistamines. Although the exact mechanism by which it increases the platelet counts in ITP patients is still obscure, DDS may inhibit the reticuloendothelial system by excessive red blood cell destruction. We concluded that DDS therapy is well-tolerated and seems to be an effective alternative treatment for patients with ITP that is refractory to other conventional therapies.",M1
10467955,"The effect of pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dapsone in rats.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) on the interconversion pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dapsone. To determine microsomal CYP3A activity and protein, eight rats (4 PCN, 4 corn oil) received a 1 mg kg(-1) intravenous bolus dose of dapsone, followed by blood and urine sampling. The formation clearance of dapsone hydroxylamine (CLf <e>DDS</e>-NOH) was calculated from the obtained samples. Interconversion pharmacokinetics estimates were obtained after 10 rats (5 PCN, 5 control) received 1 mg kg(-1) dapsone or 1.17 mg kg(-1) monoacetyldapsone, with a 24-h wash-out. Results from the interconversion analysis demonstrated that PCN significantly increased systemic clearance (CLs) of dapsone, but not its interconversion. The in-vivo/in-vitro correlation study demonstrated that PCN significantly increased CLs of dapsone (8.55 to 16.39mLmin(-1); P&lt;0.01) and CLf DDS-NOH (0.13 to 0.18mLmin(-1); P&lt;0.01). PCN treatment produced a 69% increase in CYP3A protein, and increased 6beta- and 2beta-hydroxytestosterone formation rates. Significant correlations were found between CLf DDS-NOH and either 6beta- (r2 = 0.925), 2beta-hydroxytestosterone (r2 = 0.92), or CYP3A1/2 protein (r2= 0.60). We conclude that PCN treatment produces significant increases in CLs (dapsone) and CLf (DDS-NOH) in rats. These changes were not due to changes in the reversible metabolism of dapsone. These results suggest that the formation clearance of dapsone hydroxylamine reflects alterations in CYP3A activity, despite the fact that it accounted for a small part of the systemic clearance of dapsone.",M1
10439322,"Dapsone resistance does not appear to be associated with a mutation in the dihydropteroate synthase-2 gene of Mycobacterium leprae.Evidence suggests that resistance to dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) in Mycobacterium leprae is related to the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). Two M. leprae genes (folP-1 and folP-2) encoding DHPS-1 and DHPS-2, respectively, have been identified through the M. leprae genome project. We have studied DDS-susceptible and resistant strains of M. leprae to determine whether the DDS-resistant phenotype is associated with a mutation(s) in folP-2 and to establish the number of genomic copies of the gene encoding DHPS-2 (folP-2). RFLP analysis of genomic DNA from DDS-susceptible and resistant strains of M. leprae exhibited a unique 4.2 kb restriction fragment consistent with a single genomic copy of folP-2 in both phenotypes. DNA encoding folP-2 was amplified by PCR and sequenced from two susceptible and two resistant strains of M. leprae. The folP-2 sequences from these strains were identical indicating that resistance to DDS was not associated with mutation(s) in the gene encoding DHPS-2.",M1
10073326,"Pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate and dapsone in AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate and dapsone in AIDS patients with moderate to severe pneumocystis pneumonia. Trimetrexate, leucovorin, and dapsone were administered for 21 +/- 3 days in the following doses: trimetrexate glucuronate, 45 mg/m2; leucovorin, 20 mg/m2; and dapsone, 100 mg daily. The pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate, dapsone, and dapsone's metabolite, monoacetyldapsone, were determined at three separate periods over the course of treatment. Serial blood samples were obtained over 24 hours after dosing and analyzed for trimetrexate, dapsone, and monoacetyldapsone, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. The mean parameters obtained for the early, mid-, and late collection periods were the following: trimetrexate: t1/2 = 8.29, 9.15, 10.00 hr; AUC = 16.85, 22.38, 24.49 mg.hr/l; CI = 5.58, 4.14, 3.96 l/hr, respectively. <e>DDS</e>: t1/2 = 14.99, 16.59, 15.13 hr; AUC = 30.60, 35.29, 36.08 mg.hr/l; CI = 3.82, 3.49, 3.01 l/hr, respectively. Monoacetyldapsone: t1/2 = 20.25, 18.66, 16.32 hr; AUC = 24.05, 24.06, 23.86 mg.hr/l, respectively. No statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetics for trimetrexate or dapsone were observed over the 21 +/- 3 day course of treatment.

10066962,"Breaking the relentless course of Hallopeau's acrodermatitis by dapsone.We report the case of a 74-year-old man who suffered for four years from recurrent generalized pustular eruptions associated with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH). Initial therapy using topical corticosteroids, tars and PUVA failed to improve the acral lesions. The disease was also unresponsive to systemic therapy using corticosteroids, methotrexate, etretinate, acitretine and cyclosporin A. Serious side-effects were experienced with these drugs. A marked improvement of the generalized pustules was observed under treatment combining etretinate and methotrexate, without having any effect on the acropustulosis. During hospitalization, a topical tar therapy cleared the pustular rash. Again no effect was observed on the acral lesions. Disulone (<e>DDS</e>) therapy, initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day, completely cleared ACH after 4 weeks. The disease relapsed when the dose was reduced to 100 mg/day. Increasing the DDS to 150 mg/day was rapidly followed by a new clearance of the acral lesions. After a 3-month treatment, the patient has remained lesion free and no DDS-related side-effects have occurred. In conclusion, sulfones may be considered as an alternative therapeutic option in drug-resistant ACH.",M1

10027831,"Methemoglobin formation by hydroxylamine metabolites of sulfamethoxazole and dapsone: implications for differences in adverse drug reactions.Differences in the incidence of adverse drug reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and dapsone may result from differences in the formation, disposition, toxicity, and/or detoxification of their hydroxylamine metabolites. In this study, we examine whether differences in the biochemical processing of sulfamethoxazole hydroxylamine (SMX-NOH) and dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH) by erythrocytes [red blood cells (RBCs)] contribute to this differential incidence. The methemoglobin (MetHgb)-forming capacity of both metabolites was compared after a 60-min incubation with washed RBCs from four healthy human volunteers. DDS-NOH was significantly more potent (P =.004) but equally efficacious with SMX-NOH in its ability to form MetHgb. The elimination of potential differences in disposition by lysing RBCs did not change the MetHgb-forming potency of either hydroxylamine. At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, greater reduction to the parent amine occurred with DDS-NOH. Maintenance of MetHgb-forming potency was dependent on recycling with glutathione, but no difference in cycling efficiency was observed between DDS-NOH and SMX-NOH. In contrast, the pharmacodynamics of hydroxylamine-induced MetHgb formation were not changed by pretreatment with the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor epiandrosterone or by compounds that alter normal antioxidant enzyme activity. Methylene blue, which stimulates NADPH-dependent MetHgb reductase activity, decreased MetHgb levels but did not alter the differential potency of these hydroxylamines. DDS-NOH was also significantly more potent when incubated with purified human hemoglobin A0. Collectively, these data suggest that the inherently greater reactivity of DDS-NOH with hemoglobin, the greater conversion of DDS-NOH to its parent amine, and potential differences in disposition of hydroxylamine metabolites may contribute to the preferential development of dapsone-induced hemotoxicity and sulfamethoxazole-induced hypersensitivity reactions.",M1
9864266,"Role of lipid peroxidation in dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia.Dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH) is a direct-acting hemolytic agent responsible for dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in the rat. The hemolytic activity of DDS-NOH is associated with the formation of disulfide-linked hemoglobin adducts on membrane skeletal proteins. We have postulated that this membrane protein  damage  is a consequence of DDS-NOH-induced oxidative stress within the red cell and that it serves as the trigger for premature removal of injured but intact red cells from the circulation by splenic macrophages. Oxidative stress has also been associated with the induction of lipid peroxidation, and it is possible that direct damage to the lipoidal membrane may play a role in the premature sequestration of the damaged cells in the spleen. To investigate this possibility, rat and human red cells were incubated with hemolytic concentrations of DDS-NOH and examined for evidence of lipid peroxidation using two independent assays: thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances formation and cis-paranaric acid degradation. Phenylhydrazine, which is known to induce lipid peroxidation in red cells, was used as a positive control. The extent of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances formation and cis-paranaric acid degradation in DDS-NOH-treated rat and human red cells was not significantly different from that in control cells. In contrast, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances formation and cis-paranaric acid degradation were significantly increased in red cells treated with hemolytic concentrations of the positive control, phenylhydrazine. These data suggest that lipid peroxidation is not involved in the mechanism underlying dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia.",M1
9372643,"Haematological and biochemical alterations in leprosy patients already treated with dapsone and MDT.Dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) is useful in the treatment of a number of inflammatory conditions which are characterized by neutrophil infiltration. It is the drug of choice for the treatment of leprosy and prophylaxis of malaria. Haematological side effects of methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis have been long recognized. However, the frequency and severity of these side effects in patients already treated with DDS as a single drug or as part of a multidrug therapy (MDT) have not been well documented. We report herein an investigation of the effect of dapsone long-term treatment on the haematological and biochemical alterations in leprosy patients undergoing dapsone as a single drug (DDS group) or as part of a multidrug therapy in combination with rifampin and clofazimine (MDT group). Methaemoglobinaemia and haemolytic anaemia were the principal side effects observed. Reticulocytes were found to be elevated (&gt; 1.5%) in 90% of the patients. Heinz bodies were also detected (6.6% of the patients). The osmotic fragility test showed a reduction in cell resistance and in the evaluation of white cells a severe eosinophilia was found. Hepatic, pancreatic and renal evaluation by the determination of biochemical parameters showed rare and occasional changes of no apparent clinical significance. We conclude that haematological side effects of dapsone are significant even at doses currently used to treat leprosy (100 mg/day) and that rifampin and clofazimine do not increase the incidence of these effects during long-term treatment.",M1
9372316,"Dapsone hydroxylamine inhibits the LTB4-induced chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into human skin: results of a pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Dapsone (4,4'diaminodiphenylsulfone) is effective in treating leprosy, chronic inflammatory conditions and opportunistic infections in HIV patients. By the oral route, the sulfone is metabolized to monoacetyldapsone (MADDS) and dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH). We have addressed the question as to whether these dapsone metabolites have anti-inflammatory properties of their own in vivo. TREATMENT AND METHODS: After two weeks topical pre-treatment with MADDS (1%), DDS-NOH (1%) and clobetasol proprionate (CP; 0.05%) dissolved in acetone, as a reference, 10 ng leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were applied on the upper arms of eight healthy volunteers. After 24 h, biopsies were taken and the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were quantified fluorometrically using elastase as marker enzyme. RESULTS: MADDS did not show any inhibitory activity on trafficking of PMN compared to the corresponding control and nontreated area (untreated: 790 +/- 450 PMN/10 micrograms skin; p &gt; 0.05, acetone: 840 +/- 578 PMN/10 micrograms skin; MADDS: 1099 +/- 556 PMN/10 micrograms skin), whereas DDS-NOH caused a statistically significant inhibition of PMN accumulation as did the reference CP (DDS-NOH: 128 +/- 143 PMN/10 micrograms skin; CP: 86 +/- 131 PMN/10 micrograms skin, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DDS-NOH has anti-inflammatory potential which might contribute to the effectiveness of dapsone therapy.",M1

KRM displayed increased efficacy in combination with OFLX, CFZ, and DDS (given three or six times per week) when given to mice in the multidrug combination KRM + OFLX + CFZ + DDS. The therapeutic efficacy of KRM given at 4-week intervals was increased by combined use with IFN-gamma but not by GM-CSF.

However, 3 weeks after the start of DDS, he suffered from edematous eruption on the cheeks and neck, enlargement of the pharynx, systemic lymphoadenopathy and hepatomegaly. In addition, his leukocyte count increased rapidly from 10.1 x 10(9)/l with 13% monocytes just before the start of DDS, to 24.6 x 10(9)/l with 28% monocytes. Bone marrow aspirate showed trilineage dysplasia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was diagnosed. The patient died from septic shock during neutropenia following cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this case, CMML was complicated with DH and the administration of DDS accelerated the progression of CMML with the manifestations of DDS syndrome. Although DDS is a well-established drug for DH, DDS should be used with great caution when a hematological malignancy coexists.",M1

The unacceptably high relapse rate indicated that 4 weeks of treatment with daily RMP-OFLO was unable to reduce the number of viable Mycobacterium leprae organisms to a negligible level. In addition, the M. leprae from one of the relapses were proved to have multiple resistance to DDS, RMP, and OFLO.

9207752,"Daily multidrug therapy for leprosy; results of a fourteen-year experience.Between 1980 and 1994, 67 new or relapsing leprosy patients were treated by daily administered multidrug regimens.

Lepromatous patients (44 BB/BL/LL) received tritherapy (RMP + DDS and/or CLO and/or ETH) at least until bacteriological negativity. Of the 23 tuberculoid patients only one patient (5%) was cured at 6 months and about 70% needed between 6 and 24 months of treatment to obtain clinical cure (mean 19.5 months). In the 44 lepromatous patients, the achievement of bacteriological negativity was significantly linked to the initial bacterial index (BI), and it occurred after 2 to 7 years (mean 66.5 months) of multidrug therapy (MDT). The average BI decrease per year was 1.1+ during the first year, 0.9+ the second year, and then &lt; 0.5+ per year. Reactional states significantly (p &lt; 0.01) influenced the BI course: reversal reactions (RR) accelerated while erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) delayed the BI decrease. Three of the 23 (13%) tuberculoid and 19 of the 44 (43%) lepromatous patients (p &lt; 0.02) exhibited a RR and 18 of 44 (41%) lepromatous patients had ENL during MDT. A late RR (LRR) was observed in 1 (5%) and 6 (17%) of our tuberculoid and lepromatous patients, respectively, and 3 (8%) of our lepromatous patients suffered post-MDT ENL.

When compared to the recommended WHO/MDT, it appears that daily MDT does not increase the clinical or the bacteriological cure rates either at 6 months in paucibacillary tuberculoid patients or at 2d years in multibacillary lepromatous patients. Moreover, as does the WHO/MDT, our regimens show a high frequency of reactional states both during and after treatment.

This study investigated whether Vitamin E would have a protective effect on the red cell membrane from oxidant damage caused by Dapsone in patients with leprosy. We have studied 16 patients for 4 months, divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 7) dapsone (<e>DDS</e>): 100 mg/day; Group 2 (n = 9) dapsone: 100 mg/day in addition with Vitamin E: 800 U/day. We did not include patients with low levels of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) because of their sensibility to this drug. At the beginning of the treatment we determined the level of G-6-PD. All patients showed a normocytic normochromic anemia with a decrease in Haptoglobine levels (below 5 mg/dl). Statistical analyses showed that reticulocyte counts did not present significant differences between groups all through evolution. As for methemoglobin (Hi) we observed in Group 1 an increase between the first and the fourth month, which was not seen in group 2. Statistical analyses of the results suggest that oral Vitamin E confers partial protective effect and does not correct the hemolysis parameters produced by Dapsone treatment except for Hi levels which were more sensitive to the oxidant damage.",M1
9098092,"Formation of free radicals and protein mixed disulfides in rat red cells exposed to dapsone hydroxylamine.The hemolytic activity of dapsone is well known to reside in its N-hydroxylamine metabolites. Addition of dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH) to red cell suspensions causes damage such that when reintroduced into the circulation of isologous rats, the injured cells are rapidly removed by the spleen. Hemolytic activity is associated with the extensive formation of disulfide-linked hemoglobin adducts on red cell membrane skeletal proteins. To determine if free radicals could be involved in this process, rat red cells were incubated with DDS-NOH in the presence of the spin trap, 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and subjected to EPR analysis. Addition of DDS-NOH (25-50 microM) to a red cell suspension gave rise to a four-line (1:2:2:1) EPR spectrum with coupling constants identical to those of a DMPO-hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO-OH) standard. No other radicals were detected; however, preincubation of red cells with cysteamine caused the DDS-NOH-generated DMPO-OH signal to be replaced by a cysteamine thiyl radical adduct signal. DDS-NOH-treated red cells were also found to contain ferrylhemoglobin, indicating the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, DDS-NOH was found to stimulate salicylate hydroxylation in red cell suspensions, confirming the presence of oxygen radicals. These data support the hypothesis that oxygen radicals are involved in the mechanism underlying dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia.",M1

EPM displayed excellent activity against staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, and streptococci which was considerably better than that of trimethoprim (TMP). EPM was also active against TMP-resistant strains, although the MICs were still relatively high. Its combination with dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) was synergistic and showed as in vitro activity superior to that of the TMP combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMZ). The EPM-DDS (ratio, 1:19) combination inhibited more than 90% of all important gram-positive pathogens at a concentration of 2 + 38 micrograms/ml. Only a few highly TMP-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were not inhibited. EPM was also more active than TMP against Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Bacteroides spp., but it was less active than TMP against all other gram-negative bacteria tested. Atypical mycobacteria were poorly susceptible to EPM, but the combination with DDS was synergistic and active at concentrations most probably achievable in biological fluids (MICs from 0.25 +/- 4.75 to 4 + 76 micrograms/ml).

7620528,"Neuropathological analysis of dementia in a Japanese leprosarium.In a neuropathological study of consecutive autopsies, prevalence and cause of dementia in a Japanese leprosarium were investigated, where more than 95% of inpatients with a mean age of 70 years are now free from active leprosy. In 10 years (1983-1992), clinically overt dementia at death was 35/136 (25.7%) in the age group over 65 years (mean age 79.4). Autopsy was performed in 85 cases (mean age 81 years), and clinically overt dementia was seen in 25 subjects (29.4%). Neuropathologically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) was seen in 9 cases (10.6%), vascular dementia (VD) in 9 cases (10.6%), mixed type in 3 cases (3.5%) and unclassified in 4 cases (4.7%). In the age group of 65-84 years, AD was 5/58 (8.6%), VD was 4/58 (6.9%), mixed type was 2/58 (3.4%), and unclassified was 1/58 (1.7%). Compared with previous Japanese general population-based data, where VD was more frequent than AD, the rate of dementia in our leprosarium was high, and pathologically confirmed AD was as common as VD. Recently, a prophylactic effect of the antileprosy and anti-inflammatory drug <e>DDS</e> (dapsone, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone) has been suggested. Lepromatous patients take more DDS (51.9%) than tuberculoid patients (11.5%), however, as the dementia rate of tuberculoid leprosy (17.9%) in those 65-84 years old is similar to lepromatous leprosy (15.9%) in our study, we do not support their viewpoint.",M1

Limit of quantitation using 150 microliters whole blood dried on filter paper was found to be 20 ng/ml for DDS and PYR and 15 ng/ml for MADDS (precision &lt; 15%). The clinically relevant concentrations of DDS are 50-2,000 ng/ml and for PYR 25-150 ng/ml. No interference from several drugs were observed. The accuracy of the filter paper method and the original whole-blood method was almost comparable. Standardization could therefore be obtained by the more simple whole-blood method. Dried filter paper samples stored at 19-22 degrees C were stable for months and for 2 weeks stored at 35 degrees C. The concentrations of simultaneously collected capillary blood and conventional venous blood samples correlated well. The present method using capillary blood dried on filter paper is reliable, simple, sensitive, and applicable in the field with limited technical facilities.",M1

7641572,"Dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia.Dapsone, an old drug introduced and used almost exclusively for the treatment of leprosy, is now utilized in an increasing number of therapeutic situations. However, its hemotoxicity is potentially severe and is often dose limiting. Effective countermeasures, based on resolution of the mechanisms underlying dapsone-induced hemotoxicity, could significantly enhance the therapeutic value of the drug. In studies on rat red cells, we have established that the N-hydroxy metabolites of dapsone, <e>DDS</e>-NOH and MADDS-NOH, are direct-acting hemolytic agents, that they are formed in amounts sufficient to account for the hemotoxicity of the parent drug, and that the action of these toxic metabolites in the red cell induces premature sequestration by the spleen. Incubation of rat red cells with hemolytic concentrations of arylhydroxylamines leads to the generation of hydroxyl, glutathiyl, and hemoglobinthiyl radicals, and the formation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides. Disulfide-linked adducts are also formed between membrane skeletal proteins and hemoglobin monomers, as well as between the monomeric hemoglobin units forming dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. Profound morphological changes are seen with change from normal discoidocity to an extreme nonspherocytic enchinocyte shape. Parallel studies with human red cells indicate that the response of human cells is qualitatively similar but that there are notable differences in regard to skeletal membrane effects. A working hypothesis for the mechanism underlying dapsone hemolytic activity is proposed.",M1

Concentration-response curves for the two metabolites were generated in vitro in whole blood. Data were fit to both the Emax and Sigmoid Emax models. The Emax values for MetHgb formation in rat blood for MADDS-NOH and DDS-NOH fitted to the Emax model were 83 (8) and 84 (2)%, while the EC50 values were 1087 (283) and 828 (104) microM, respectively (mean +/- SD). Neither these values nor those generated for the Sigmoid Emax model differed significantly between the two metabolites. Similarly, the Emax values in human blood for MADDS-NOH and DDS-NOH fitted to the Emax model were 79 (5) and 80 (2)%, while the EC50 values were 90 (17) and 95 (19) microM, respectively. These values also did not differ between the two metabolites using either pharmacodynamic model. MetHgb was produced at the same rate, reached similar peak concentrations, and exhibited the same rate of decline with both metabolites. The area under the MetHgb content versus time curve did not differ between the two metabolites. These data demonstrate that MADDS-NOH and DDS-NOH are equipotent and equally efficacious in their MetHgb-forming ability. Investigation of the disposition of these metabolites is necessary to assess their relative role in dapsone-induced toxicity in vivo.",M1

The pharmacokinetics of DDS, monoacetyldapsone (MADDS; a known metabolite), and various L- and D-amino acid derivatives of DDS were investigated in New Zealand white rabbits after intravenous administration. DDS and MADDS exhibit reversible kinetics and establish a pseudoequilibrium in vivo. In this study, the analytical procedure assayed for both DDS and MADDS, with formation of MADDS accounting for approximately 25% of the clearance of DDS. The L-amino acid derivatives of DDS were rapidly (t1/2 &lt; 2 min) and quantitatively converted to DDS after intravenous administration to rabbits. Data are consistent with conversion of the L-amino acid amides to DDS by the action of stereospecific aminopeptidase enzymes and suggest that they would be good prodrug candidates. The corresponding D-amino acid derivatives were also quantitatively converted to DDS, but the half-lives ranged from 30 to 60 min. The specific mechanism for conversion of the D-amino acid amides to DDS is unknown.",M1
7956732,"Evidence that the biotransformation of dapsone and monoacetyldapsone to their respective hydroxylamine metabolites in rat liver microsomes is mediated by cytochrome P450 2C6/2C11 and 3A1.The formation of dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH) and monoacetyldapsone hydroxylamine (MADDS-NOH) was found to be greater in male vs. female rat liver microsomes, suggesting a role for either CYP2C11 or CYP3A2. Preincubation with cimetidine (selective for inhibition of CYP2C11), but not troleandomycin (selective for inhibition of CYP3A1/2), inhibited metabolite formation. Furthermore, incubation with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to CYP2C6/2C11 reduced metabolite formation to below the level of detection. Together, these data indicate that N-hydroxylation of DDS and MADDS in rat liver microsomes from untreated male rats is catalyzed by CYP2C6/2C11. Interestingly, dexamethasone pretreatment increased the hydroxylation of both metabolites. Preincubation with cimetidine or Mabs to CYP2C6/2C11 (at an antibody:protein ratio of 26:1) in microsomes from dexamethasone pretreated animals did not reduce the N-hydroxylation of DDS, whereas preincubation with troleandomycin reduced metabolite formation by &gt; or = 50%. Collectively, these data indicate that the constitutive enzymes CYP2C6 and/or CYP2C11, as well as CYP3A1 (nonconstitutive), are capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of DDS and MADDS.",M1

This relapse rate was higher for older patients as well as for patients with 3 or more lesions. The probability of cure at 3 years is 0.816 for C2 and 0.823 for C4, the difference not being statistically significant. The probability of cure at 3 years with either regimen is higher for patients with 1 or 2 lesions (0.872) than for patients with 3 or more lesions (0.787), and it is higher for patients with a bacterial index of 0 (0.831) than for patients with a bacterial index of 1 (0.699).

In vitro anti-M. leprae activities of KRM-1648, CFZ, and DDS along with their combinations were measured by the BACTEC 460 TB System. KRM-1648 (0.01 microgram/ml), CFZ (0.5 microgram/ml), and DDS (2.0 micrograms/ml exhibited a significant anti-M. leprae activity, reducing growth index (GI) values by 78%, 30%, and 35% by day 18, respectively. Combinations of KRM-1648 with either CFZ or DDS, or both caused only a slight increase in the efficacy. BALB/c nude mice infected subcutaneously with 1 x 10(6) of M. leprae Thai-53 strain and test drugs were given to mice by gavage once daily six times per week for up to 50 days, from day 31 to day 80.

8149877,"Monoacetyldapsone inhibition of dapsone N-hydroxylation by human and rat liver microsomes.Dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) is metabolized by N-hydroxylation and N-acetylation to DDS hydroxylamine (DDS-NOH) and monoacetyldapsone (MAD), respectively. The activities of these two alternative and independent reactions vary widely between individuals and show an inverse relationship during chronic DDS therapy. Toxicity observed during DDS therapy has been attributed to DDS-NOH. The observation of reduced toxicity in rapid acetylators, who are also poor hydroxylators, therefore, raised the possibility that MAD may be inhibiting DDS-NOH formation. This hypothesis was tested in human and rat liver microsomes. Human liver microsomes hydroxylated DDS with a lower affinity (KM 2-fold greater) and lower maximal catalytic activity (Vmax 12-fold lower) than that of the rat. The relative catalytic activity (Vmax/KM) was 22-fold higher in rat compared with human liver microsomes. Furthermore, MAD was a potent inhibitor of DDS N-hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes (52% inhibition at 0.01 mM MAD) compared with human liver microsomes (23% inhibition at 0.4 mM MAD). Human, but not rat, liver microsomes deacetylated MAD to DDS by an NADPH independent mechanism. These results show that substantial differences exist in DDS N-hydroxylase between rats and humans, with respect to substrate affinity, enzyme activity, and susceptibility to inhibition, such that information obtained from the rat should not be extrapolated to humans. We conclude that MAD is a potent inhibitor of DDS-NOH formation in rat liver microsomes. The degree of inhibition in human microsomes, however, suggest that MAD is unlikely to be a significant modulator of enzyme activity in vivo.",M1

N-hydroxylation is thought to be an essential step in the haemotoxicity of dapsone (<e>DDS</e>). To investigate both metabolism-dependent and cell-selective drug toxicity in vitro we have developed a three-compartment system in which an hepatic drug metabolizing system is contained within a central compartment separated by semipermeable membranes from compartments containing mononuclear leucocytes (MNL) and red blood cells (RBC). 2. Metabolism of dapsone (100 microM) by rat liver microsomes resulted in toxicity to RBC cells (47.3 +/- 2.1% methaemoglobin), but there was no significant toxicity toward MNL (3.7 +/- 1.3% cell death) compared with control values (1.6 +/- 0.9%). However, when RBC were replaced with buffer in the third compartment there was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.001) white cell toxicity (17.6 +/- 0.6% cell death), demonstrating the protection of MNL by RBC. Metabolism of dapsone by human liver microsomes again resulted in RBC toxicity (12.5 +/- 3.3% methaemoglobin) but no significant MNL toxicity (2.9 +/- 0.8% cell death). Replacement of RBC resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in MNL toxicity (6.5 +/- 0.7% cell death). Addition of synthetic dapsone hydroxylamine (30 microM) in the absence of a metabolizing system and with no RBC in the third compartment resulted in significant (P &lt; 0.001) toxicity toward MNL (43.36 +/- 5.82% cell death) compared with control (1.8 +/- 1.1%). The presence of RBC in the third compartment resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.001) decrease in MNL toxicity (17.6 +/- 2.2% cell death), with 40.1 +/- 3.7% methaemoglobin in the RBC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

On skin-smear examination 50 patients were found positive, of which 9 showed a BI of 3+ or higher at any site. With regard to the clinical status the only cases found with clinical signs of relapse were 5 out of 7 long-standing patients with BI of 4+ and 5+.

The results showed that in 1 case the Mycobacterium leprae were resistant to both drugs; the organisms from 2 other patients were susceptible to RMP but low-grade resistant to DDS. Those from another patient were susceptible to RMP and fully resistant to DDS. In 3 other cases the bacilli did not multiply in any of the mice but 1 of these strains was from the patient taking a second RMP course, therefore this strain might also be susceptible to RMP and resistant to DDS. In the last 2 cases multiplication was only observed in 2 of the controls and in 1 of the 0.0001% DDS treated mice; therefore, these experiments were not conclusive, and the AFB recovered were inoculated into fresh mice to repeat the tests but these failed to multiply.",M1
8444513,"Acetylation of dapsone by human whole blood.We studied the acetylation of dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) in vitro by whole blood taken from subjects with known acetylator phenotype. The acetylation of DDS by whole blood was both incubation time- and DDS concentration-dependent. Thus, it is highly recommended to separate plasma immediately after blood withdrawal during acetylation phenotyping using DDS. para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) substantially inhibited the acetylation of DDS by whole blood taken from both slow and rapid acetylators, while procainamide (PAD) significantly inhibited DDS acetylation by whole blood taken from slow acetylators. At the highest PAD concentration used (208 microM), DDS acetylation by whole blood taken from rapid acetylators was also inhibited. In contrast, sulphanilamide (SAD) failed to produce any significant inhibition of the acetylation of DDS by whole blood taken from either slow or rapid acetylators. Furthermore, there was no correlation between DDS acetylation by whole blood in vitro and the acetylator status of the subject. It is therefore not possible to predict the acetylator phenotype by studying DDS acetylation by human whole blood. These results indicate that the DDS N-acetyltransferase of human whole blood is most probably of the monomorphic type.",M1
1471153,"Dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia: effect of N-hydroxy dapsone on the sulfhydryl status and membrane proteins of rat erythrocytes.Dapsone hydroxylamine (<e>DDS</e>-NOH), a known metabolite of dapsone, has recently been shown to be a direct-acting hemotoxin responsible in part for dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in the rat. The effect of DDS-NOH on the morphology, sulfhydryl status, and membrane skeletal proteins of the rat red cell has been investigated. Exposure of rat red cells to a TC50 of DDS-NOH induced transformation of about 50% of the cells to an extreme echinocyte morphology. Reduced glutathione content of the cells was rapidly lost with concomitant increase in the formation of mixed disulfide between glutathione and the soluble protein of the cell. Oxidized glutathione content of the cells did not increase at any time during exposure to DDS-NOH. Examination of the skeletal membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE indicated that DDS-NOH caused the apparent loss of band 4.2, decrease in peaks 1, 2.1, and 3, and the appearance of new bands at about 16, 27, 40, and 54 kDa. Bands 4.1 and 7 appeared unchanged. Treatment of DDS-NOH altered proteins with dithiothreitol, reversed the protein changes, and indicated that the observed alterations were due to the formation of disulfide-linked adducts between hemoglobin and the various skeletal proteins as well as between hemoglobin monomers. The possible significance of the parallel changes in cell morphology and in membrane skeletal proteins for the premature splenic sequestration of the injured rat red cells is discussed.",M1

Isoprodian Study Group.In order to assess the potential additive liver toxicity of isoniazid to that of a thioamide-containing treatment, a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 24 weeks' duration involving 772 adult patients was conducted in four leprosy centers--two in India, one in Madagascar, and one in the Ivory Coast. Patients with multibacillary leprosy were given daily 100 mg dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) and 350 mg prothionamide (PTH) plus monthly 600 mg rifampin (RMP) in combination either with 350 mg isoniazid (INH) or with a placebo. After clinical and laboratory (including HBs-Ag testing) examinations on admission, the side effects (especially gastrointestinal disturbances and liver toxicity) were assessed at regular intervals during treatment by laboratory testing (aminotransferases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and by recording spontaneous complaints. Analysis of the frequency and seriousness of the side effects was made before breaking the code (with or without INH). Although 10% of the patients had liver toxicity leading to stopping treatment, no significant difference in the occurrence of side effects was observed between patients treated with or without INH. Most (75%) of the observed side effects occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and the time of their onset was not related to INH. Body weight and age were factors related to the frequency of side effects [the higher the body weight, the lesser the rate of side effects (p = 0.03)] and the rate of serious side effects increased with age (p = 0.02). But, again, the frequency of the side effects was not related to INH administration. Therefore, from the present study it can be concluded that INH does not increase the toxicity of the thioamide-containing treatment.",M1

The dapsone or sulphone syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) has been recognized since the earliest days of sulphone therapy but until recently its incidence had been decreasing. In Vanuatu, during the years 1988-1991, nine leprosy patients have developed the dapsone syndrome, four of whom have died. During the last 4 years only 37 patients were started on treatment, which is an incidence of the dapsone syndrome of 24% with a fatality rate of 11%. All the patients were being given multi-drug treatment (MDT) of daily dapsone (100 mg) and clofazimine (50 mg) and monthly rifampicin (600 mg) and clofazimine (300 mg). There has been speculation that the increased incidence of what was previously described as a rare reaction is due to the use of MDT, and the reasons for this are discussed. We feel the increase in the number of reactions in Vanuatu since starting MDT is probably due to the high starting dose of 100 mg of dapsone, possibly enhanced by the combination with clofazimine and rifampicin and a genetic susceptibility of the Melanesian population.",M1

Treatment was stopped at the end of six months. The patients tolerated the drugs fairly well and in only two patients the drugs had to be stopped (in one due to jaundice and in the other due to gastric intolerance). About 6% of patients had early reactions which subsided with additional steroid therapy. The inactivity rate was 60% at six months and this improved to 96% at 12 months. No cases of late reactions and relapses were encountered in the limited follow-up period of six months; and a longer follow-up is necessary for ascertaining the relapse rates. The preliminary results however suggest that the addition of prothionamide to the standard WHO paucibacillary regimen is well-tolerated with increased inactivity rate and fewer instances of late reactions.",M1

The chemical environments of the two acyl chains of DPPC are inequivalent and the inequivalence decreases with increasing DPPC concentration. At low concentrations of DPPC (less than 1.0 mM) intramolecular interactions predominate, whereas at high concentrations, intermolecular interactions predominate. Addition of water to this system, at high concentrations of the phospholipid, reduces the intermolecular interactions. In the presence of the antileprotic drug, Diamino Diphenyl Sulfone (<e>DDS</e> or Dapsone), significant shifts were observed only in the choline resonances of DPPC and the amino resonance of the drug, showing that the amino group of DDS interacts with the head group of DPPC.",M1

Single doses of the drug in rats (6.25-12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) suppressed the kindled seizures in a dose-dependent manner without overt behavioral toxicity. With repeated oral administration in cats, relatively higher initial doses (13-23 mg/kg) were required to obtain seizure suppression, and neurotoxic signs occurred within a few days with serum drug levels of approximately 20 micrograms/ml. Although dapsone showed anticonvulsive effects in both animal species, the effective serum levels overlapped the toxic levels reported in the clinical treatment of leprosy. In the majority of the cats, however, seizure suppression was maintained even after the discontinuation of dapsone with lower serum levels than those observed at the beginning of the seizure suppression. Therefore, dapsone would be useful as an antiepileptic drug only when long-term anticonvulsive efficacy is demonstrated using smaller doses comparable to those used in the treatment of leprosy.",M1

In-vitro in the rat, the pattern of toxicity was slightly different:DADDT was not haemotoxic, whilst 3,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulphone (3,4'DDS) and 3,3'-diaminodiphenyl sulphone (3,3'DDS) as well as DDS, MADDS and MADDT were significantly greater than control. 4,4' Acetyl diphenyl sulphone (DADDS), 4,4' diaminodiphenyl thioether (DDT), 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether (DDE) and 4,4' diaminooctofluorodiphenyl sulphone (F8DDS) did not cause significant methaemoglobinaemia in either human or rat liver microsomes. DDS, MADDS, and MADDT were not significantly different in haemotoxicity generation in-vitro in the presence of human microsomes. In the rat in-vitro, DDS, MADDS, and 3,4'DDS did not differ significantly in red cell toxicity, and were the most potent methaemoglobin formers.

The frequency of slow acetylators determined using the plasma monoacetyldapsone (MADDS) to DDS ratio (MADDS/DDS), was 67.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 59 to 76%. Slow acetylators had an acetylation ratio of less than 0.42. 3. Applying the Hardy-Weinberg Law, the frequency of the recessive allele controlling slow acetylation was found to be 0.82 +/- 0.02. 4. The frequency distribution histogram of the plasma MADDS/DDS ratio showed an apparent trimodal pattern. The number of homozygous (n = 16) and heterozygous (n = 36) rapid acetylators derived from the observed data did not agree with those predicted for the respective rapid acetylators (n = 5 and n = 47) according to the Hardy-Weinberg Law. The suggested antimode used to discriminate the two groups was 0.82. 5. The mean plasma concentration of MADDS and the mean plasma acetylation ratio were about three times lower in slow than in rapid acetylators. However, there was no difference in mean plasma DDS concentration between slow and rapid acetylators. 6. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.853, P less than 0.001) between plasma MADDS concentration and the acetylation ratio. For DDS such a correlation was absent (r = 0.059, P = 0.23).",M1

2071980,"Fixed duration MDT in paucibacillary leprosy.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a fixed duration of multidrug therapy (MDT) for paucibacillary leprosy which is currently widely implemented in India. A clinico-pathological study was initiated in 1984 to assess the efficacy of this regimen. The clinical and histological responses of the patients to MDT were assessed at the end of 6 months, when their treatment was stopped, and at 2 1/2 years, when they were released from surveillance, and compared with the responses of a matched patient group to conventional dapsone (<e>DDS</e>) monotherapy during the same period. Of 28 patients who completed the MDT schedule, there was less than 60% improvement in 33% of them when treatment was stopped at the end of 6 months and in 20% of them at the end of 2 1/2 years. Of 26 patients receiving DDS monotherapy, 37% showed less than 60% improvement at the end of 6 months but only 8.8% had less than 60% improvement at 2 1/2 years. It is concluded that MDT for paucibacillary leprosy as recommended by WHO may not have a major advantage over DDS monotherapy, since about 20% of those patients on MDT continue to have evidence of active disease when discharged from surveillance.",M1

After the addition of DDS alone to the liver there was a monoexponential decline of parent drug concentrations and rapid formation of DDS-NOH (within 10 min) which coincided with methaemoglobin formation (11.7 +/- 3.0%, mean +/- s.d.) which reached a maximum (22.6 +/- 9.2%) at 1 h. The appearance of monoacetyl DDS (MADDS) was not apparent until 30-45 min. Addition of cimetidine resulted in major changes in the pharmacokinetics of DDS and its metabolites. The AUC of DDS in the presence of cimetidine (1018.8 +/- 267.8 micrograms min mL-1) was almost three-fold higher than control (345.0 +/- 68.1 micrograms min mL-1, P less than 0.01). The half-life of DDS was also prolonged by cimetidine compared with control (117.0 +/- 48.2 min vs 51.2 +/- 22.9, P less than 0.05). The clearance of DDS (3.0 +/- 0.55 mL min-1) was greatly reduced in the presence of cimetidine (1.03 +/- 0.26 mL min-1 P less than 0.01). The AUC0-3h for DDS-NOH (28.3 +/- 21.2 micrograms min mL-1) was significantly reduced by cimetidine (8.1 +/- 3.40 micrograms min mL-1, P less than 0.01). In contrast, there was a marked increase in the AUC0-3h for MADDS (32.7 +/- 25.8 micrograms min mL-1) in the presence of cimetidine (166.0 +/- 26.5 micrograms min mL-1 P less than 0.01). The methaemoglobinaemia associated with DDS was reduced to below 5% by cimetidine. Hence, a shift in hepatic metabolism from bioactivation (N-hydroxylation) to detoxication (N-acetylation) caused by cimetidine, was associated with a fall in methaemoglobinaemia. These data suggest that the combination of DDS with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor might reduce the risk to benefit ratio of DDS.",M1

18076855,"Case report: Denys- Drash syndrome.BACKGROUND: Denys-Drash Syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) is an uncommon disorder that appears sporadically and in rare cases may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait It manifests either at birth or within the first year of life and typically consists of the triad of congenital nephropathy, Wilms tumour and intersex disorder. CASE REPORT: A 10 year-old Caucasian girl was referred to the Dental Department, at Glasgow Royal Hospital for Sick Children by her Paediatric Nephrologist Consultant. The patient was being teased by her peers over her markedly discoloured teeth. The dental history revealed that the patient was a regular dental attendee from an early age. She was dentally anxious having only experienced dental treatment under general anaesthesia (GA) when she was 4 years old. Apparently her primary dentition also showed a generalised discolouration. TREATMENT: This consisted of multiple visits for diet analysis and tooth brushing instruction with the use of disclosing tablets. Plaque control significantly improved when using a battery operated toothbrush because of its larger handle which the patient found easier to use and a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthwash was given for daily use. Dyract(AP) veneers directly bonded onto maxillary permanent incisors and mandibular permanent anterior teeth was carried out. This was an interim measure to improve the patient's appearance while assessing the patient co-operation. The compomer facings were replaced with BelleGlass NG veneers which were cemented onto the maxillary incisors and mandibular anterior teeth using Adhesive By Choice (ABC) system under rubber dam on two separate visits. FOLLOW-UP: At her last visit, 27 months after treatment, the patient was still satisfied with the restorative treatment. However, further teeth had erupted including all the premolars.

18040647,"Effects on kidney disease, fertility and development in mice inheriting a protein-truncating Denys-Drash syndrome allele (Wt1tmT396).Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) is caused by heterozygous mutations of the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1, characterised by early-onset diffuse mesangial sclerosis often associated with male pseudohermaphroditism and/or Wilms' tumourigenesis. Previously, we reported that the Wt1tmT396 allele induces DDS kidney disease in mice. In the present study heterozygotes (Wt1tmT396/+) were generated on inbred (129/Ola), crossbred (B6/129) and MF1 second backcross (MF1-N2) backgrounds. Whereas male heterozygotes on each background were fertile, inbred heterozygous females were infertile. Kidney disease (proteinuria and sclerosis) was not congenital and developed significantly earlier in inbred mice, although with variable onset. Disease onset in MF1-N2 stocks occurred later in Wt1tmT396/+ mice than reported previously for Wt1R394W/+ mice, and while no kidney disease has been reported in B6/129 Wt1+/- mice, B6/129 Wt1tmT396/+ mice were affected. Offspring of both male and female B6/129 and MF1-N2 Wt1tmT396/+ mice developed kidney disease, but its incidence was significantly higher in offspring of female heterozygotes. Wt1tmT396/tmT396 embryos exhibited identical developmental abnormalities to those reported for Wt1-/- embryos. The results indicate that the Wt1 (tmT396) allele does not predispose to Wilms' tumourigenesis or male pseudohermaphroditism, its effect on kidney disease and female fertility depends on genetic background, stochastic factors may affect disease onset, and disease transmission is subject to a partial parent-of-origin effect. Since the Wt1tmT396 allele has no detectable intrinsic functional activity in vivo, and kidney disease progression is affected by the type of Wt1 mutation, the data support the view that DDS nephropathy results from a dominant-negative action rather than WT1 haploinsufficiency or gain-of-function.",M2
17533022,"Small glomeruli in WAGR (Wilms Tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary Anomalies and Mental Retardation) syndrome.BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation (WAGR) syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of band 11p13, which results in the loss of 1 allele of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1). It is not classically associated with nephropathies, but increased rates of renal failure are reported. Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>), caused by mutations in the WT1 gene affecting the third or second zinc finger, is characterized by a triad of glomerulopathy progressing rapidly to end-stage renal disease, male hermaphroditism, and Wilms tumor.

17487399,"VEGF transcription and mRNA stability are altered by WT1 not <e>DDS</e>(R384W) expression in LNCaP cells.To identify physiologically relevant WT1 transcriptional target genes in prostate cancer cells, we have established stably transfected LNCaP cell lines expressing either WT1(A), its mutant counterpart DDS(R384W), or vector control. Microarray analyses of these cells revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was differentially expressed in the engineered lines. Regulation of VEGF by WT1 likely contributes to kidney angiogenesis during development and WT1 mutants such as DDS(R384W) are associated with the Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), characterized by renal abnormalities. Recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the WT1(A) isoform binds VEGF promoter sequences and transcriptionally regulates VEGF reporter constructs. However, regulation of VEGF is complex, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. This study examined the ability of hormone and Actinomycin D treatment to alter VEGF mRNA levels in stably transfected WT-LNCaP, DDS-LNCaP, or V-LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The rationale of this study was based on a previous finding that enhancement of VEGF expression in DDS-LNCaP cells occurred only in the presence of the androgen analog, R1881. One possible explanation for these results was that DDS-WT1 stabilized VEGF mRNA so that it accumulated to higher levels. This hypothesis was tested by treating engineered LNCaP cells with Actinomycin D (Act D) and then measuring VEGF mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR. The combined effects of WT1 or DDS(R384W) and hormone were tested in these message stability assays and also in transcription assays of transiently transfected LNCaP cells. The results indicated that DDS-WT1 is unable to regulate VEGF transcription or stabilize VEGF mRNA in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. However our observations are also consistent with wild-type WT1(A) having both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on VEGF mRNA levels in the presence of hormone. These studies of VEGF regulation by WT1 and dysregulation by DDS(R384W) suggest an important role for WT1 in both normal and tumor-related angiogenesis.",M2
17295355,"A proteomic investigation of glomerular podocytes from a Denys-Drash syndrome patient with a mutation in the Wilms tumour suppressor gene WT1.Glomerular podocytes are essential for blood filtration in the kidney underpinned by their unique cytoskeletal morphology. An increasing number of kidney diseases are being associated with key podocyte abnormalities. The Wilms tumour suppressor gene (WT1) encodes a zinc finger protein with a crucial role in normal kidney development; and in the adult, WT1 is required for normal podocyte function. Denys-Drash Syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) results from mutations affecting the zinc finger domain of WT1. The aim of this study was to undertake, for the first time, a proteomic analysis of cultured human podocytes; and to analyse the molecular changes in DDS podocytes. The morphology of DDS podocytes was highly irregular, reminiscent of a fibroblastic appearance. A reference 2-D gel was generated, and 75 proteins were identified of which 43% involved in cytoskeletal architecture. The DDS and wild-type proteomes were compared by 2-D DIGE. The level of 95.6% of proteins was unaltered; but 4.4% were altered more than two-fold. A sample of proteins involved in cytoskeletal architecture appeared to be misexpressed in DDS podocytes. Consistent with this finding, overall levels of filamentous actin also appeared reduced in DDS podocytes. We conclude that one of WT1 functions in podocytes is to regulate the expression of key components and regulators of the cytoskeleton.",M2
17267748,"Impaired glomerular maturation and lack of VEGF165b in Denys-Drash syndrome.Individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) develop diffuse mesangial sclerosis, ultimately leading to renal failure. The disease is caused by mutations that affect the zinc finger structure of the Wilms' tumor protein (WT1), but the mechanisms whereby these mutations result in glomerulosclerosis remain largely obscure. How WT1 regulates genes is likely to be complex, because it has multiple splice forms, binds both DNA and RNA, and associates with spliceosomes. Herein is described that in DDS podocytes, the ratio of both WT1 +KTS isoforms C to D differs considerably from that of normal child and adult control podocytes and more closely resembles fetal profiles. Aside from the delay in podocyte maturation, DDS glomeruli show swollen endothelial cells, reminiscent of endotheliosis, together with incompletely fused capillary basement membranes; a dramatic decrease in collagen alpha4(IV) and laminin beta2 chains; and the presence of immature or activated mesangial cells that express alpha-smooth muscle actin. Because appropriate vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression is known to be essential for the development and maintenance of glomerular architecture and function, this article addresses the question of whether VEGF-A expression is deregulated in DDS. The data presented here show that DDS podocytes express high levels of the proangiogenic isoform VEGF165, but completely lack the inhibitory isoform VEGF165b. The VEGF165/VEGF165b ratio in DDS resembles that of fetal S-shaped bodies, rather than that of normal child or adult control subjects. The alteration in VEGF-A expression presented here may provide a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of DDS.",M2
17061122,"WT1 intron 9 splice acceptor site mutation in a 46,XY male with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) plays crucial roles in urogenital and gonadal development. Germline mutations of WT1 have been reported in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) and Frasier syndrome (FS). Based on clinical overlaps reported to date, it has been suggested that these two syndromes should be considered as part of a spectrum of diseases caused by WT1 gene mutations, rather than as separate diseases. We report a new mutation in an intron 9 splice acceptor site (IVS -1G--&gt;) in a Japanese 46,XY male patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and bilateral cryptorchism. The clinical phenotype of this patient resembled FS without male pseudohermaphroditism. Interestingly, although the patient's right kidney was diagnosed with FSGS, his left kidney showed severe hypoplasia. There are no previous case reports of FSGS and renal hypoplasia in the same individual with a WT1 mutation. The findings for this case further suggest that the renal phenotype has various manifestations and is not always decided by the type of WT1 mutation. The possibility that the position of the WT1 mutation may influence the course of the nephropathy should be evaluated in a larger patient cohort.",M2

METHODS: Five patients with CNS and four patients with DDS, which causes secondary CNS, were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Seven patients were sporadic and two DDS patients were identical twins. Five CNS patients presented with edema within 3 months of birth. In four DDS patients, edema was not noted and end-stage renal disease developed between 7 months and 6 years of age. Of these five CNS patients, one patient had cerebral thrombosis and cytomegalovirus pneumonia at the onset and another patient died during dialysis. Frequent intravenous albumin administration required, growth and development during infancy were varied. Of the nine patients with CNS and DDS, seven received renal transplantation and were alive with functioning grafts at the last follow up. Catch-up growth was observed in five patients after transplantation. Five school-aged patients attended school and received adequate grades and two adults worked full-time. Of the DDS patients, dysuria due to hypospadias persisted in one patient and treatment for hypogonadism was needed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: CNS and DDS were diagnosed early after onset and adequate treatment was started. Growth and development after renal transplantation were relatively good. Thrombotic episodes or severe infection in CNS patients was difficult to manage and complications resulting from DDS affected the quality of life.",M2
16245160,"Gonadal effects of a mouse Denys-Drash syndrome mutation.Gonadal effects of the Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) mutation Wt1(tmT396 )were examined in chimaeric and heterozygous mice. Since the only heterozygote was 41,XXY, Sertoli cell function was assessed by comparison with age-matched control XXY testes. Control XXY Sertoli cells showed immuno-expression of WT1 and androgen receptor (AR) indistinguishable from wild-type (40,XY), but expressed anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). In contrast, DDS Sertoli cells showed only faint immuno-expression of WT1 and did not express AR or AMH. While XY&lt;--&gt;XY DDS chimaeras were male, XX&lt;--&gt;XY chimaeras were predominantly female. In the rare XX&lt;--&gt;XY DDS males the Sertoli cell lineage was largely derived from Wt1 mutant XY cells. We conclude that DDS mutant cells can form Sertoli cells, that the dominant mutation does not cause male sex reversal in mice but distorts the sex ratio of XX&lt;--&gt;XY chimaeras, and that there may be a link between WT1, AMH and AR expression by Sertoli cells in vivo.",M2
15509792,"The Wt1+/R394W mouse displays glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure characteristic of human Denys-Drash syndrome.Renal failure is a frequent and costly complication of many chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. One common feature of renal failure is glomerulosclerosis, the pathobiology of which is unclear. To help elucidate this, we generated a mouse strain carrying the missense mutation Wt1 R394W, which predisposes humans to glomerulosclerosis and early-onset renal failure (Denys-Drash syndrome [<e>DDS</e>]). Kidney development was normal in Wt1(+/R394W) heterozygotes. However, by 4 months of age 100% of male heterozygotes displayed proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis characteristic of DDS patients. This phenotype was observed in an MF1 background but not in a mixed B6/129 background, suggestive of the action of a strain-specific modifying gene(s). WT1 encodes a nuclear transcription factor, and the R394W mutation is known to impair this function. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of Wt1 R394W-induced renal failure, the expression of genes whose deletion leads to glomerulosclerosis (NPHS1, NPHS2, and CD2AP) was quantitated. In mutant kidneys, NPHS1 and NPHS2 were only moderately downregulated (25 to 30%) at birth but not at 2 or 4 months. Expression of CD2AP was not changed at birth but was significantly upregulated at 2 and 4 months. Podocalyxin was downregulated by 20% in newborn kidneys but not in kidneys at later ages. Two other genes implicated in glomerulosclerosis, TGFB1 and IGF1, were upregulated at 2 months and at 2 and 4 months, respectively. It is not clear whether the significant alterations in gene expression are a cause or a consequence of the disease process. However, the data do suggest that Wt1 R394W-induced glomerulosclerosis may be independent of downregulation of the genes for NPHS1, NPHS2, CD2AP, and podocalyxin and may involve other genes yet to be implicated in renal failure. The Wt1(R394W) mouse recapitulates the pathology and disease progression observed in patients carrying the same mutation, and the mutation is completely penetrant in male animals. Thus, it will be a powerful and biologically relevant model for investigating the pathobiology of the earliest events in glomerulosclerosis.",M2

DDS is associated with constitutional WT1 mutations, the majority being missense mutations in the zinc-finger region. A dominant-negative mode of action of the mutant DDS proteins is thought to explain the more severe genitourinary phenotype seen in DDS compared with children with complete deletion of one WT1 allele. We present a phenotypically female child who presented with bilateral Wilms tumor at 8 months of age. She was found to have an XY karyotype and diagnosed with DDS. In the constitutional DNA of this child we found a previously unreported mutation in exon 1 of WT1. This de novo mutation, delT in codon 40, is predicted to produce a termination signal in codon 90 (F40fsX90). This frameshift mutation results in a severely truncated protein, which would remove both the zinc-finger DNA-binding domain and the majority of the N-terminal regulatory domain, including regions previously shown in vitro to be necessary for inhibition of WT1 transcriptional activity. Our results provide important physiological evidence that the first 40 amino acids of WT1 are capable of functionally important interactions, presumably through their ability to self-associate with full-length WT1.",M2
15232745,"The dysregulated glomerular cell growth in Denys-Drash syndrome.While diffuse mesangial sclerosis is traditionally described as being the glomerulopathy of Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>), the podocyte proliferative lesions may be overlooked in these DDS cases. In the present study, an evolving process is extrapolated from a selected case of DDS that demonstrated glomerulopathy with conspicuous podocyte proliferation. The observation that podocytes express proliferation markers (Ki67, proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and topoisomerase IIalpha) in non-proliferative, mature-looking glomeruli suggests an initial pathogenic act to activate or to keep podocytes from quiescence. The subsequent proliferation of podocytes is in keeping with downregulation of WT1 and cyclin kinase inhibitors of p16 and p21. The emergence of cytokeratin-positive cells in glomeruli that show typical mesangial sclerosis implies elimination of podocytes and replacement with tubular and/or parietal epithelial cells. The final scene of evolving glomerulopathy displays apoptosis and expression of Fas-L and Bax in sclerotic mesangial lesions, which eventually end up with global sclerosis. This novel concept of DDS glomerulopathy implies complex molecular mechanisms involved in glomerular injury.",M2
14671061,"Prophylactic bilateral nephrectomies in two paediatric patients with missense mutations in the WT1 gene.BACKGROUND: Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) is associated with mutations of the Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) gene, and is characterized by pseudohermaphroditism, a progressive glomerulopathy, and the development of Wilms' tumour. More than 90% of patients with DDS who carry constitutional intragenic WT1 mutations are at high risk (90%) for the development of Wilms' tumour. WT1 is a signalling protein with 90% of WT1 mutations occurring in the WT1 zinc finger region as single nucleotide polymorphisms, the majority of which are missense mutations. METHODS: Constitutional DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Direct sequencing and restriction enzymes were employed to analyse mutations. RESULTS: Two children, 46XY males who had evidence of pseudohermaphroditism, hypogonadism and renal failure with a glomerulopathy atypical for DDS, but no Wilms' tumour or nephroblastomatosis, on investigation, prior to transplant, were identified with missense mutations in the WT1 gene, in exons 8 and 9, respectively. The decision to do prophylactic nephrectomies was based on the genetic identification of WT1 mutations supporting a diagnosis of incomplete DDS, with the potential for increased risk of malignancy with the development of Wilms' tumour. The nephrectomy specimens demonstrated nephrogenic rests (nephroblastomatosis), which have a potential for malignant transformation. CONCLUSIONS: WT1 missense mutations in exons 8 and 9 can be regarded as having the potential for malignant change supporting prophylactic nephrectomy in apparent incomplete DDS patients with end-stage renal disease.",M2
12970737,"Transcriptional activity of testis-determining factor SRY is modulated by the Wilms' tumor 1 gene product, WT1.The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) and sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY) genes are essential for development of the mammalian gonads and mutations in these genes are associated with gonadal dysgenesis in humans. The SRY gene encodes a transcription factor with one high-mobility group (HMG) box as a DNA-binding domain. WT1 encodes a transcription factor that contains four contiguous C2H2-type zinc-finger motifs as a DNA/RNA binding or protein-protein interaction domain. Here we report that WT1 binds to and acts synergistically with SRY to activate transcription from a promoter containing SRY-binding sites. This interaction is mediated by the WT1 zinc-finger domain and the SRY HMG box. WT1 mutants associated with Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>), which is characterized by Wilms' tumor, pseudohermaphroditism, and nephropathy, fail to interact with SRY. Wildtype WT1 is recruited to SRY-binding sites in an SRY-dependent manner, whereas DDS mutants are not recruited as efficiently. These results suggest that WT1 forms a complex with SRY to regulate transcription and that this WT1-SRY interaction is important in testis development.",M2

In her childhood, she suffered from renal failure requesting kidney transplantation at the age of 11. The investigations for primary amenorrhea revealed a hypergonadotropic hypogonadism associated with 46 XY karyotype. The association of primary amenorrhea with renal failure suggested Frasier syndrome (FS) or Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>).

12915483,"Murine Denys-Drash syndrome: evidence of podocyte de-differentiation and systemic mediation of glomerulosclerosis.Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) is caused by dominant mutations of the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1, and characterized by a nephropathy involving diffuse mesangial sclerosis, male pseudohermaphroditism and/or Wilms' tumourigenesis. Previously, we reported that heterozygosity for the Wt1tmT396 mutation induces DDS in heterozygous and chimeric (Wt1tmT396/+&lt;--&gt;+/+) mice. In the present study, the fate of Wt1 mutant cells in chimeric kidneys was assessed by in situ marker analysis, and immunocytochemistry was used to re-examine the claim that glomerulosclerosis (GS) is caused by loss of WT1 and persistent Pax-2 expression by podocytes. Wt1 mutant cells colonized glomeruli efficiently, including podocytes, but some sclerotic glomeruli contained no detectable Wt1 mutant cells. The development of GS was preceded by widespread loss of ZO-1 signal in podocytes (even in kidneys where &lt;5% of glomeruli contained Wt1 mutant podocytes), increased intra-renal renin expression, and de novo podocyte TGF-beta1 expression, but not podocyte Pax-2 expression or loss of WT1, synaptopodin, alpha-actinin-4 or nephrin expression. However, podocytes in partially sclerotic glomeruli that still expressed WT1 at high levels showed reduced vimentin expression, cell cycle re-entry, and re-expressed desmin, cytokeratin and Pax-2. The results suggest that: (i) GS is not due to loss of WT1 expression by podocytes; (ii) podocyte Pax-2 expression reflects re-expression rather than persistent expression, and is the consequence of GS; (iii) GS is mediated systemically and the mechanism involves activation of the renin-angiotensin system; and (iv) podocytes undergo typical maturational changes but subsequently de-differentiate and revert to an immature phenotype during disease progression.",M2
12488983,"Embryonal hyperplasia of Bowman's capsular epithelium in patients with WT1 mutations.Embryonal hyperplasia of Bowman's capsular epithelium (EHBCE) is a rare condition, observed in patients with end-stage renal disease when treated with long-term dialysis. Immunohistochemical studies have suggested that EHBCE originates from the visceral epithelium of the Bowman's capsule. Here we report two patients with WT1 missense mutations in exon 7, who received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and developed EHBCE without Wilms tumor. One patient showed manifestations of Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>), while the other patient exhibited rapid progress into end-stage renal disease, but no genitourinary anomaly. Recently, abnormal expression of WT1 and PAX2 was shown in the podocytes in diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) associated with DDS and isolated DMS. We hypothesize that EHBCE is a reversion of Bowman's capsular epithelial cells to an earlier cell differentiation state, which has the characteristics of a progenitor cell of both Bowman's capsular epithelia and podocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of WT1, PAX2, vimentin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen was performed in the kidney specimens obtained at autopsy or surgery. Abnormal expression of WT1 and PAX2 in the EHBCE was observed in both patients, supporting our hypothesis. The nephropathy associated with constitutional WT1 mutations might therefore be associated with EHBCE.",M2
11933209,"A review of the phenotypic variation due to the Denys-Drash syndrome-associated germline WT1 mutation R362X.The gene WT1 is required for the normal development and function of the urogenital tract. Constitutional mutations are associated with familial Wilms tumor and syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome (<e>DDS</e>) characterized by nephropathy, genital anomalies and often a predisposition to Wilms tumor. We report a case of constitutional WT1 mutation in an XX female with multifocal Wilms tumor but no genital anomalies or renal dysfunction and, for the first time, review patients previously reported with this germline mutation. The mutation (1084C&gt;T) changes the amino acid arginine at position 362 to the translation stop codon TGA (R362X) resulting in a predicted truncated protein lacking three of the four zinc finger domains necessary for correct functioning of the gene. This constitutional mutation has been reported to cause a variety of phenotypes in eleven different patients, including the classical Denys-Drash phenotype of diffuse mesangial sclerosis which leads to early renal failure, genital anomalies in XY individuals and Wilms tumors. The absence of mesangial sclerosis and renal failure in our patient excludes DDS. Our case differs from those previously described as the normal kidney tissue shows some small subcapsular glomeruli indicating that the WT1 mutation has impaired nephron development. This patient extends the range and variation of phenotypes that may arise from a specific germline mutation in WT1.",M2

20372002,"[Development of novel cell culture systems utilizing the advantages of collagen vitrigel membrane]The white of an egg, rendered opaque by boiling, can be converted into a thin, transparent and rigid material like glass by evaporating the moisture. This phenomenon is known as the vitrification of heat-denatured proteins. We applied vitrification technology to a collagen gel and converted it into a rigid glass-like material. We attempted to rehydrate the glass-like material and succeeded in preparing a novel stable state of collagen gel that was a thin and transparent membrane with excellent gel strength and protein permeability. We called it  collagen vitrigel  because it was produced from the vitrification process of a traditional hydrogel. Further, a framework-embedded collagen vitrigel membrane that can be easily turned inside out with tweezers was prepared by inserting a nylon membrane ring in the collagen sol prior to the gelation, thereby allowing the membrane to function as a removable cell culture substratum. Different types of anchorage-dependent cells could be cultured on both surfaces of the substratum by the manipulation of two-dimensional cultures, and consequently a three-dimensional crosstalk model with paracrine effects from each cell type was reconstructed. Also, the collagen vitrigel membrane containing a bioactive molecule provided a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) with sustainable release. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of applied studies using the collagen vitrigel membrane as follows: a corneal model for eye irritant and permeability tests, a skin model for sensitization test, a renal glomerular model for evaluating blood filtration, an endometrial model for developing a new treatment and a DDS of hepatocyte growth factor for improving liver disorder.",M3
20212197,"Randomized controlled trial of an intravitreous dexamethasone drug delivery system in patients with diabetic macular edema.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a dexamethasone intravitreous drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME). METHODS: Patients with persistent macular edema (&gt; or = 90 days' duration) were randomized to treatment with 700 microg or 350 microg of dexamethasone DDS or observation. One eye from each patient was designated as the study eye. The analysis is of the eyes in this study with DME (n = 171). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of eyes that achieved an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 10 letters or more from baseline at day 90. Other outcome measures included fluorescein leakage, central retinal thickness, and safety parameters. RESULTS: At day 90, a BCVA improvement of 10 letters or more was seen in more eyes in the 700-microg group (33.3%) and 350-microg group (21.1%) than the observation group (12.3%; P = .007 vs 700-microg group). At day 180, a BCVA improvement of 10 letters or more was seen in 30% of eyes in the 700-microg group, 19% in the 350-microg group, and 23% in the observation group (P &gt; or = .4 for treated vs observed eyes). There were also significantly greater improvements in central retinal thickness and fluorescein leakage in treated eyes than observed eyes (P = .03; day 90). Dexamethasone DDS was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with persistent DME, treatment with 700 microg of intravitreal dexamethasone DDS is well tolerated and produces significant improvements in BCVA, central retinal thickness, and fluorescein leakage compared with observation (statistically significant at day 90). APPLICATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Dexamethasone DDS, 700 microg, may have potential as a treatment for persistent DME. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00035906.",M3
20053444,"Peptide-conjugated biodegradable nanoparticles as a carrier to target paclitaxel to tumor neovasculature.Antiangiogenic cancer therapy can be achieved through the targeted delivery of antiangiogenic agents to the endothelial cells of tumor neovasculature. In the present study, we developed a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>), nanoparticles conjugated with K237-(HTMYYHHYQHHL) peptides for tumor neovasculature targeting drug delivery. Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent with potent antiangiogenic activity, was used as a prototype drug. We synthesized the aldehyde poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) (aldehyde-PEG-PLA) block copolymer by ring opening polymerization. The nanoparticles loading paclitaxel (PTX-NP) were fabricated using the O/W emulsion and evaporation technique. K237 ligand, a peptide that can bind to the KDR receptors predominantly expressed on the surface of tumor neovasculature endothelial cells with high affinity and specificity and inhibit the VEGF-KDR angiogenic signal pathway, was conjugated to the aldehyde group of PEG chain using the N-terminal PEGylation technique. The K237 conjugated paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (K237-PTX-NP) had a hydrodynamic diameter of 150 nm. The K237 density on nanoparticle surface was 474 and the mean distance between two neighboring PEG chains linked to K237 peptide was 12 nm. The K237 conjugated nanoparticles could be significantly internalized by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) through the K237-KDR interaction, and this facilitated uptake led to the expected enhanced antiangiogenic activity shown by HUVEC proliferation, migration and tube formation compared to cells treated with the commercial formulation Taxol and PTX-NP. The long-circulating property and the K237 ligand of K237-PTX-NP warranted rapid, long-term, and accurate in vivo tumor neovasculature targeting, and thereafter the significant apoptosis of tumor neovasculature endothelial cells and necrosis of tumor tissues of MDA-MB-231 breast tumors implanted in female BLAB/c nude mice. This nanoparticulate DDS offers a new strategy for paclitaxel chemotherapy application and it could also be used to carry other chemotherapeutic drugs, genes, and proteins with antiangiogenic activity for antiangiogenic cancer therapy.",M3
20036827,"Drug delivery systems for potential treatment of intracellular bacterial infections.Despite the advent of a considerable number of new antibiotics, treatment of intracellular pathogens still represents a major pharmaceutical challenge. The antibiotic concentration in those specialized niches are often subtherapeutic, for which high doses of antibiotics must often be used.

There is therefore an urgent need for materials and methods to enable clinicians to achieve therapeutically effective intracellular concentration of those antibiotics which show good efficiency in vitro. In this setting, the possible use of drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) loaded with antibiotics that exhibit a high in vitro bactericidal activity deserves to be considered. Entrapping or encapsulating the drug within a delivery system provides a greater control of the pharmacokinetic behavior of the active molecule. This more efficient use of antibiotics may diminish their drawbacks and provide the basis for shortening the current time required by classical treatments. This review will focus on the role of DDS as a potential tool against intracellular bacteria.",M3
20015633,"Antitumour activity of NK012, SN-38-incorporating polymeric micelles, in hypovascular orthotopic pancreatic tumour.Human pancreatic cancer is refractory to chemotherapy partly because of blockage to penetration of anticancer agents. This issue must be taken into account particularly for the drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>). The aim of the present study is to investigate how NK012 (SN-38-incorporating polymeric micelles) categorised as DDS exerts its antitumour effect in an orthotopic pancreatic tumour model compared with gemcitabine and irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), a low-molecular-weight prodrug of a 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38). The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of NK012 (30 mg/kg/d), CPT-11 (66.7 mg/kg/d) and gemcitabine (16.5mg/kg/d) were administered to mice bearing human pancreatic cancer cell (SUIT-2) xenografts implanted orthotopically. Antitumour effects of these compounds were evaluated. Drug distribution within the tumour was examined by fluorescence microscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). NK012 exerted potent antitumour effects compared with CPT-11 and gemcitabine. A high concentration of NK012 and SN-38 released from NK012 had been observed until 192h. On the other hand, SN-38 converted from CPT-11 was detected only 1h postinjection. Fluorescence from NK012 was detected up to 48h, whereas that from CPT-11 almost disappeared by 24h postinjection. NK012 appeared to exert potent antitumour activity against intractable stroma-rich orthotopic pancreatic tumour xenografts due to its sufficient accumulation followed by the effective sustained release of SN-38 from NK012.",M3
19952519,"[Elucidation of accelerated blood clearance phenomenon caused by repeat injection of PEGylated nanocarriers]Liposomes modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) can stably exist in the bloodstream because the PEG on the liposomes attracts a water shell to the liposomal surface. Since these liposomes are long circulating nanocarriers, they are used as drug and gene delivery tools. Repeat injection of PEGylated liposomes, however, is known to induce the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon. In the ABC phenomenon, PEGylated liposomes that are injected subsequent to the first injection are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream and accumulate in the liver, resulting in loss of their long-circulating characteristics. The induction of ABC phenomenon is related to the production of anti-PEG IgM from splenic B cells. To elucidate the mechanism of the phenomenon, we firstly examined the relationship between the induction of ABC phenomenon and the concentration of PEGylated liposomes, and observed that the high dose of those did not induce the phenomenon. Next, we investigated whether polymeric micelles trigger ABC phenomenon or not. Finally, the size-dependency of ABC phenomenon was investigated by use of variously sized PEGylated liposomes and polymeric micelles having PEG chains. Our data suggest that the initiation of ABC phenomenon would be size-dependent, and particles smaller than 30 nm did not induce ABC phenomenon. We anticipate that the elucidation of the ABC phenomenon will be helpful for the development of <e>DDS</e> formulations.",M3
19877197,"Chronic vocal fold scar restoration with hepatocyte growth factor hydrogel.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Therapeutic challenges exist in the management of vocal fold scarring. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic potential of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the management of acute phase vocal fold scarring using a novel hydrogel-based HGF drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>). However, the effect of HGF on matured vocal fold scarring remains unclear. The current study aims to investigate the effect of HGF-DDS on chronic vocal fold scarring using a canine model. STUDY DESIGN: Animal model. METHODS: Vocal folds from eight beagles were unilaterally scarred by stripping the entire layer of the lamina propria; contralateral vocal folds were kept intact as normal controls. Six months after the procedures, hydrogels (0.5 mL) containing 1 microg of HGF were injected into the scarred vocal folds of four dogs (HGF-treated group). Hydrogels containing saline solution were injected into the other four dogs (sham group). Histological and vibratory examinations on excised larynges were completed for each group 9 months after the initial surgery. RESULTS: Experiments conducted on excised larynges demonstrated significantly better vibrations in the HGF-treated group in terms of mucosal wave amplitude. Although phonation threshold pressure was significantly lower in the HGF-treated group compared with the sham group, no significant differences were observed in the normalized glottal gap between HGF-treated and sham groups. Histological examinations of the HGF-treated vocal folds showed reduced collagen deposition and less tissue contraction with favorable restoration of hyaluronic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that administration of HGF may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic vocal fold scarring.",M3
19836833,"The performance of doxorubicin encapsulated in chitosan-dextran sulphate microparticles in an osteosarcoma model.Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer affecting children and adolescents. It is potentially debilitating and fatal due to pulmonary metastasis. A common management strategy, chemotherapy, has a 10-year disease-free survival of approximately 60%. However, a targeted approach to OS tumor inhibition is still lacking, calling for improved management strategies. A frontline drug for OS, doxorubicin (DOX), causes multiple side-effects (example myelosuppression, heart failure, hepatic toxicity, alopecia) in patients, especially in high doses required to control tumor growth. A drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) was developed to deliver DOX specifically to tumor sites. Through DOX encapsulation into chitosan DDS via the complex coacervation method with dextran sulphate, novel DOX microparticles (DMPs), with a DOX loading content of more than 99%, were formed. Multiple optimisation steps produced DMPs which caused OS cell death through apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death. Treatment of mice bearing orthotopic OS with DMP decreased tumor volume, decreased bone lysis, and reduced secondary metastasis to the lungs. DMP-treated mice also maintained their weight and did not appear to suffer from any visible side-effects such as heart failure or dry skin. Thus, DMP may prove to be a useful DDS platform clinically provided further studies are performed to rigorously validate this technology.",M3

19755155,"Utilising atomic force microscopy for the characterisation of nanoscale drug delivery systems.The introduction of atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques has revolutionised our ability to characterise colloidal objects. AFM allows the visualisation of samples with sub-nanometre resolution in three dimensions in atmospheric or submerged conditions. Nanomedical research is increasingly focused on the design, characterisation and delivery of nano-sized drug carriers such as nanoparticles, liposomes and polyplexes, and this review aims to highlight the scope and advantages of AFM in this area. A significant amount of work has been carried out in drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) research in recent years using a large variety of techniques. The use of AFM has enabled us to directly observe very small objects without the need of a cumbersome and potentially contaminating sample preparation. Thus, nanoscale DDS can be investigated in a controlled environment without the necessity of staining or drying. Moreover, intermittent contact mode AFM allows the investigation of soft samples with minimal sample alteration; phase imaging allows accessing information beyond the sample's topography and also differentiating between different materials, and force spectroscopy experiments help us to understand the intrinsic structure of DDS by recording the elastic or adhesion behaviour of particles. Hence, AFM enables us accessing information which is hardly available by other experimental techniques. It has provided invaluable information about physicochemical properties and helped to shed light on the area of nanoscale drug delivery and will, with more and more sophisticated equipment becoming available, continue to add to our understanding of the behaviour of nanoscale DDS in the future.",M3

19690617,"Multi-modality therapeutics with potent anti-tumor effects: photochemical internalization enhances delivery of the fusion toxin scFvMEL/rGel.BACKGROUND: There is a need for drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) that can enhance cytosolic delivery of anti-cancer drugs trapped in the endo-lysosomal compartments. Exposure of cells to specific photosensitizers followed by light exposure (photochemical internalization, PCI) results in transfer of agents from the endocytic compartment into the cytosol. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The recombinant single-chain fusion construct scFvMEL/rGel is composed of an antibody targeting the progenitor marker HMW-MAA/NG2/MGP/gp240 and the highly effective toxin gelonin (rGel). Here we demonstrate enhanced tumor cell selectivity, cytosolic delivery and anti-tumor activity by applying PCI of scFvMEL/rGel. PCI performed by light activation of cells co-incubated with scFvMEL/rGel and the endo-lysosomal targeting photosensitizers AlPcS(2a) or TPPS(2a) resulted in enhanced cytotoxic effects against antigen-positive cell lines, while no differences in cytotoxicity between the scFvMEL/rGel and rGel were observed in antigen-negative cells. Mice bearing well-developed melanoma (A-375) xenografts (50-100 mm(3)) were treated with PCI of scFvMEL/rGel. By 30 days after injection, approximately 100% of mice in the control groups had tumors&gt;800 mm(3). In contrast, by day 40, 50% of mice in the PCI of scFvMEL/rGel combination group had tumors&lt;800 mm(3) with no increase in tumor size up to 110 days. PCI of scFvMEL/rGel resulted in a synergistic effect (p&lt;0.05) and complete regression (CR) in 33% of tumor-bearing mice (n = 12). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is a unique demonstration that a non-invasive multi-modality approach combining a recombinant, targeted therapeutic such as scFvMEL/rGel and PCI act in concert to provide potent in vivo efficacy without sacrificing selectivity or enhancing toxicity. The present DDS warrants further evaluation of its clinical potential.",M3

19625131,"Could local delivery of bisphosphonates be a new therapeutic choice for hemangiomas?Hemangiomas are endothelial neoplasms that affected about 8-12% of one-year-old children. Their life cycle is characterized by a rapid endothelial proliferation phase, followed by a slow involution phase. About 10% of the hemangiomas will cause functional complications or psychological concern requiring active treatments. Current therapy methods, such as intra-lesional or systemic administration of corticosteroids, systemic interferon treatment, or surgery, are diverse but uncertainty. To date, the etiology of hemangiomas is still controversial. However, general consensus on the importance of the endothelial cells leads hemangioma pathogenesis to angiogenesis. Thus, local delivery of anti-angiogenic agents may be of great interest for the treatment of hemangiomas. Bisphosphonates are potent in inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting apoptosis, which are widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and osteolysis diseases with minor adverse side effects. In addition to its anti-osteolytic effect, bisphosphonates are currently shown to be capable of anti-angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. Experimental evidences demonstrated that bisphosphonates can inhibit capillary tube formation and vessel sprouting by impairing endothelial proliferation and migration, as well as reducing the serum fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, it is not impossible to deliver bisphosphonates to local lesion by a new local drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>), which employed the biocompatible calcium phosphate as the drug carriers for clinical use. This local drug delivery system is a suitable carrier for loading and releasing of bioactive bisphosphonates. Therefore, we hypothesis that local deliver of bisphosphonates by fine calcium phosphate particles may be a potential treatment of hemangiomas. By employing proper calcium phosphate particles, bioactive bisphosphonates will be gradually released and exert their anti-angiogenesis effect, destructing rapid proliferation of epithelial cells and promoting the involution of hemangiomas without systematic adverse side effects.",M3

Furthermore, the preparation of composite powders applicable to matrix-type DDS was developed by making a mechanical application to the surface radical-containing polymer powders with drug powders. In applications for biomedical engineering, the novel method to introduce the durable surface hydrophilicity and lubricity on hydrophobic biomedical polymers was developed by plasma-assisted immobilization of carboxyl group-containing polymer on the polymer substrate. The surfaces thus prepared were further used for the covalent immobilization of oligo-nucleotides (DNA) onto the polymer surfaces applicable to constructing DNA diagnosis system, and also plasma-assisted preparation of functionalized chemo-embolic agent of vinyl alcohol-sodium acrylate copolymer (PVA- PAANa).",M3
19445981,"Drug delivery systems in HIV pharmacotherapy: what has been done and the challenges standing ahead.Worldwide, over 40 million people are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The High Activity Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) combines at least three antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and, for over a decade, has been used to extend the lifespan of the HIV-infected patients. Chronic intake of HAART is mandatory to control HIV infection. The frequent administration of several drugs in relatively high doses is a main cause of patient incompliance and a hurdle toward the fulfillment of the pharmacotherapy. High adherence to HAART does not lead to complete HIV virus elimination from the host. Intracellular and anatomical viral reservoirs are responsible for the perpetuation of the infection. Active transport mechanisms involving proteins of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily prevent the penetration of ARV drugs into the brain and may account for the limited bioavailability after oral administration. A new research that addresses from simple organoleptic or technological problems to more complex issues involving the targeting of specific tissues and organs has emerged. With the aim to reduce dosing frequency, to improve the compliance of the existing pharmacotherapy and to target viral reservoirs, the design of drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) is becoming complementary to new drug discovery. Based on the common molecular features that characterize the different families of ARV drugs, the present review describes state-of-the-art ARV DDS and thoroughly discusses the challenges in the development of medicines with enhanced biopharmaceutical properties. In addition, a number of specific issues such as pediatric HAART, preventive pharmacotherapy and specific HIV-associated ethical issues are addressed in an integrative manner. Finally, the impact of such novel drug development on the Pharmaceutical Technology field is discussed.",M3

19440379,"Adenovirus dodecahedron, as a drug delivery vector.BACKGROUND: Bleomycin (BLM) is an anticancer antibiotic used in many cancer regimens. Its utility is limited by systemic toxicity and dose-dependent pneumonitis able to progress to lung fibrosis. The latter can affect up to nearly 50% of the total patient population, out of which 3% will die. We propose to improve BLM delivery by tethering it to an efficient delivery vector. Adenovirus (Ad) dodecahedron base (DB) is a particulate vector composed of 12 copies of a pentameric viral protein responsible for virus penetration. The vector efficiently penetrates the plasma membrane, is liberated in the cytoplasm and has a propensity to concentrate around the nucleus; up to 300000 particles can be observed in one cell in vitro. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Dodecahedron (Dd) structure is preserved at up to about 50 degrees C at pH 7-8 and during dialysis, freezing and drying in the speed-vac in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate, as well as during lyophilization in the presence of cryoprotectants. The vector is also stable in human serum for 2 h at 37 degrees C. We prepared a Dd-BLM conjugate which upon penetration induced death of transformed cells. Similarly to free bleomycin, Dd-BLM caused dsDNA breaks. Significantly, effective cytotoxic concentration of BLM delivered with Dd was 100 times lower than that of free bleomycin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Stability studies show that <e>Dds</e> can be conveniently stored and transported, and can potentially be used for therapeutic purposes under various climates. Successful BLM delivery by Ad Dds demonstrates that the use of virus like particle (VLP) results in significantly improved drug bioavailability. These experiments open new vistas for delivery of non-permeant labile drugs.",M3

DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, single-masked, controlled trial. METHODS: Three hundred and fifteen patients with persistent (&gt;or= 90 days) ME were randomized in a multicenter study to surgical placement of 350 or 700 microg dexamethasone DDS or observation. This study evaluated the subset of patients with uveitis or Irvine-Gass syndrome (n = 41). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving a 10-letter or more improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at day 90. Change in fluorescein angiographic leakage and safety also were evaluated. RESULTS: At day 90, a 10-letter or more BCVA improvement was seen in 41.7% (5/12) of patients in the 350-microg group, in 53.8% (7/13) of patients in the 700-microg group, and in 14.3% (2/14) of patients in the observation group (P = .029 vs the 700-microg group). Improvement in visual acuity persisted to day 180. A 15-letter or more improvement was achieved in 53.8% (7/13) of 700-microg patients vs 7.1% (1/14) of observed patients (P = .008). There were significantly greater reductions in fluorescein leakage in treated patients than in observed patients. Dexamethasone DDS was well tolerated. Throughout the study, an increase in intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg or more was seen in 5 of 13 patients in the 700-microg group, in 1 of 12 patients in the 350-microg group, and in no patients in the observation group.

19222790,"Light-sensitive intelligent drug delivery systems.Drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) capable of releasing an active molecule at the appropriate site and at a rate that adjusts in response to the progression of the disease or to certain functions/biorhythms of the organism are particularly appealing. Biocompatible materials sensitive to certain physiological variables or external physicochemical stimuli (intelligent materials) can be used for achieving this aim. Light-responsiveness is receiving increasing attention owing to the possibility of developing materials sensitive to innocuous electromagnetic radiation (mainly in the UV, visible and near-infrared range), which can be applied on demand at well delimited sites of the body. Some light-responsive DDS are of a single use (i.e. the light triggers an irreversible structural change that provokes the delivery of the entire dose) while others able to undergo reversible structural changes when cycles of light/dark are applied, behave as multi-switchable carriers (releasing the drug in a pulsatile manner). In this review, the mechanisms used to develop polymeric micelles, gels, liposomes and nanocomposites with light-sensitiveness are analyzed. Examples of the capability of some polymeric, lipidic and inorganic structures to regulate the release of small solutes and biomacromolecules are presented and the potential of light-sensitive carriers as functional components of intelligent DDS is discussed.",M3

The DDS consists of in situ forming hydrogel matrix (Pluronic F127 plus sodium hyaluronate) containing microspheres (MS). The solid MS were used for long-term release of the drugs. Both hydrogel matrix and MS contained a model drug, bupivacaine base (BB). The phase transition (liquid at room temperature, gel at around body temperature) could be manipulated by changing the composition of the hydrogel.

19160026,"Size effect of PLGA spheres on drug loading efficiency and release profiles.Drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) based on poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres and nanospheres have been separately studied in previous works as a means of delivering bioactive compounds over an extended period of time. In the present study, two DDS having different sizes of the PLGA spheres were compared in morphology, drug (dexamethasone) loading efficiency and drug release kinetics in order to investigate their feasibility with regard to production of medical combination devices for orthopedic applications. The loaded PLGA spheres have been produced by the oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method following two different schemes. Their morphology was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and the drug release was monitored in phosphate buffer saline solution at 37 degrees C for 550 h using high performance liquid chromatography. The synthesis schemes used produced spheres with two different and reproducible size ranges (20 +/- 10 and 1.0 +/- 0.4 microm) having a smooth outer surface and regular shape. The drug loading efficiency of the 1.0 microm spheres was found to be 11% as compared to just 1% for the 20 microm spheres. Over the 550 h release period, the larger spheres (diameter 20 +/- 10 microm) released 90% of the encapsulated dexamethasone in an approximately linear fashion whilst the relatively small spheres (diameter 1.0 +/- 0.4 microm) released only 30% of the initially loaded dexamethasone, from which 20% within the first 25 h. The changes observed were mainly attributed to the difference in surface area between the two types of spheres as the surface texture of both systems was visibly similar. As the surface area per unit volume increases in the synthesis mixture, as is the case for the 1.0 microm spheres formulation, the amount of polymer-water interfaces increases allowing more dexamethasone to be encapsulated by the emerging polymer spheres. Similarly, during the release phase, as the surface area per unit volume increases, the rate of inclusion of water into the polymer increases, permitting faster diffusion of dexamethasone.",M3

In this study, honokiol (HK) loaded micelles were prepared from biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCEC) copolymers. Micelles were prepared by self-assembly of triblock copolymer PCEC in distilled water triggered by its amphiphilic character without any organic solvent. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were determined by adjusting the weight ratio of HK and PCEC. The particle size and zeta potential distribution of obtained micelles were determined using Malvern laser particle sizer, and spherical geometry were observed on atomic force microscope (AFM). Otherwise, the thermo-sensitivity of honokiol-loaded micelles was monitored. And the cytotoxicity results of drug loaded micelles showed that the encapsulated honokiol remained potent antitumor effect. Moreover, in vitro release profile demonstrated a significant difference between rapid release of free honokiol and much slower and sustained release of HK-loaded micelles. These results suggested that we have successfully prepared honokiol-loaded micelles in an improved method which is safer and more efficient.

This work was designed to investigate a new micellar delivery system for in vitro reversal of resistant ovarian tumor cells, based on a nonionic triblock copolymer Pluronic P105 and paclitaxel (PTX). The PTX-loaded polymeric micelles (P105/PTX) were prepared by thin film-hydration methods. Based on the results of single factor experiments, the P105/PTX micelle formulation was optimized by employing the central composite design-response surface methodology. The physico-chemical properties of the P105/PTX micelles were characterized, including micelle size, drug loading coefficient, in vitro release behavior, etc. The cytotoxicity of the P105/PTX micelles was assessed against human ovarian tumor cell line, SKOV-3/PTX, by a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl (MTT) assay. In order to understand the possible mechanism of Pluronic effects in resistant tumor cells, cellular uptake study of micellar PTX or Rhodamine-123 (R-123) was also carried out. The results showed that the micelle size was about 24 nm with drug loading coefficient of 1.1% and PTX concentration of 700 microg x mL(-1). The cumulative release amount of PTX from the P105/PTX micelles was only 45.4% in 6 h (P &lt; 0.05) and 79.6% in 24 h, whereas Taxol injection in 6 h released 95.2% PTX. The IC50 values of the P105/PTX micelles and Taxol injection against SKOV-3/PTX were 1.14 and 5.11 microg x mL(-1), and resistance reversion index (RRI) was 9.65 and 2.15, respectively. The micellar PTX or R-123 exhibited a significant increase in cellular uptake in resistant SKOV-3/PTX cells compared with free PTX or R-123. These results indicated that PTX could effectively be solubilized by Pluronic P105 block copolymers via thin film-hydration process and formulation optimization, producing nano-scale polymeric micelles with sustained release property in vitro. The P105/PTX micelles were effectively able to reverse resistance to PTX in SKOV-3/PTX tumor cells compared with Taxol injection or free PTX solution, and the enhanced cytotoxicity in the resistant SKOV-3/PTX cell was related to the improved cellular uptake of PTX by Pluronic P105 copolymers.",M3
18819869,"[In vitro drug release from a mitomycin C delivery system and its effect against scar tissue adhesion in vivo]OBJECTIVE: To develop a chitosan (CH)/polyethylene glycols succinate acid (PEG-SA)-mediated mitomycin C (MMC) delivery system and investigate its drug release characteristics in vitro and its effect against scar tissue adhesion in vivo. METHODS: Mitomycin C loading in the composite CH/PEG-SA/MMC films was determined using ultraviolet. The freeze-dried films were dispersed in 1 ml PBS (pH7.4) and mitomycin C release in vitro was determined according to the mitomycin C concentration-UV value standard curve. The influence of the film structure on the drug release was evaluated. The drug delivery system was then implanted in SD rats, and 4 weeks later, immunohistochemical and histological examinations were carried out to assess the therapeutic effect on epidural scar tissue. RESULTS: The linear regression equation of the mitomycin C concentration-UV value standard curve was y=0.593x(3)-2.563x(2)+25.944x-0.236 (R(2)=1.000). The film demonstrated good drug delivery capability, and 20 mg of the samples in PBS showed a peak mitomycin C release after 12 days of 14.9616 microg/ml, which was higher than the ID(50) of mitomycin C (10.4713 microg/l) to the fibroblasts. On days 18 and 32, another two drug release peaks occurred (14.4824 microg/ml and 11.4092 microg/ml, respectively), followed by maintenance of slow release. Till day 60, the accumulative mitomycin release reached 0.1793 microg/ml, and the loaded drug was ultimately completely released. Significant differences were noted in the hydroxyproline content in the scar tissues of different groups (F=12.085, P=0.000), and the CH/PEG-SA/MMC <e>DDS</e> reduced the amount of scar tissue and promoted its orderly alignment to control potential scar hyperplasia that may compress the spinal cord and nerve roots.

Novel NIPA emulsion gels, i.e., NIPA hydrogels containing distributed oil (oleyl alcohol) microdroplets, were synthesized by means of an emulsion-gelation method in which the polymerization of hydrogels in an aqueous phase in an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion and the loading of a lipophilic drug (indomethacin) dissolved in an oil phase were accomplished simultaneously. The pulsatile (on-off) drug release from the NIPA emulsion gel loading indomethacin to a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution was successfully controlled by a temperature swing between 25 degrees C (release off) and 40 degrees C (release on). The mechanism of the pulsatile drug release was discussed in relation to the diffusion rate, distribution ratio, solvent exchange of NIPA hydrogels, and drug release from an NIPA organogel. The mechanism was as follows: the solvent exchange occurred within the NIPA emulsion gel (the NIPA gel-network absorbed oleyl alcohol with indomethacin) at temperatures above the LCST, and the diffusion rate of indomethacin through the solvent-exchanged gel was higher at 40 degrees C than at 25 degrees C.",M3

The resulting lithium ions and alphaparticles are high linear energy transfer (LET) particles which give a high biological effect. Their short range in tissue (5 - 9 mum) restricts radiation damage to those cells in which boron atoms are located at the time of neutron irradiation. BNCT has been applied clinically for the treatment of malignant brain tumors, malignant melanoma, head and neck cancer and hepatoma. Sodium mercaptoundecahydro-dodecaborate (Na(2)(10)B(12)H(11)SH: BSH) and borono-phenylalanine ((10)BPA) are currently being used in clinical treatments. These low molecule compounds are easily cleared from cancer cells and blood, so high accumulation and selective delivery of boron compounds into tumor tissues and cancer cells are most important to achieve effective BNCT and to avoid damage to adjacent healthy cells. OBJECTIVE: In order to achieve the selective delivery of boron atoms to cancer cells, a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) is an attractive intelligent technology for targeting and controlled release of drugs. METHODS: We performed literature searches related to boron delivery systems in vitro and in vivo.

The present study is a codification of a designed liposomal drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) for antineovascular therapy (ANET) with 2'-C-cyano-2'-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosylcytosine (CNDAC). The authors have previously reported that liposomalized 5'-O-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl CNDAC (DPP-CNDAC), a phospholipid derivative of the novel antitumor nucleoside CNDAC, is quite useful for ANET. DPP-CNDAC liposomes modified with APRPG, a peptide having affinity toward angiogenic vessels, efficiently suppressed tumor growth by damaging angiogenic endothelial cells. In the present study, the authors masked the hydrophilic moiety of DPP-CNDAC, namely, CNDAC, on the liposomal surface with APRPG-polyethyleneglycol (PEG) conjugate to improve the availability of DPP-CNDAC liposomes. The use of the APRPG-PEG conjugate attenuated the negative zeta-potential of the DPP-CNDAC liposomes and reduced the agglutinability of them in the presence of serum. These effects improved the blood level of DPP-CNDAC liposomes in colon 26 NL-17 tumor-bearing BALB/c male mice, resulting in enhanced accumulation of them in the tumor. Laser scanning microscopic observations indicated that APRPG-PEG-modified DPP-CNDAC liposomes (LipCNDAC/APRPG-PEG) colocalized with angiogenic vessels and strongly induced apoptosis of tumor cells, whereas PEG-modified DPP-CNDAC liposomes (LipCNDAC/PEG) did not. In fact, LipCNDAC/APRPG-PEG suppressed the tumor growth more strongly compared to LipCNDAC/PEG and increased significantly the life span of the mice. The present study is a good example of an effective liposomal DDS for ANET that is characterized by: (i) phospholipid derivatization of a certain anticancer drug to suit the liposomal formulation; (ii) PEG-shielding for masking undesirable properties of the drug on the liposomal surface; and (iii) active targeting to angiogenic endothelial cells using a specific probe.",M3

Since their discovery in the 1960s liposomes were recognized as models to study biological membranes and as versatile DDS of both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules. Liposomes--nanosized unilamellar phospholipid bilayer vesicles--undoubtedly represent the most extensively studied and advanced drug delivery vehicles. After a long period of research and development efforts, liposome-formulated drugs have now entered the clinics to treat cancer and systemic or local fungal infections, mainly because they are biologically inert and biocompatible and practically do not cause unwanted toxic or antigenic reactions. A novel, up-coming and promising therapy approach for the treatment of solid tumors is the depletion of macrophages, particularly tumor associated macrophages with bisphosphonate-containing liposomes. In the advent of the use of genetic material as therapeutic molecules the development of delivery systems to target such novel drug molecules to cells or to target organs becomes increasingly important. Liposomes, in particular lipid-DNA complexes termed lipoplexes, compete successfully with viral gene transfection systems in this field of application.

Histologic and vibratory examinations were completed for each group 6 months after the initial surgery. RESULTS: The excised larynx experiments showed significantly better vibration in terms of mucosal wave amplitude and glottal closure in the HGF-treated group compared to the sham group. Histologic evaluation of the vocal folds indicated remarkable reduction in collagen deposition and tissue contraction, with favorable restoration of hyaluronic acid and elastin in the HGF-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the novel HGF DDS may provide favorable effects in restoring the vibratory properties of scarred vocal folds.",M3
17975957,"Characterization of biodegradable poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles loaded with bacteriochlorophyll-a for photodynamic therapy.OBJECTIVE: Bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChl-a) was incorporated into nanoparticles of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), in order to evaluate this photosensitizer when associated with this specific drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) to analyze its physical and spectral properties. BACKGROUND DATA: It has been suggested in the literature that BChl-a is a potential sensitizer in photodynamic tumor therapy and until now has only been investigated in organic media. METHODS: Nanoparticles loaded with the photosensitizer BChl-a were prepared by the solvent evaporation technique. Parameters such as particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency, external morphology, and in vitro release behavior were evaluated. The photophysical properties (absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence quantum yields, and singlet oxygen quantum yields) of BChl-a, were investigated in toluene and when encapsulated in nanoparticles. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering revealed that particles loaded with BChl-a are spherical in shape, and they have a diameter of 660 nm and a low tendency to aggregate. The encapsulation efficiency obtained in this procedure was 69%. Spectroscopic analysis showed an absorption band centered at 782 nm in nanoparticles used as a DDS. Fluorescence quantum yield (phi(F) = 0.19) and higher efficiency in singlet oxygen production (Phi(Delta) = 0.26) was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this DDS is potentially useful for the delivery and release of BChl-a as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) protocols due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and maintenance of its spectroscopic properties when compared with other dyes in homogenous media. The biocompatible DDS medium is a new proposal and will make feasible the use of BChl-a as a dye for PDT, improving the utilization of non-organic media to deliver this kind of molecule.",M3
17970665,"Advances and challenges of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems.The ability to deliver highly efficient therapeutic compounds specifically to diseased sites is crucial for effectively treating all human illnesses. Unfortunately, conventional therapeutic strategies require unnecessarily high systemic administration due to non-specific biodistribution and rapid metabolism of free drug molecules prior to reaching their targeted sites. Using the tools of nanotechnology, drug delivery systems within the nanometer size regime can be developed to alter both pharmacological and therapeutic effects of drug molecules. Due to their small size, these novel <e>DDS</e> offer superior advantages, such as altered pharmacokinetic behaviour and improved payload, over traditional large-scale systems. In addition, the relative ease in modifying their surface chemistry permits the attachment of targeting and therapeutic molecules for specific therapeutic applications. Finally, complex nanostructures can be assembled using different building blocks with multiple functionalities ranging from targeting, detecting, imaging and therapeutic capabilities.",M3

On the other hand, tuberculosis, caused by tubercle bacilli which possess the ability to survive in phagosome and grow in cell, poses a serious problem as an intractable disease because the efficacy of drug delivery to the target bacilli is low. We have developed a new approach to therapy against intracellular bacteria using a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>), to deliver an effective amount of drug to the target site, based on the phagocytotic ability of macrophages. In this review, the development of an in vitro model of chronic infection by tubercle bacilli and therapy against tuberculosis using phagocytosis by macrophages and a DDS with microspheres are described.",M3
17870202,"The chick embryo and its chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) for the in vivo evaluation of drug delivery systems.Mammalian models are frequently used for preclinical evaluation of new drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>). However, valid mammalian models are expensive, time-consuming, and not easy to set up and evaluate. Furthermore, they are often linked to administrative burden with respect to ethical and legal aspects. The present review outlines the possibilities and limitations of using the hen's embryo, and specifically its chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), as an alternative to mammalian models for the evaluation of DDS. Features of the CAM, the anatomy of the embryo, and the blood were investigated to assess properties of the drug carriers such as toxicity and biocompatibility, as well as the activity, toxicity, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the drug. The simplicity, rapidity, and low cost of the different assays that can be performed with chick embryos strengthen the interest of routinely using this model in pharmaceutical technology research. It is concluded that there is a big potential for using chick embryos in screening procedures of formulation candidates, thus establishing an intermediate step between in vitro cellular tests and preclinical mammalian models.",M3
17827922,"[Development of drug delivery systems for targeting to macrophages]Drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) using liposomes as drug carriers for targeting to macrophages have been developed for the treatment of diseases that macrophages are related to their progress. Initially, DDS for the treatment of atherosclerosis are described. The influence of particle size on the drug delivery to atherosclerotic lesions that macrophages are richly present and antiatherosclerotic effects following intravenous administration of liposomes containing dexamethasone (DXM-liposomes) was investigated in atherogenic mice. Both the drug delivery efficacy of DXM-liposomes (particle size, 200 nm) to atherosclerotic lesions and their antiatherosclerotic effects were greater than those of 70 and 500 nm. These results indicate that there is an optimal particle size for drug delivery to atherosclerotic lesions. DDS for the treatment of respiratory infections are then described. The influence of particle size and surface mannosylation on the drug delivery to alveolar macrophages (AMs) and antibacterial effects following pulmonary administration of liposomes containing ciprofloxacin (CPFX-liposomes) was investigated in rats. The drug delivery efficacy of CPFX-liposomes to AMs was particle size-dependent over the range 100-1000 nm and then became constant at over 1000 nm. These results indicate that the most effective size is 1000 nm. Both the drug delivery efficacy of mannosylated CPFX-liposomes (particle size, 1000 nm) to AMs and their antibacterial effects were significantly greater than those of unmodified CPFX-liposomes. These results indicate that the surface mannosylation is useful method for drug delivery to AMs. This review provides useful information to help in the development of novel pharmaceutical formulations aimed at drug targeting to macrophages.",M3
17685579,"Targeted proapoptotic anticancer drug delivery system.A novel targeted proapoptotic anticancer drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) was developed and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The system contains poly(ethylene glycol) polymer (PEG) as a carrier, camptothecin (CPT) as an anticancer drug/cell death inducer, a synthetic analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) peptide as a targeting moiety/penetration enhancer, and a synthetic analogue of BCL2 homology 3 domain (BH3) peptide as a suppressor of cellular antiapoptotic defense. The design of the multicomponent DDS allowed for a conjugation of one or two copies of each active ingredient (CPT, LHRH, and BH3) to one molecule of PEG carrier. The complex structure of the PEG conjugates was visualized at nanometer resolution using atomic force microscopy. We found that the ligand-targeted DDS for cancer cells preferentially accumulated in the tumor and allowed the delivery of active ingredients into the cellular cytoplasm and nuclei of cancer cells. Simultaneous apoptosis induction through the caspase-dependent signaling pathway and inhibition of cellular antiapoptotic defense by the suppression of BCL2 protein enhanced cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of the entire DDS to a level which could not be achieved by individual components applied separately. The DDS containing two copies of each active component (CPT, LHRH, and BH3) per molecule of PEG polymer had the highest anticancer efficiency in vitro and in vivo.",M3

In-vitro and in-vivo tests were conducted to verify the performances of encapsulated PLGA nanospheres with three different hair growing ingredients. In the in-vitro tests, the scalp-pore permeability of hair growing ingredient encapsulated PLGA nanospheres (dispersed in the PBS solution) was examined using human scalp biopsies in a modified Bronaugh diffusion chamber in comparison to that of the control samples containing the hair growing ingredient in the PBS solution. Furthermore, the hair growing effect of the encapsulated PLGA nanospheres was evaluated with the C3H mice in the in-vivo tests. By observing the fluorescence intensity of the ingredients, as shown in the cross-section photographs of the human scalp biopsies, it was found that the dispersion liquids containing hair growing ingredient encapsulated PLGA nanospheres exerted a scalp-pore permeability 2.0- to 2.5-fold more marked than that of the control samples. Also, the hair growing activities were enhanced by using the encapsulated PLGA nanospheres, which transformed the hair growth cycle from the resting phase to the growing phase. As a result, the degree of hair growth was improved significantly. These results suggested that the PLGA nanosphere can be a new DDS carrier for delivering hair growing ingredients and drugs to the hair follicles.",M3

We propose to use this tissue adhesive for in-situ forming drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) for cancer chemotherapy. In a previous work, we had prepared a novel in-situ forming DDS composed of human serum albumin (HSA) and tartaric acid derivative (TAD) containing doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), and we had demonstrated an in vitro release profile of DOX from HSA-TAD gel for approximately up to 100h. Here, we report on antitumor effect of this injectable in-situ forming DDS. Local injection of DOX by the HSA-TAD was administered to human colon carcinoma (WiDr) implanted subcutaneously onto the immunodeficient mouse. The results of the in vivo experiments showed that the presence of DOX in blood of mice was detectable for up to 3days, and that the tumor volume was effectively minimized with injection of HSA-TAD containing DOX. The in-situ forming DDS with the novel tissue adhesive containing DOX, therefore, is a useful technique for cancer chemotherapy.",M3

Especially, the in vivo pinpoint delivery system for drugs is very important and key technology for developing the next generations of anti-cancer drugs and gene therapies. Bio-nanocapsule (BNC) is recombinant yeast-derived hepatitis B virus surface antigen particle, which has been used as a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine for the last 20 years in the world. BNC can incorporate various materials (chemical compounds, proteins, genes, siRNA, etc) by the fusion with liposome, and deliver them to the organs and tissues in vivo specifically by the action of bio-recognition molecules on the BNC's surface. The transfection efficiency is significantly higher than that of liposome, because BNC harbors the complete set of hepatitis B virus infection machinery. Recently, we succeeded in the in vivo retargeting of BNC by displaying either antibody or homing peptide, less than 10 amino acid residues for in vivo targeting. BNC is a hybrid of liposome and virus, and very flexible system for in vivo retargeting. BNC might be very promising carriers in the next generation of DDS.",M3
17473520,"[Development of intracellular drug delivery system using fusogenic liposomes]Drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) research has contributed greatly toward improving chemotherapy efficacy and reducing its adverse effects through the development of approaches to optimize pharmacokinetics, such as controlled release and targeting. On the other hand, the remarkable progress of this latest life science research has altered the concept of what constitutes medical supplies. A change in this concept would allow for the consideration of medical materials that use not only conventional low molecular-weight organic compounds, but also biomacromolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, that constitute living organisms. Although these biomacromolecular drugs are expected to demonstrate excellent efficacy based on their intrinsic bioactivity, they quickly degrade when administered in vivo and only a limited number have therefore been developed into medicines. In addition, most biomacromolecular drugs are ineffective until they are delivered to particular cells within a tissue or to particular organelles within a cell. To develop effective biomacromolecular medicines, it is necessary to introduce a DDS that is capable of ensuring internal stability as well as precise control of internal and intracellular dynamics, and to establish a new fundamental technology for DDS that can accommodate the material properties and mechanisms of action of the biomacromolecular drugs. In this context, this review introduces our approach to the design and creation of  Intracellular DDS  using fusogenic liposomes for application to gene therapy and tumor peptide vaccines.

METHODS: The coral-derived hydroxyapatite (CHA) was manufactured by hydrothermal exchange and impregnated with cisplatin by vacuum freeze-drying techniques. The leaching solutions of this DDS was collected at different intervals in a course of 8 weeks and their inhibitory effect on the cells was tested in vitro by MTT assay. RESULTS: Electron microscope showed that cisplatin was distributed homogeneously in the pores of CHA. The inhibition rates of the leaching solution on all the tumor cells exceeded 50% except for PC-3 cells, whose inhibition rate was 29.92% when treated with the solution collected at the eighth week.

17365277,"Toxicogenomics of drug delivery systems: Exploiting delivery system-induced changes in target gene expression to enhance siRNA activity.Synthetic siRNAs are typically formulated with drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) that improve cellular uptake for optimal gene silencing activity. Here, we show that two PAMAM dendrimer DDS, differing only in their structural architecture, elicit many different gene expression changes in human cells including opposing effects on the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a gene targeted for silencing by siRNA. Despite providing similar improvements in siRNA uptake, these two formulations led to a approximately 10-fold variation in anti-EGFR siRNA activity. These data show that gene expression changes induced by DDS, separate from their ability to enhance cell uptake, determine 'apparent' siRNA potency and thus offer the possibility of tailoring delivery system-siRNA combinations for additive or synergistic effects on gene silencing.",M3

METHODS: This 6-month study randomized 315 patients with persistent macular edema with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 to 20/200 in the study eye to observation or a single treatment with dexamethasone DDS, 350 or 700 microg. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients achieving a BCVA improvement of 10 or more letters or 15 or more letters, safety measures, change in fluorescein angiographic leakage, and central retinal thickness. RESULTS: At day 90 (primary end point), an improvement in BCVA of 10 letters or more was achieved by a greater proportion of patients treated with dexamethasone DDS, 700 microg (35%) or 350 microg (24%), than observed patients (13%; P&lt;.001 vs 700-microg group; P = .04 vs 350-microg group); an improvement in BCVA of 15 letters or more was achieved in 18% of patients treated with dexamethasone DDS, 700 microg, vs 6% of observed patients (P = .006). Results were similar in patients with diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion, or uveitis or Irvine-Gass syndrome. During 3 months of observation, 11% of treated patients and 2% of observed patients had intraocular pressure increases of 10 mm Hg or higher. CONCLUSION: In persistent macular edema, a single dexamethasone DDS treatment produced statistically significant BCVA improvements 90 days after treatment and was well tolerated for 180 days.

17331337,"Formulation, preparation and evaluation of flunarizine-loaded lipid microspheres.The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of preparing flunarizine-loaded lipid microspheres. Lipid microspheres (LMs) are excellent drug carriers for drug delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) and are relatively stable and easily mass-produced. They have no particular adverse effects. LMs have been widely studied as drug carriers for water-soluble drugs, lipid-soluble drugs and inadequately soluble (in water or in lipid) drugs, in that they have a lipid layer, a water layer and an emulsifier layer. Flunarizine (FZ), a poorly water-soluble drug, was incorporated in lipid microspheres to reduce side effects by avoiding the use of supplementary agents, compared with solution injection. After investigation, the final formulation was as follows: 10% oil phase (long-chain triglyceride (LCT); medium-chain fatty acid (MCT) = 50:50); 1.2% egg lecithin; 0.2% Tween-80; 2.5% glycerin; 0.3% dl-alpha-tocopherol; 0.02% EDTA; 0.03% sodium oleate; 0.1% FZ and double-distilled water to give a total volume of 100 mL. Homogenization was the main method of preparation and the best conditions were a temperature of 40 degrees C, a pressure of 700-800 bar and a suitable cycle frequency of about 10. The particle size distribution, zeta-potential and entrapment efficacy were found to be 198.7+/-54.0 nm, -26.4 mV and 96.2%, respectively. Its concentration in the preparation was 1.0 mg mL(-1). The lipid microspheres were stable during storage at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 3 months. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats using a dose of 1.0 mg kg(-1). The pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: AUC(0-t) 6.13 mug.h mL(-1), t(1/2) 5.32 h and Ke 0.16 L h(-1). The preparation data fitted a two-compartment model estimated by using 3p87 analysis software. From the observed data, FZ encapsulated in LMs did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic characteristic compared with the FZ solution injection and did not produce a delayed release effect, when it was released in-vivo in rats. However, the availability of the drug was increased. These results suggested that this LM system is a promising option for the preparation of the liquid form of FZ for intravenous administration.",M3

The results of the measurement of physicochemical characteristics indicate that the gelation time and gel strength of HSA-TAD gels can be controlled according to the material composition. The bonding strength of HSA-TAD adhesives was found to be sufficient to adhere at focus and to correspond with the cross-linking density of HSA-TAD gels. Furthermore, the release of DOX from HSA-TAD gels was sustained for approximately 100 h in an in vitro evaluation.

A topically applied vaginal microbicidal gel should provide uniform coating of vaginal tissue, retention of this gel layer prior to intercourse, and controlled release kinetics of antivirals to inactivate the viral load potentially introduced during sexual activity. Here, we describe the microbicide-oriented characterization of a DDS made with a dual pH sensitive and thermosensitive smart polymer gel composed of a random terpolymer of N-isopropyl acrylamide, butyl methacrylate, and acrylic acid. The system was engineered to coat vaginal tissue with a stable gel layer and to release entrapped model agents in a burst release profile in response to the presence of the infecting agent: semen. The gel rheology, layer erosion properties, model drug release kinetics, and cytocompatibility of the terpolymer system were studied. Negligible erosion of the gel in the presence of vaginal fluid simulant suggests prolonged retention.

17100558,"New generation of liposomal drugs for cancer.This review is focused on liposomes as a delivery system for anticancer agents and more specifically on the advantages of using liposomes as drug nanocarrier in cancer chemotherapy. The main advantages of liposomal drugs over the non-encapsulated drugs include: (1) improved pharmacokinetics and drug release, (2) enhanced intracellular penetration, (3) tumor targeting and preventing adverse side effects and (4) ability to include several active ingredients in one complex liposomal drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>).

As a conclusion we propose a novel liposomal DDS which includes inhibitors of pump resistance combined in one liposomal drug delivery system with an inhibitor of antiapoptotic cellular defense, an apoptosis inducer (a traditional anticancer drug) and a targeting moiety. The proposed drug delivery system utilizes a novel three tier approach, simultaneously targeting three molecular targets: (1) extracellular receptors or antigen expressed on the surface of plasma membrane of cancer cells in order to direct the whole system specifically to the tumor, preventing adverse side effects on healthy tissues; (2) drug efflux pumps in order to inhibit them and enhance drug retention by cancer cells, increasing intracellular drug accumulation and thereby limiting the need for prescribed high drug doses that cause adverse drug side effects; and (3) intracellular controlling mechanisms of apoptosis in order to suppress cellular antiapoptotic defense.",M3

Manipulation of the physical properties of DDS provides improved control over the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the encapsulated drugs relative to free drugs. Liposomes are the archetypical nanoscale DDS and the first of these received clinical approval in 1990. DOXIL, liposomal doxorubicin, was the first commercially available liposomal anticancer drug (1995). It has an enhanced circulation half-life compared to the free drug because of its surface-grafted polyethylene glycol coating. DOXIL passively targets solid tumors, and once the liposomes localize in the tumor interstitial space, the cytotoxic drug is slowly released within the tumor. Liposomes can act as sustained release delivery system and manipulation of properties such as, liposome diameter, drug release rate, bioavailability and dosing schedule can significantly impact the therapeutic outcome of the liposomal drugs. This review will focus on how alteration of these properties can impact the therapeutic efficacy and side effect profiles of DDS.",M3

We have already developed the unique transfection technique by preparing magnetic vector and using permanent magnet. This technique can improve the transfection efficiency. In this study, we directly associated plasmid DNA with magnetic nanoparticles, which can potentially enhance their transfection efficiency by magnetic force. Magnetic nanoparticle, such as magnetite, its average size of 18.7 nm, can be navigated by magnetic force and is basically consisted with oxidized Fe that is commonly used as the supplement drug for anemia. The magnetite particles coated with protamine sulfate, which gives a cationic surface charge onto the magnetite particle, significantly enhanced the transfection efficiency in vitro cell culture system. The magnetite particles coated with protamine sulfate also easily associated with cell surface, leading to high magnetic seeding percentage. From these results, it was found that the size and surface chemistry of magnetic particles would be tailored to meet specific demands on physical and biological characteristics accordingly. Overall, magnetic nanoparticles with different surface modification enhance the association with plasmid DNA and cell surface as well as HVJ-E, which potentially help to improve the drug delivery system.",M3

The mean aqueous dexamethasone concentration (ng/ml, +/- SD) was 1,015.42 (+/- 43.05), 970.11 (+/- 32.47) and 757.58 (+/- 30.19) and the mean vitreous concentration (ng/ml, +/- SD) was 399.82 (+/- 38.05), 287.38 (+/-34.47) and 268.15 (+/- 32.00) at 3, 6 and 9 days after the surgical procedure, respectively. No corneal or retinal histological changes were observed during the study period. CONCLUSION: The IOL-DDS is effective in delivering therapeutic concentrations of dexamethasone to the aqueous and vitreous, without acute damage to the cornea and retina. Further controlled studies in the same animal model are under way to determine the potential value of this lens in the prevention and treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery.",M3

16892815,"[Preparation of plastic nano-hydroxyapatite/poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate)-polymethyl lene glycol gentamicin drug delivery system]OBJECTIVE: To develop the plastic nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HA)/poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate)-polyethylene glycol (PHBV-PEG) gentamicin (GM) drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) (nano-HA/PHBV-PEG-GM-DDS) for treating osteomyelitis and find its releasing character in vivo. METHODS: The plastic nano-HA/PHBV-PEG-GM-DDS was prepared using nano-HA as the core carrier of GM, nano-HA with PHBV and PEG as coating and plastic fibrin glue(FG) as microsphere scaffold. The morphological features of nano-HA, drug loaded nano-HA and drug loaded nano-HA/PHBV-PEG microsphere were examined by electron microscope. The GM concentration it blood, cortex bone and cancellous bone was detected at 12 different time points by the method of K-B after the plastic nano-HA/PHBV-PEG-GM-DDS was implanted into the femora of 36 rabbits. Its GM releasing character was assayed in vivo. RESULTS: Nano-HA was similar to a blackjack, and its length was less than 60 nm. Drug loaded nano-HA appeared natural crystal condensate, of which surface adsorbed massive GM. The average grain diameter was 200.5 nm. Drug loaded nano-HA/PHBV-PEG microsphere had a shrinkable porous structure, of which surface configuration was consistent. The average grain diameter was 34.5 microm. The GM concentration and the antibacterial annulus was in the linear correlation. The correlation coefficient was 0.998. In cortex and cancellous bone tissue, the GM concentration was about 95.50 +/- 16.50 microg/ml and 80.20 +/- 13.80 microg/ml from the plastic nano-HA/PHBV-PEG-GM-DDS on the 1st day, then decreased gradually. After 56 days of operation, the GM concentration still exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for the staphylococcus aureus, but the peak level of serum GM concentration was under the nephrotoxicity concentration. CONCLUSION: Plastic nano-HA/PHBV-PEG-GM-DDS was a good drug delivery system with sustained antibiotic effect in vivo. It was an effective method for the treatment of osteomyelitis.",M3
16877400,"Sustained intraocular rapamycin delivery effectively prevents high-risk corneal allograft rejection and neovascularization in rabbits.PURPOSE: To evaluate the immunosuppressive and antiangiogenic activities of an intraocular rapamycin (RAPA) drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) in a rabbit model of high-risk penetrating keratoplasty. METHODS: Forty New Zealand White rabbits with corneal neovascularization underwent allograft cornea transplantation and were randomly divided into four groups: a control group, a glycolide-co-lactide-co-caprolactone copolymer (PGLC)-implanted group, a RAPA eye drop group, and a RAPA-PGLC DDS-implanted group. Graft survival, corneal neovascularization, and RAPA concentration in the aqueous humor were monitored for 90 days. Corneal grafts were also examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for proinflammatory gene expression. RESULTS: In the control and PGLC groups, graft rejection occurred within 3 weeks of keratoplasty. In the RAPA eye drop and RAPA-PGLC groups, corneal rejection was significantly delayed, and neovascularization was markedly inhibited. Median graft survival times were 36 and &gt;90 days in the eye drop and RAPA-PGLC groups, respectively. Mean RAPA concentrations in the aqueous humor were 10.7 ng/mL, 12.0 ng/mL, 9.2 ng/mL, and 7.0 ng/mL in the RAPA-PGLC group 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery, respectively. By contrast, RAPA was undetectable in the aqueous humor in the eye drop group. High levels of IL-2R, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and VEGF were detected in the corneal grafts of the control and PGLC groups but not in those of the RAPA-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA-PGLC DDS and RAPA eye drops can significantly prolong the survival of allografts at high risk and inhibit corneal neovascularization. However, RAPA-PGLC DDS is far more effective than RAPA eye drops in preventing corneal graft rejection.",M3
16819266,"[Novel pharmaceutical and biomedical applications of plasma techniques]The plasma-induced surface radicals formed on a variety of organic polymers have been studied in detail using electron-spin resonance (ESR) coupled with systematic computer simulations. On the basis of the findings from such studies on the nature of radical formation and radical reactivity, we were able to open up several novel pharmaceutical and biomedical applications in plasma treatment. In this review, applications using plasma-irradiated organic polymers are described, which include: 1) preparation of double-compressed tablets applicable for reservoir-type drug-delivery systems (<e>DDS</e>) for sustained and delayed release, intragastric floating DDS (FDDS) for oral controlled-release dosage forms with gastric retention capabilities, and fabrication of functionalized composite powders applicable for controlled drug release with the mechanical application of plasma-irradiated polymer powder; 2) an approach to  patient-tailored DDS,  administered by taking into account that the environment (pH, transit time, etc.) in the gastrointestinal tract varies with each patient, based on the combination of the above-mentioned DDS devices; 3) plasma-assisted promotion of seed germination of herbal medicines with hard coats; and 4) fabrication of polymer surfaces with durable hydrophilicity and lubricity using plasma techniques and the immobilization of oligo-nucleotides on hydrophilic polymer surfaces thus prepared applicable to constructing DNA diagnosis systems.",M3
16779692,"Local delivery system of immune modulating drug for unresectable adenocarcinoma: in vitro experimental study and in vivo animal study.The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a developed drug delivery system containing OK-432 through in vitro and animal study. An OK-432-impregnated polycarbonate/polyurethane stent membrane was used to develop a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) enabling the locoregional release of OK-432. Polyethyleneglycol was used as a detergent and porosity generator. The stability of OK-432 in solvent, releasing kinetics of drug, and cytotoxicity of the DDS were evaluated. OK-432-impregnated DDS was implanted in mice in which a human adenocarcinoma cell line was injected and grown in their back. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for quantifying the amount of drug. OK-432 exposed to phosphate-buffered saline and OK-432 exposed to N,N-dimethylacetamide showed similar results on dot graphs and histograms. However, OK-432 exposed to tetrahydrofurane showed different dot graphs and histograms, which means that the antigenicity of the drug was changed. The release rate of OK-432 was maintained at a constant level for 6 weeks. The local delivery of OK-432 was found to have an antitumor effect on a human adenocarcinoma cell line in an animal study, but no effect on this cell line in in vitro cell culture. Histologic examination showed minimal inflammatory reaction in surrounding tissue. Our study shows that local treatment using this OK-432 release system is safe and effective in reducing adenocarcinoma in a mouse model.",M3
16762236,"[Anti-infectious effect of sustained antravitreal amphotericin B drug delivery system on experimental rabbit fungal endophthalmitis of Candida albicans]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of sustained intravitreal amphotericin B drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) on experimental rabbit fungal endophthalmitis of Candida albicans. METHODS: Fifty New Zealand rabbits received central vitrectomy were followed by Candida albicans suspension (10(4) colony forming unit, cfu) injection. Rabbits were grouped randomly into five with ten in each as follows: Group A, endophthalmitis control group; Group B, DDS of vehicle alone; Group C, topical treatment with amphotericin B eyedrop; Group D, 5 microg of amphotericin B intravitreal injection every week for two weeks; Group E, DDS contained 1 mg of amphotericin B. Slit-lamp and indirect-ophthalmoscope were performed at different time for two months and vitreous opacity was compared between each group. The intraocular drug concentration was measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Light and electron microscope were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of DDS and the effect of vehicle on intraocular structure. Electroretinography (ERG) was employed to evaluate the function of retina before and after the implantation of DDS. RESULTS: Endophthalmitis was obviously inhibited in group E while vitreous was still opacity in other groups. The drug concentration in vitreous cavity was stable and remained for two months in group E while rapidly went down two weeks later in group D. No toxic evidence was found in ocular, liver and kidney tissue and retinal ultrastructure was normal. There was no difference in ERG study before and after the DDS was implanted. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained intravitreal amphotericin B DDS can significantly suppress the formation of fungal colony and inhibit the development of infection with long and stable intraocular drug concentration maintenance. The vehicle and amphotericin B DDS are safe to intraocular structure.",M3

METHODS: Corneal neo-vascularization was induced by 5 - 0 silk sutures in 68 New Zealand rabbits to establish a high risk corneal transplantation model. A unilateral 7 mm diameter central penetrating corneal transplantation was performed with 7.5 mm diameter grafts from health New Zealand rabbit donors. Grafted rabbits were randomized into five groups as follows: Group A: untreated control animals; Group B: DDS anterior chamber recipients without drug; Group C: 1 mg cyclosporine DDS anterior chamber recipients; Group D: 0.1% FK506-olive oil drop recipients; Group E: 0.5 mg FK506 DDS anterior chamber recipients. Grafts were examined with a slit lamp every other day and clinical conditions were scored for up to 28 weeks. The aqueous humor and cornea of Group D and Group E were collected, and the concentration of FK506 was determined. The expression of cytokines IL-2R alpha, MCP-1, Fas and FasL mRNA was detected with in situ hybridization method. RESULTS: The median survival time was (17.9 +/- 4.7) d in Group A (untreated corneal allograft), (20.0 +/- 3.7) d in Group B, (56.3 +/- 8.8) d in Group C, (78.1 +/- 7.2) d in Group D, and over 180 d in Group E. Statistically significant difference (F = 926.37, P = 0.0000) in the survival time of allograft has been found between Group E and other groups. The concentration of FK506 in aqueous humor was (15.7 +/- 2.6) ng/ml in Group E at one week and remained stable for at least 24 weeks, much higher than that in Group D (&lt;0.3 ng/ml). The concentration of FK506 in cornea was also higher in Group E than that in Group D. The expression of cytokines IL-2R alpha and MCP-1 mRNA was detected, but the expression of Fas and FasL mRNA was not detected in Group A. CONCLUSIONS: FK506 DDS implanted in the anterior chamber can significantly prolong corneal allograft survival in high-risk corneal graft rejection model. This intraocular DDS may be a valuable adjunct for the suppression of immune graft rejection in high-risk corneal transplants.",M3
16759827,"Development of pulsatile multiparticulate drug delivery system coated with aqueous dispersion Aquacoat ECD.The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a pulsatile multiparticulate drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>), coated with aqueous dispersion Aquacoat ECD. A rupturable pulsatile drug delivery system consists of (i) a drug core; (ii) a swelling layer, comprising a superdisintegrant and a binder; and (iii) an insoluble, water-permeable polymeric coating. Upon water ingress, the swellable layer expands, resulting in the rupturing of outer membrane with subsequent rapid drug release. Regarding the cores, the lag time was shorter, when 10% (w/w) theophylline was layered on sugar cores compared with cores consisting of 100% theophylline. Regarding swelling layer, the release after lag time was fast and complete, when cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose (AcDiSol) was used as a swelling agent. In contrast, a sustained release was achieved after the lag time, when low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC) and sodium starch glycolate (Explotab) were used as swelling agents. The optimal level of AcDiSol to achieve a fast and complete release after the lag time was 26% (w/w) (based on the weight of the coated pellets) for poorly soluble theophylline and 48% (w/w) for highly soluble propranolol HCl. The lag time can be controlled by the coating level of an outer membrane and increased with increasing coating level of the outer membrane. Outer membrane, formed using aqueous dispersion Aquacoat ECD was brittle and ruptured sufficiently to ensure fast drug release, compared to ethylcellulose membrane formed using organic solution. The addition of talc led to increase brittleness of membrane and was very advantageous because of (i) reduced sensitivity of lag time on variations in the coating level and (ii) fast and complete drug release. Drug release starts only after rupturing of outer membrane, which was illustrated by microscopical observation of pellet during release.",M3
16712453,"Promotion of optimized protein therapy by bioconjugation as a polymeric <e>DDS</e>.In recent years, clinical applications of recombinantly produced bioactive proteins such as cytokines have attracted attention. However, since these recombinant proteins are rather unstable in vivo, their clinical use as therapeutic agents requires frequent administration at a high dosage. This regimen disrupts homeostasis and results in severe side effects. To overcome these problems, bioactive proteins have been conjugated with water-soluble synthetic (WSS) polymeric carriers. Chemical modification of a protein with a WSS polymeric carrier (bioconjugation) regulates tissue distribution, resulting in a selective increase in its desirable therapeutic effects and a decrease in undesirable side effects. Among several drug delivery system (DDS) technologies, bioconjugation has been recognized as one of the most efficient methods for improving therapeutic potency of proteins. However, for further enhancement of the therapeutic potency and safety of conjugated bioactive proteins, more precise regulation of the in vivo behavior of each protein is necessary for selective expression of its therapeutic effect. Therefore, alternative WSS polymeric modifiers in which new functions such as targeting and controlled release of drugs can be added are required for further development of bioconjugated drugs. Recently, we have synthesized a novel polymeric drug carrier, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-dimethyl maleic anhydride) [PVD], which was a powerful candidate drug carrier for cancer therapy. In this review, we introduce useful information that enabled us to design polymeric drug carriers and their application for protein therapy.",M3

METHODS: (1) RAPA DDS preparation: 50 mg of PGLC and 50 mg of RAPA were mixed as a RAPA drug delivery system. (2) High risk rabbit model: Corneal vascularization was induced in 45 New Zealand white rabbits (45 eyes) by passing 5 - 0 silk sutures in corneal stroma in each quadrant. (3) 40 rabbits with corneal neovascularization beyond three quadrants were received a unilateral 7 mm diameter central PK. The 40 were divided into four treatment groups: Group A, control group and received no therapy; Group B, 1 mg PGLC carrier was implanted in the anterior chamber; Group C, 1% RAPA eye drops was applied four times daily; Group D, 0.5 mg RAPA DDS was implanted in the anterior chamber. (4) Postoperative examination: The cornea allografts (opacity, edema and neovascularization) were examined by the slit-lamp biomicroscopy for ninety days. Rejection index (RI) and neovascularization index (NI) of these animal models were recorded. RAPA concentration in the aqueous humor was detected on 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks in group C and D after surgery; the expressions of IL-2R, MCP-1, Fas/FasL in samples were detected with in situ hybridization; TNF-alpha and VEGF were detected with immuno-histochemical technique three weeks after the operation in all groups. Histochemical method was carried out on the procured specimens of cornea, retina, liver and kidney at ninety days. RESULTS: (1) Allografts rejection: Mean survival times in 4 trial groups were (16.5 +/- 2.5), (16.0 +/- 2.6), (47.1 +/- 13.2), (87.6 +/- 5.8) d respectively (P = 0.000). (2) Corneal neovascularization: Mean NI was 2.4 +/- 0.7, 2.1 +/- 0.5, 0.6 +/- 0.5, 0.3 +/- 0.5 (P = 0.000) 2 weeks after the operation, and the NI value was 3.8 +/- 0.5, 3.8 +/- 0.4, 0.8 +/- 0.7, 0.4 +/- 0.8 (P = 0.000) 12 weeks after the operation in groups A, B, C and D respectively. (3) RAPA concentration in aqueous humor: Mean RAPA concentration in aqueous humor was 10.7, 12.0, 9.2, 7.0 ng/ml in group D in the 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the operation respectively. RAPA can not be detected in group C. (4) Cytokine expression: IL-2R, MCP-1, TNF-alpha and VEGF were overexpression in group A and B, and undetectable in group C and D. Fas and FasL were negative in all groups. (5) No inflammatory cell infiltration was found in retina, liver and kidney tissue ninety days after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained RAPA DDS and eyedrops can prolong allograft survival and inhibit cornea neovascularization in rabbit model. However, RAPA DDS is better than eyedrops.",M3
16616604,"Effects of low-intensity focused ultrasound on the mouse submandibular gland.Ultrasound is expected to make a considerable contribution to drug delivery systems (<e>DDSs</e>). We tested the hypothesis that low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) increases vessel permeability in the mouse submandibular gland without causing parenchymal damage. In a preliminary study, LIFU at 3 W/cm2 with a 50% duty cycle for 2 minutes did not cause histologic damage. We therefore applied LIFU to mouse submandibular gland at these conditions before and after injecting horseradish peroxidase. Single labeling laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed positive horseradish peroxidase staining around the excretory ducts in the mucous-producing part of the gland, but absence of staining in control glands. Immunostaining for fibrinogen was positive in the same region. Fibrinogen is an intravascular protein that does not pass through intact vessels. These findings suggest that LIFU increases vessel permeability and disruption without destruction. It is anticipated that this process will be useful in establishing a DDS that uses LIFU.",M3

A nonbiodegradable implant was first used in 1996 for cytomegalovirus retinitis secondary to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Biodegradable implants, composed of hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers, in the shape of rods, plugs, discs or sheets have been investigated. An injectable rod is presently being assessed in a Phase III trial to treat macular oedema secondary to diabetic retinopathy or branch-retinal vein occlusion.

METHODS: PVR was induced in rabbits with core vitrectomy and fibroblast injection. The DDS containing 420 microg, 650 microg, and 1,070 microg of at-RA was implanted into the vitreous of treated groups B, C, and D, respectively. Group A with no DDS and group E with nonmedicated DDS served as controls. The intravitreal at-RA concentration was measured with high-pressure liquid chromatography. The drug toxicity was evaluated histologically. RESULTS: The severity of PVR was significantly reduced in groups C and D but not in groups A, B, and E. The drug release peaked at 6 weeks to 7 weeks. No signs of retinal toxicity were found in the DDS groups. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal implantation of at-RA DDS appears effective in inhibiting the development of PVR and is well tolerated in rabbit eyes.",M3

However, in the near future, not only  systemic pharmacokinetics  but also  intracellular pharmacokinetics  seems to be important in Drug Delivery System research. In this context, we have tried to develop the novel cytoplasmic nanoparticle (NP) delivery methods using fusogenic liposomes (FL) and protein transduction domain (PTD). In this study, we demonstrated that the FL efficiently delivered the encapsulated NP to the cytoplasm directly in a fusion -dependent. Oligonucleotides attached to NP were gradually released in the cytoplasm after its efficient delivery using FL. Furthermore, we have succeeded in identifying the novel PTD using phage displayed random peptide library. In near future, this novel PTDs are applied to cytoplasmic NP delivery carrier. From these results, we suggested that this technology is very important to control the intracellular pharmacokinetics, and can be also applied to any NP which will be produced by the nanotechnology in the future.",M3

16291730,"Molecular targeting of BCL2 and BCLXL proteins by synthetic BCL2 homology 3 domain peptide enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy.Chemotherapeutic agents are known to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis. The activation of cellular antiapoptotic defense that prevents the translation of drug-induced damage into cell death is the key factor in cellular antiapoptotic resistance that decreases the chemotherapeutic effectiveness of a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs. A novel proapoptotic anticancer drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) was designed to simultaneously induce apoptosis and suppress antiapoptotic cellular defense. The system includes three main components: 1) anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) as an apoptosis inducer, 2) synthetic BCL2 homology 3 domain (BH3) peptide as a suppressor of cellular antiapoptotic defense, and 3) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer as a carrier. The above DDS was studied in vitro using A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and in vivo on nude mice bearing xenografts of human ovarian tumor. The results obtained in both series of experiments corroborate each other. They show that the designed DDS provided intracellular delivery of active components and suppressed cellular antiapoptotic defense, leading to the more pronounced induction of caspase-dependent signaling pathway of apoptosis compared with CPT alone and simple CPT-PEG conjugate. Including BH3 peptide in complex DDS decreased apoptotic cellular defense, substantially increased toxicity of the whole complex, and provided high antitumor activity. Therefore, the proposed novel multicomponent proapoptotic anticancer drug delivery system has high potential to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.",M3
16282964,"[Liposomal amphotericin B]Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) is a <e>DDS</e> (drug delivery system) formulation of amphotericin B (AMPH-B), and has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity of AMPH-B while retaining its therapeutic efficacy. AMPH-B has been the  gold standard  of antifungal therapy over the past four decades. It has a broad spectrum of fungicidal activity against a number of clinically important pathogens including Aspergillus and Candida. The mechanism of action of AMPH-B involves binding to ergosterol, the principal sterol in fungal cell membranes. Binding to ergosterol causes an increase in fungal membrane permeability, electrolyte leakage, and cell death. AMPH-B has affinity for cholesterol in mammalian membranes, which leads to severe side-effects including kidney damage. AmBisome is a unilamellar vesicle composed of AMPH-B and phospholipid. Upon administration, AmBisome remains intact in the blood and distributes to the tissues where fungal infection may occur, and is disrupted after attachment to the outside of fungal cells, resulting in fungal cell death. AmBisome and AMPH-B show similar in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity and clinical efficacy. However, AmBisome has less infusion-related toxicity and nephrotoxicity than AMPH-B.",M3

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a biodegradable FK506 drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) implanted into anterior chamber for the prolongation of corneal allograft survival in high-risk keratoplasty. METHODS: Biodegradable glycolide-co-clatide-co-caprolactone polymer (PGLC) was used as drug carrier to be incorporated with 0.5 mg of FK506 powder. The drug release from the FK506-PGLC DDS was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The FK506-PGLC DDS was implanted into the anterior chamber of 12 high-risk keratoplasty rabbits. The graft survival time and clinical features of the FK506-PGLC DDS group were compared with the untreated, PGLC DDS, cyclosporin A-PGLC DDS, and 0.5% FK506 drops groups. The histopathological examination was performed to evaluate the safety of the FK506-PGLC DDS. RESULTS: The mean graft survival time was longest (&gt; 180 days) in the FK506-PGLC DDS group.

16226333,"Cultured skin loaded with tetracycline HCl and chloramphenicol as dermal delivery system: mathematical evaluation of the cultured skin containing antibiotics.Dermal patches consisting of cultured human skin with antibiotics, which have a protective effect on wound skin as well as a preventative effect on second infection of the skin, were prepared and mathematically analyzed as a new drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) that can be applied to serious skin defects such as severe burns. In the present study, a three-dimensional cultured human skin model (living skin equivalent-high, LSE-high) was used as a cultured skin membrane and tetracycline HCl (TC-HCl) and chloramphenicol (CP) were used as antibiotics. At first, antibiotics were entrapped in the LSE-high from the dermal side through culture medium in order to obtain a drug-loaded LSE-high. The antibiotic release from the drug-loaded LSE-high was then examined and the resulting release data were used to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient of the antibiotics (D(LSE)) and initial loading concentration of the antibiotics (C0) in the LSE-high. The release profile of TC-HCl was represented by general diffusion-limited kinetics, whereas an initial burst effect was found in the release profile of CP. Therefore, the burst effect was taken into account for analyzing the release profile of CP. Stripped skin excised from hairless rats was used as a wound model, and the antibiotic permeation through the skin from aqueous solution was examined and evaluated using differential equations for Fick's second law of diffusion to obtain the effective diffusion coefficient of the antibiotics in the wound skin (D(skin)). Furthermore, the antibiotic permeation profile through the excised stripped skin from the drug-loaded LSE-high was measured and theoretically evaluated by Fick's second law of diffusion with previously obtained parameters (C0, D(LSE), D(skin)) using a newly constructed two- or three-layered diffusion model. The calculated concentrations of TC-HCl and CP in the upper epidermis of the model wound skin were over their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for several hours against various bacteria, suggesting that this dosage system is useful for the treatment of severe burns. In addition, the present analytical method and diffusion model, with the drug-loaded LSE-high and stripped rat skin, are useful tools for evaluating this new DDS.",M3
16171884,"Preparation of a novel PEG-clay hybrid as a <e>DDS</e> material: dispersion stability and sustained release profiles.An advanced hybrid drug carrier has been developed using porous nanocrystals of a swelling clay mineral conjugated with a block copolymer containing poly(ethylene glycol) and polyamine segments. Synthetic hectorite (Laponite) modified with (alpha-acetal-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-[poly(2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate)] (Acetal-PEG-b-PAMA) produced a homogeneous dispersion of organic-inorganic hybrid in an aqueous solution, which showed flocculation-resistive properties with an elevated ionic strength. The zeta-potential measurement revealed that nonionic PEG brush layers are formed on the surface of the clay nanocrystals since negative charge of the clay surface was completely neutralized by the positive charge of the cationic PAMA segment and the entire surface charge is successfully shielded by the effect of nonionic PEG segment in the block copolymer. This charge neutralization is in good agreement with the dispersion stability in solutions of high ionic strength. The average particle size of the PEG-modified hybrid particle was estimated to be 120 nm by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. When pyrene was used as the model compound of hydrophobic drug, it was incorporated into the nanopore in the clay mineral without showing any remarkable expansion of the basal spacings. Fluorescence spectra and powder X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that pyrene molecules are captured in an amorphous state in the range of low pyrene content (&lt;5%), while excimer formation was seen at the higher pyrene concentration (&gt;5%). The PEG-clay hybrid act as a carrier for sustained release of hydrophobic substances due to the high affinity (K = 1.52 x 10(4)) between the drug and clay surface.",M3
16163496,"Intravitreal implantation of the biodegradable cyclosporin A drug delivery system for experimental chronic uveitis.PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of the intravitreal implantation of the biodegradable cyclosporin A (CsA) drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) for experimental chronic uveitis. METHODS: The DDS was prepared by formulating CsA into glycolide-co-lactide-co-caprolactone copolymer (PGLC). Right eyes of 30 New Zealand white rabbits were used to establish a model of uveitis and randomized into control, intravitreal non-medicated DDS, oral CsA (15 mg/kg daily), and intravitreal CsA-PGLC DDS (each containing 2 mg CsA) groups. The progress of ocular inflammation, results of electroretinography, and histopathological examination of ocular, renal, and hepatic functions were recorded. Intravitreal CsA levels were measured in another 13 rabbits receiving an implant of the CsA-PGLC DDS. RESULTS: Chronic uveitis was successfully induced in all 30 eyes. The inflammation in the eyes with no treatment, non-medicated implant, and oral CsA was more severe than those with the CsA-PGLC DDS at each timepoint. The electroretinography b-wave was depressed much less in the CsA-PGLC DDS group than in the other three groups (p&lt;0.05). No renal or hepatic tissue damage was found in eyes with the CsA-PGLC DDS. The mean intravitreal CsA level was 102.2~145.5 ng/ml at 1~3 weeks after CsA-PGLC DDS implantation, 491.0~575.2 ng/ml at 4~10 weeks, and 257.3 ng/ml at 14 weeks; no toxicity was detected. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal implantation of the biodegradable CsA-PGLC DDS may effectively reduce the intraocular inflammation in rabbits with no toxicity, which provides a potentially safe and convenient approach for the treatment of chronic uveitis.",M3
16123131,"Tumor-specific targeting of an anticancer drug delivery system by LHRH peptide.The central problem in cancer chemotherapy is the severe toxic side effects of anticancer drugs on healthy tissues. Invariably the side effects impose dose reduction, treatment delay, or discontinuance of therapy. To limit the adverse side effects of cancer chemotherapy on healthy organs, we proposed a drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) with specific targeting ligands for cancer cells. The proposed DDS minimizes the uptake of the drug by normal cells and enhances the influx and retention of the drug in cancer cells. This delivery system includes three main components: (i) an apoptosis-inducing agent (anticancer drug), (ii) a targeting moiety-penetration enhancer, and (iii) a carrier. We describe one of the variants of such a system, which utilizes camptothecin as an apoptosis-inducing agent and poly(ethylene glycol) as a carrier. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was used as a targeting moiety (ligand) to LHRH receptors that are overexpressed in the plasma membrane of several types of cancer cells and are not expressed detectably in normal visceral organs. The results showed that the use of LHRH peptide as a targeting moiety in the anticancer DDS substantially enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy, led to amplified apoptosis induction in the tumor, and minimized the side effects of the anticancer drug on healthy organs. The LHRH receptor targeting DDS did not show in vivo pituitary toxicity and did not significantly influence the time course or the plasma concentration of luteinizing hormone and its physiological effects on the reproductive functions of mice.",M3
16121018,"[Present status of regenerative medical therapy and its potential in dentistry]A new medical therapy that clinically treats disease by making use of the potential of cells for proliferation and differentiation has been tried. To realize this medical therapy of cell-based tissue regeneration, or so-called regenerative medical therapy, it is indispensable to develop a biomedical technology or methodology of tissue engineering that enables cells to enhance their proliferation and differentiation, leading to induction of tissue regeneration. This paper overviews this tissue engineering (TE) and the present status of TE-based regenerative medical therapy. There are four fundamental technologies in TE: 1) the scaffolding for cell proliferation and differentiation, 2) the isolation and culturing of cells, 3) the drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) of growth factor, and 4) the maintenance of space to induce tissue regeneration. The TE technologies are briefly explained and concrete examples of in vitro and in vivo tissue regeneration induction are introduced. The collagen sponges of cell scaffold and gelatin hydrogels incorporating various growth factors for controlled release enabled the regeneration induction of various tissues. Tissue engineering of cell scaffolding and DDS technologies that provide cells with a local environment suitable to induce tissue regeneration, is important to realize regenerative medical therapy.",M3
16080900,"[Intraocular implantation of cyclosporine A drug delivery system in the treatment of experimental uveitis]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and safety of cyclosporine A drug delivery system (CsA <e>DDS</e>) implanted into vitreous cavity on the treatment of experimental rabbit uveitis. METHOD: A model of uveitis was established in 30 New Zealand white rabbits (30 eyes). The rabbits were randomized into control group (group A, 6 eyes), intravitreal non-medicated DDS group (group B, 6 eyes), oral CsA group (group C, 6 eyes) and intravitreal CsA DDS group (group D, 12 eyes). The inflammatory parameters such as floating cells, flaring and exudation in anterior chamber were graded. The cells infiltration and degree of opacity in vitreous were scored as well. The electroretinography and histopathological examination in eye, liver and kidney were recorded. In addition, CsA level in vitreous cavity was measured by HPLC in another 13 New Zealand white rabbits that received intravitreal implantation of CsA DDS. RESULTS: Uveitis was successfully induced in the 30 eyes. The inflammation in groups A, B and C was more severe than group D. There was no significant difference between groups D and A or B (P &lt; 0.05). The electroretinography showed more significant b-wave depression in groups A and B than group D (P &lt; 0.05). A large amount of inflammatory cells infiltration and marked tissue disorganization were found at ciliary body and retina in groups A and B. The mean drug level in vitreous cavity ws (491.0 +/- 481.6) ng/ml at 4 weeks, (575.2 +/-0373.2) ng/ml at 8 weeks and (301.5 +/- 128.5) ng/ml at 12 weeks. No toxicity could be detected in histological examination by light microscopy. CONCLUSION: Sustained therapeutic drug level could be achieved by implanting CsA DDS into vitreous cavity. It may effectively reduce the ocular inflammation in the rabbit model of uveitis.",M3
15866332,"Successful treatment of photo-damaged skin of nano-scale atRA particles using a novel transdermal delivery.We show a novel drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) for improved all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) therapy for external treatments of photo-damaged skin. We prepared inorganic-coated atRA nanoparticles, in turn an egg-like structure in nano-scale (Nano-atRA), using boundary-organized reaction droplets. The interfacial properties of organic architectures, in atRA micelles, were used to template the nucleation of inorganic minerals. As a result, irritation and inflammation associated with atRA therapy were substantially reduced due to the complete encapsulation of the carboxylic function. Both irritative symptoms and physicochemical instability of the atRA micelle were improved. Since Nano-atRA which is prepared following to this new DDS system developmentally improved the permeability to the stratum corneum, the remarkable pharmacological effects were resulted in comparison with atRA as such as follows: (1) thicker epidermis than classical atRA treatment and (2) the overexpression of mRNA for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) as the provocation epidermal hyperplasia. Furthermore, we found a surprising boost in production of hyaluronan (HA) among the intercellular spaces of the basal and spinous cell layers in epidermis. Nano-atRA technology for atRA therapy could not only efficiently regulate keratinocyte cell proliferation and differentiation, but also markedly produce the additional benefit. Severely injured human skin by chronic ultraviolet irradiation will completely repair due to the accelerated turnover of skin tissue, which is induced by Nano-atRA.",M3
15757482,"Antineovascular therapy, a novel antiangiogenic approach.Angiogenesis is a crucial event in tumour growth, since the growth of tumour cells depends on the supply of essentials such as oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, suppression of angiogenesis is expected to show potent therapeutic effects on various cancers. Additionally, this 'antiangiogenic therapy' is thought not only to eradicate primary tumour cells, but also suppress tumour metastases through disruption of haematogenous metastatic pathways. Tumour dormancy therapy does not aim to disrupt newly formed angiogenic vessels but aims to inhibit further formation of neovessels through inhibiting certain processes of angiogenesis. This raises a question of whether or not these antiangiogenic agents bring complete cure of tumours as complete cut-off of oxygen and nutrients is not expected by the treatment with these agents. This paper will review a novel antiangiogenic therapy, antineovascular therapy (ANET). ANET is categorised in antiangiogenic therapy but is different from tumour dormancy therapy using conventional angiogenic inhibitors: ANET aims to disrupt neovessels rather than to inhibit neovessel formation. ANET is based on the fact that angiogenic endothelial cells are growing cells and would be effectively damaged by cytotoxic agents when the agents are effectively delivered to the neovessels. The complete eradication of angiogenic endothelial cells may cause complete cut-off of essential supplies to the tumour cells and lead to indirect but strong cytotoxicity instead of cytostasis caused by the inhibition of angiogenesis. For the purpose of ANET, an angiogenic vasculature-targeting probe has been developed, by which cytotoxic anticancer agents are actively delivered to the angiogenic endothelial cells by using drug delivery system (<e>DDS</e>) technology. Another way to damage newly formed vessels by cytotoxic agents is achieved by metronomic-dosing chemotherapy. This chemotherapy shifts the target of chemotherapeutic agents from tumour cells to angiogenic endothelial cells by selective dosing schedule. Similarly, the shift of target from tumour cells to angiogenic endothelial cells enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cancer photo-dynamic therapy (PDT): in this antiangiogenic PDT, photosensitizers are delivered more to neovessel endothelial cells than to tumour cells. These therapeutic strategies would be clinically applied in the future.",M3
