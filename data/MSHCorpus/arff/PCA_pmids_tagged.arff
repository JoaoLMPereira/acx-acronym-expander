20537299,"Principal-component analysis for assessment of population stratification in mitochondrial medical genetics.Although inherited mitochondrial genetic variation can cause human disease, no validated methods exist for control of confounding due to mitochondrial population stratification (PS). We sought to identify a reliable method for PS assessment in mitochondrial medical genetics. We analyzed mitochondrial SNP data from 1513 European American individuals concomitantly genotyped with the use of a previously validated panel of 144 mitochondrial markers as well as the Affymetrix 6.0 (n = 432), Illumina 610-Quad (n = 458), or Illumina 660 (n = 623) platforms. Additional analyses were performed in 938 participants in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) (Illumina 650). We compared the following methods for controlling for PS: haplogroup-stratified analyses, mitochondrial principal-component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), and combined autosomal-mitochondrial PCA. We computed mitochondrial genomic inflation factors (mtGIFs) and test statistics for simulated case-control and continuous phenotypes (10,000 simulations each) with varying degrees of correlation with mitochondrial ancestry. Results were then compared across adjustment methods. We also calculated power for discovery of true associations under each method, using a simulation approach. Mitochondrial PCA recapitulated haplogroup information, but haplogroup-stratified analyses were inferior to mitochondrial PCA in controlling for PS. Correlation between nuclear and mitochondrial principal components (PCs) was very limited. Adjustment for nuclear PCs had no effect on mitochondrial analysis of simulated phenotypes. Mitochondrial PCA performed with the use of data from commercially available genome-wide arrays correlated strongly with PCA performed with the use of an exhaustive mitochondrial marker panel. Finally, we demonstrate, through simulation, no loss in power for detection of true associations with the use of mitochondrial PCA.",M1
20506827,"[NMR-spectroscopy-based metabonomic approach to analysis of Siwutang, a novel prescription, treated blood deficiency in mice]OBJECTIVE: To discover the characteristic changes of metabolic profiles in C57 mice with cyclophosphamide induced blood deficiency and the effect of Siwutang. METHOD: An integrated metabonomic study using high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the metabolic profiles of serum, aqueous and lipidic extracts of thoracic gland, spleen, bone marrow obtained from control, model group (intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg x kg(-1)) and Siwutang treated model group. The NMR spectra were integrated in segments of 0.04 ppm and then analyzed by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) using SIMCA-P software to visualize the similarities and differences in metabolic profiles between these groups. RESULT: PCA result showed conspicuous difference in the metabolic profiles between groups. Compared with the control group, the model group contained lower concentration of lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, choline, glucose, and higher concentration of VLDL/LDL, leucine/isoleucine in serum. Lower concentration of taurine choline, Fbeta:RCH2CH2CO, Epi-coprostanol and lactate were found in both in thoracic gland extracts and spleen extracts. And in spleen extracts, we also found the lower concentration of 3-HB. In the extracts of bone marrow, the lower concentration of lactate, choline, glucosee were observed. When they were dosed with Siwutang 10 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 7 days, the effects above-mentioned were reversed. CONCLUSION: The injury established by injecting CTX is a kind of proper model to develop further metabonomics researches. The damage of mitochondria, disorder of energy metabolism and osmoregulation are observed in cyclophosphamide caused blood deficiency model by NMR-based-metabonomics method, and the Siwutang can improve these effects.",M1
20450408,"Dimension reduction in human functioning and disability outcomes research: graphical models versus principal components analysis.PURPOSE: The complexity of rehabilitation outcomes in terms of functioning and disability leads to the need for dimension reduction in relation to specific research or clinical problems. Several statistical procedures are at hand. This article examines whether and to what extent principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and graphical models differ in the dimension reduction of data based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). METHODS: Using a data set of 1048 persons with spinal cord injury from 14 different countries as a case in point, this article compares the solutions in dimension reduction generated with a graphical model based on least average shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression on one hand and with a PCA on the other. RESULTS: Some factors extracted with the PCA properly match the clusters found with the graphical model, while in others less commonality can be found. In general, overlap ranges from 9 to 100% with 75% on average. Many of the discovered clusters or factors, i.e. dimensions, are compatible with the ICF structure, particularly in activity and participation. CONCLUSION: Functioning is a multidimensional, complex and dynamic outcome. We recommend being careful with dimension reduction based on statistical procedures alone. Theoretical considerations and clinical significance should always guide statistics. Stability of emergent dimensions that are compatible with theoretical or clinical considerations is a most important point. At least two different statistical procedures for dimension reduction, for instance PCA and LASSO regression, should be applied to conservatively select those dimensions that stay stable with both procedures.",M1
20416036,"Principal components analysis based control of a multi-DoF underactuated prosthetic hand.BACKGROUND: Functionality, controllability and cosmetics are the key issues to be addressed in order to accomplish a successful functional substitution of the human hand by means of a prosthesis. Not only the prosthesis should duplicate the human hand in shape, functionality, sensorization, perception and sense of body-belonging, but it should also be controlled as the natural one, in the most intuitive and undemanding way. At present, prosthetic hands are controlled by means of non-invasive interfaces based on electromyography (EMG). Driving a multi degrees of freedom (DoF) hand for achieving hand dexterity implies to selectively modulate many different EMG signals in order to make each joint move independently, and this could require significant cognitive effort to the user. METHODS: A Principal Components Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) based algorithm is used to drive a 16 DoFs underactuated prosthetic hand prototype (called CyberHand) with a two dimensional control input, in order to perform the three prehensile forms mostly used in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Such Principal Components set has been derived directly from the artificial hand by collecting its sensory data while performing 50 different grasps, and subsequently used for control. RESULTS: Trials have shown that two independent input signals can be successfully used to control the posture of a real robotic hand and that correct grasps (in terms of involved fingers, stability and posture) may be achieved. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a bio-inspired system successfully conjugating the advantages of an underactuated, anthropomorphic hand with a PCA-based control strategy, and opens up promising possibilities for the development of an intuitively controllable hand prosthesis.",M1
20411594,"Prediction of Parkinson's disease tremor onset using a radial basis function neural network based on particle swarm optimization.Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been successfully used throughout the world for the treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms. To control abnormal spontaneous electrical activity in target brain areas DBS utilizes a continuous stimulation signal. This continuous power draw means that its implanted battery power source needs to be replaced every 18-24 months. To prolong the life span of the battery, a technique to accurately recognize and predict the onset of the Parkinson's disease tremors in human subjects and thus implement an on-demand stimulator is discussed here. The approach is to use a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) with Local Field Potential (LFP) data recorded via the stimulation electrodes to predict activity related to tremor onset. To test this approach, LFPs from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) obtained through deep brain electrodes implanted in a Parkinson patient are used to train the network. To validate the network's performance, electromyographic (EMG) signals from the patient's forearm are recorded in parallel with the LFPs to accurately determine occurrences of tremor, and these are compared to the performance of the network. It has been found that detection accuracies of up to 89% are possible. Performance comparisons have also been made between a conventional RBFNN and an RBFNN based on PSO which show a marginal decrease in performance but with notable reduction in computational overhead.",M1
20403632,"EEG theta and alpha responses reveal qualitative differences in processing taxonomic versus thematic semantic relationships.Despite the importance of semantic relationships to our understanding of semantic knowledge, the nature of the neural processes underlying these abilities are not well understood. In order to investigate these processes, 20 healthy adults listened to thematically related (e.g., leash-dog), taxonomically related (e.g., horse-dog), or unrelated (e.g., desk-dog) noun pairs as their EEG was recorded. The data were analyzed using both event-related potentials (ERP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The spatiotemporal ERP and ERSP results were analyzed further with principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>). When comparing unrelated to related word pairs, the expected N400 effect was confirmed, as well as differences in theta and alpha oscillations. When comparing thematically and taxonomically related word pairs, the ERP revealed no significant differences, but the ERSP did. Specifically, theta power increased over right frontal areas for thematic versus taxonomic relationships and alpha power increased over parietal areas for taxonomic versus thematic relationships. The different oscillatory patterns over different brain regions suggest that thematic and taxonomic relationships engage distinct neural processes. Specifically, thematic relationships engage memory processes, while taxonomic relationships may require additional inhibitory or attention processes.",M1
20398334,"Integrative analysis of gene expression and copy number alterations using canonical correlation analysis.BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of new genetic measurement methods, several types of genetic alterations can be quantified in a high-throughput manner. While the initial focus has been on investigating each data set separately, there is an increasing interest in studying the correlation structure between two or more data sets. Multivariate methods based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed for integrating paired genetic data sets. The high dimensionality of microarray data imposes computational difficulties, which have been addressed for instance by studying the covariance structure of the data, or by reducing the number of variables prior to applying the CCA. In this work, we propose a new method for analyzing high-dimensional paired genetic data sets, which mainly emphasizes the correlation structure and still permits efficient application to very large data sets. The method is implemented by translating a regularized CCA to its dual form, where the computational complexity depends mainly on the number of samples instead of the number of variables. The optimal regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation. We apply the regularized dual CCA, as well as a classical CCA preceded by a dimension-reducing Principal Components Analysis (<e>PCA</e>), to a paired data set of gene expression changes and copy number alterations in leukemia. RESULTS: Using the correlation-maximizing methods, regularized dual CCA and PCA+CCA, we show that without pre-selection of known disease-relevant genes, and without using information about clinical class membership, an exploratory analysis singles out two patient groups, corresponding to well-known leukemia subtypes. Furthermore, the variables showing the highest relevance to the extracted features agree with previous biological knowledge concerning copy number alterations and gene expression changes in these subtypes. Finally, the correlation-maximizing methods are shown to yield results which are more biologically interpretable than those resulting from a covariance-maximizing method, and provide different insight compared to when each variable set is studied separately using PCA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that regularized dual CCA as well as PCA+CCA are useful methods for exploratory analysis of paired genetic data sets, and can be efficiently implemented also when the number of variables is very large.",M1
20397396,"Comparative study of microbial community structure in different filter media of constructed wetland.Comparisons of microbial community structure, in eight filter media of zeolites, anthracite, shale, vermiculite, ceramic filter media, gravel, steel slag and bio-ceramic, were undertaken by analyzing the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition. A total of 20 fatty acids in the range of C11 to C20 were determined but only 13 PLFAs were detected in steel slag. They consist of saturated fatty acids, branched fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The variation of fatty acids was revealed in the relative proportions of these fatty acids in different media. The aerobic prokaryotes were the predominant group in all media. The PLFA composition showed significant differences among the eight different media by Tukey's honestly test. It was found that steel slag was significantly different in the microbial community as compared to other filter media, probably due to its alkaline effluent. Steel slag alone is probably not a good choice of substratum in constructed wetlands. The principle components analysis (<e>PCA</e>) showed that zeolites, bio-ceramic, shale and vermiculite had a similar microbial community structure while steel slag and ceramic filter media were distinct from other media.",M1
20391592,"Rapid characterization of high/low producer CHO cells using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.An intact-cell mass spectrometry (ICM) method using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) was evaluated for the screening of stable recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, an important mammalian cell line in bioprocessing. With rapid and simple cell pretreatments, viabilities of cells could be rapidly distinguished on the different fingerprints of mass spectra. Detectable m/z values on cell surfaces and their relative intensities were processed by two biostatistical methods, principle components analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and partial least squares (PLS), with promising results. Discrimination among cell lines with different expressed recombinant proteins or different productivities could be achieved. The ICM method has the advantage of providing multiple parameters simultaneously and possesses the potential to become a powerful method for routine monitoring of bioprocesses.",M1
20390876,"Estimation of the lake water pollution by determination of 18 elements using ICP-MS method and their statistical analysis.Eighteen elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sr and Zn) were determined in water taken from Malta Lake. All the analyses were made using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method (ICP-MS). In our investigations we focused on the variability of the element content in water from a number of sampling stations and over different seasons. The obtained results were submitted to statistical analysis. First, the results were interpreted using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA). This has revealed differences in concentration for the majority of elements with regard to seasons. Then, cluster analysis (CA) and factor analysis (FA) were applied to explore similarities between sampling stations. Neither of these have demonstrated any grouping. Finally, factor analysis and principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), applied to show the grouping of elements, revealed how different sampling stations are related to each other.",M1
20389653,"Principal component analysis of dynamic fluorescence diffuse optical tomography images.Challenges remain in resolving drug distributions within small animals utilizing fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). In this paper, we present a new method for detecting and visualizing organs with different kinetics utilizing principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>). Indocynaine green (ICG) metabolic processes are simulated and imaged using FDOT. When applied to the time series of generated FDOT images, PCA provides a set of the principal components (PCs) which can represent spatial patterns associated with different kinetic behavior. Simulation and experiment studies are both performed to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results suggest that we are able to extract and illustrate changes in ICG kinetic behavior between the heart and the lungs.",M1
20383235,"Dietary patterns, approaches, and multicultural perspective.Nutrition research has traditionally focused on single nutrients in relation to health. However, recent appreciation of the complex synergistic interactions among nutrients and other food constituents has led to a growing interest in total dietary patterns. Methods of measurement include summation of food or nutrient recommendations met, such as the United States Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index; data-driven approaches--principal components (<e>PCA</e>) and cluster analyses--which describe actual intake patterns in the population; and, most recently, reduced rank regression, which defines linear combinations of food intakes that maximally explain intermediate markers of disease. PCA, a form of factor analysis, derives linear combinations of foods based on their intercorrelations. Cluster analysis groups individuals into maximally differing eating patterns. These approaches have now been used in diverse populations with good reproducibility. In contrast, because it is based on associations with outcomes rather than on coherent behavioral patterns, reduced rank regression may be less reproducible, but more research is needed. However, it is likely to yield useful information for hypothesis generation. Together, the focus on dietary patterns has been fruitful in demonstrating the powerful protective associations of healthy or prudent dietary patterns, and the higher risk associations of Western or meat and refined grains patterns. The field, however, has not fully addressed the effects of diet in subpopulations, including ethnic minorities. Depending on food group coding, subdietary patterns may be obscured or artificially separated, leading to potentially misleading results. Further attention to the definition of the dietary patterns of different populations is critical to providing meaningful results. Still, dietary pattern research has great potential for use in nutrition policy, particularly as it demonstrates the importance of total diet in health promotion.",M1
20375204,"Stomatal vs. genome size in angiosperms: the somatic tail wagging the genomic dog?BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Genome size is a function, and the product, of cell volume. As such it is contingent on ecological circumstance. The nature of 'this ecological circumstance' is, however, hotly debated. Here, we investigate for angiosperms whether stomatal size may be this 'missing link': the primary determinant of genome size. Stomata are crucial for photosynthesis and their size affects functional efficiency. METHODS: Stomatal and leaf characteristics were measured for 1442 species from Argentina, Iran, Spain and the UK and, using <e>PCA</e>, some emergent ecological and taxonomic patterns identified. Subsequently, an assessment of the relationship between genome-size values obtained from the Plant DNA C-values database and measurements of stomatal size was carried out. KEY RESULTS: Stomatal size is an ecologically important attribute. It varies with life-history (woody species &lt; herbaceous species &lt; vernal geophytes) and contributes to ecologically and physiologically important axes of leaf specialization. Moreover, it is positively correlated with genome size across a wide range of major taxa. CONCLUSIONS: Stomatal size predicts genome size within angiosperms. Correlation is not, however, proof of causality and here our interpretation is hampered by unexpected deficiencies in the scientific literature. Firstly, there are discrepancies between our own observations and established ideas about the ecological significance of stomatal size; very large stomata, theoretically facilitating photosynthesis in deep shade, were, in this study (and in other studies), primarily associated with vernal geophytes of unshaded habitats. Secondly, the lower size limit at which stomata can function efficiently, and the ecological circumstances under which these minute stomata might occur, have not been satisfactorally resolved. Thus, our hypothesis, that the optimization of stomatal size for functional efficiency is a major ecological determinant of genome size, remains unproven.",M1
20374842,"Effect of the addition of calcium soap to ewes' diet on fatty acid composition of ewe milk and subcutaneous fat of suckling lambs reared on ewe milk.The aim of this work was to study the effect of the inclusion of calcium soap (CS) in ewes' diet on the fatty acid profile of suckling lambs. Sixty suckling lambs of three breeds (Castellana, Churra and Assaf) were divided into two equal groups. One group was fed with a diet composed of beetroot pulp, alfalfa, barley, corn, soy, cotton and 4% of CS, and the other with a control diet without CS. The fatty acid profiles of the ewe's milk samples collected on the day before slaughter and of the lamb subcutaneous fat collected from the back of the carcasses were analysed. The addition of calcium soap to the ewe's diet did not change the milk fatty acid profile but significantly increased SFA and decreased both the PUFA and MUFA levels of suckling lamb fat. <e>PCA</e> analysis revealed a good separation of the lamb samples according to the diet of the mothers, showing that diet is more important than breed in explaining sample variability.",M1
20374795,"Sensory attributes that drive consumer acceptability of dry-cured ham and convergence with trained sensory data.The paper investigates the degree of convergence between trained panelists and consumers with regard to overall quality assessment and acceptability, respectively. In particular, the main sensory drivers used by both groups of assessors in their valuations, are investigated: first, a Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) is applied to identify main dimensions underlying sensory data, and second, the external preference mapping (PREFMAP) technique, that regress consumers' hedonic valuations on the PCA sensory dimensions, is applied. A total of eight samples of dry-cured ham was analysed by 14 trained panelists and 213 consumers in a northern city of Spain (Zaragoza). The results showed that both, consumers and trained panelists make use of the same sensory attributes to elicit their assessments, which are crumbliness, softness, flavour and sweetness. However, trained assessors are able to discriminate better the quality across ham samples, as we would expect, according to a higher degree of expertise. Interestingly, the PREFMAP technique showed a certain degree of heterogeneity in consumers' preferences, highlighting clusters with opposite liking trends.",M1

20345180,"Quantitative source apportionment of PAHs in sediments of Little Menomonee River, Wisconsin: weathered creosote versus urban background.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urban environments are often derived from point and nonpoint sources, the latter collectively considered as urban background. Quantifying the contributions of point sources and urban background is important for managing and remediating urban sediments. In this work, the sources of PAHs in 350 sediments from a 1.5-mile portion of the Little Menomonee River (Milwaukee, WI) were determined using principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), chemical fingerprinting, and positive matrix factorization (PMF), the combination of which mitigates weaknesses of any one method. At issue was quantifying the contributions of a creosote point-source formerly located 3.5 to 5.0 miles upstream versus urban background-derived PAHs in the sediments. In total, creosote and urban background contributed 27 and 73% (+/-14%) of eight carcinogenic PAHs (CPAHs), respectively, in this part of the River. The concentrations of CPAHs derived from urban background were highest in surface sediments (0-6 in.; 20 +/- 17 mg/kg), particularly near major roadway crossings, increased in the downstream direction, and (on average) exceeded the 15 mg/kg regulatory cleanup threshold. Weathered creosote-derived CPAHs were widespread at low concentrations (4.8 +/- 8.1 mg/kg) although some discrete sediments, mostly at depths below 6 in., contained elevated CPAHs derived from creosote. This work demonstrates the value of combining multiple techniques in source apportionment studies in urban sediments. It further demonstrates a means to determine the concentration of PAHs attributable to nonpoint sourced background in urban sediments without the need to identify, collect, and analyze (assumedly)  representative  background samples, which may not even exist in heterogeneous urban watersheds.",M1
20344949,"[Detection of pathogenic Vibrio by smartongue]OBJECTIVE: Electronic tongue is a modern analysis instrument and can detect very well the comprehensive information of liquid samples. Based on this, we employed the electronic tongue to detect the bacteria liquid culture, with the purpose of developing a new rapid method for the detection and identification of food-borne pathogens. METHODS: A novel voltammetric electronic tongue, smart tongue, was used to detect and differentiate 11 species of pathogenic Vibrio. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was used to extract the relevant information obtained by the smart tongue. From the data evaluation, the score plots of PCA were obtained. RESULTS: According to the plots, we chose the most feasible working electrodes at the most favorable frequency segments were determined for our purpose. The results showed that the best electrode arrays and frequency segments to differentiate pathogenic Vibrio were titanium electrode in 100 Hz, silver electrode in 100 Hz and tungsten electrode in 1 Hz and 10 Hz, respectively. We differentiated 11 species of pathogenic Vibrio independently in the score plot of tungsten electrode in 1 Hz. We also distinguished all the Vibrio with the combination of two of other three electrodes and frequencies. CONCLUSION: Smartongue could differentiate well 11 species of pathogenic Vibrio from the results analysed by PCA. It has a promising future as a novel modern rapid analytical technology for detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic Vibrio. The method and results could be a good stencil-plate to the research of detecting the other food-borne pathogens with smartongue, and good reference information for the further study.",M1

Finally, a generic procedure is suggested for optimization of HILIC analyses, depending on the ionization state of the analytes.",M1
20299814,"The Bern psychopathology scale for the assessment of system-specific psychotic symptoms.The translation from psychiatric core symptoms to brain functions and vice versa is a largely unresolved issue. In particular, the search for disorders of single brain regions explaining classical symptoms has not yielded the expected results. Based on the assumption that the psychopathology of psychosis is related to a functional imbalance of higher-order brain systems, the authors focused on three specific candidate brain circuitries, namely the language, and limbic and motor systems. These domains are of particular interest for understanding the disastrous communication breakdown during psychotic disorders. Core symptoms of psychosis were mapped on these domains by shaping their definitions in order to match the related brain functions. The resulting psychopathological assessment scale was tested for interrater reliability and internal consistency in a group of 168 psychotic patients. The items of the scale were reliable and a principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was best explained by a solution resembling the three candidate systems. Based on the results, the scale was optimized as an instrument to identify patient subgroups characterized by a prevailing dysfunction of one or more of these systems. In conclusion, the scale is apt to distinguish symptom domains related to the activity of defined brain systems. PCA showed a certain degree of independence of the system-specific symptom clusters within the patient group, indicating relative subgroups of psychosis. The scale is understood as a research instrument to investigate psychoses based on a system-oriented approach. Possible immediate advantages in the clinical application of the understanding of psychoses related to system-specific symptom domains are also discussed.",M1
20236682,"PCDD/Fs and PCBs in sediments of the Liaohe River, China: levels, distribution, and possible sources.The contamination status of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the surface sediments of the middle and lower reaches of the Liaohe River, which is one of the most heavily polluted rivers in China, were investigated. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were in the range of 0.24-27.49 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) (average value: 3.01 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1)) and 0.015-0.99 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) (average value: 0.33 WHO-TEQ kg(-1)), respectively. For most sediment samples, the pollution levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs exceeded the interim sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The highest level of PCDD/F contamination was found at the Tai'an reach of the Liaohe River, whereas the highest level of PCB contamination was found at the Xinmin reach of the Liaohe River. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data set of sediment samples and to source-related samples from the literature. The results suggested that, PCDD/F contamination in most sediments of the middle and lower reaches of the Daliao River should mainly originated from the local combustion processes, including coal burning, agricultural straw open burning, iron ore sintering, cement production and secondary Al and Cu metallurgy. For the PCBs, the major source was identified as the usage of technical PCB products, especially Chinese No. 1 PCB.",M1
20230047,"Immobilized antibody orientation analysis using secondary ion mass spectrometry and fluorescence imaging of affinity-generated patterns.This study assesses the capability of high-resolution surface analytical tools to distinguish immobilized antibody orientations on patterned surfaces designed for antibody affinity capture. High-fidelity, side-by-side copatterning of protein A (antibody Fc domain affinity reagent) and fluorescein (antibody Fab domain hapten) was achieved photolithographically on commercial amine-reactive hydrogel polymer surfaces. This was verified from fluorescence imaging using fluorescently labeled protein A and intrinsic fluorescence from fluorescein. Subsequently, dye-labeled murine antifluorescein antibody (4-4-20) and antibody Fab and Fc fragments were immobilized from solution onto respective protein A- and fluorescein- copatterned or control surfaces using antibody-ligand affinity interactions. Fluorescence assays support specific immobilization to fluorescein hapten- and protein A-patterned regions through antigen-antibody recognition and natural protein A-Fc domain interactions, respectively. Affinity-based antibody immobilization on the two different copatterned surfaces generated side-by-side full antibody  heads-up  and  tails-up  oriented surface patterns. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analysis, sensitive to chemical information from the top 2 to 3 nm of the surface, provided ion-specific images of these antibody patterned regions, imaging and distinguishing characteristic ions from amino acids enriched in Fab domains for antibodies oriented in  heads-up  regions, and ions from amino acids enriched in Fc domains for antibodies oriented in  tails-up  regions. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) improved the distinct TOF-SIMS amino acid compositional and ion-specific surface mapping sensitivity for each  heads-up  versus  tails-up  patterned region. Characteristic Fab and Fc fragment immobilized patterns served as controls. This provides first demonstration of pattern-specific, antibody orientation-dependent surface maps based on antibody domain- and structure-specific compositional differences by TOF-SIMS analysis. Since antibody immobilization and orientation are critical to many technologies, orientation characterization using TOF-SIMS could be very useful and convenient for immobilization quality control and understanding methods for improving the performance of antibody-based surface capture assays.",M1
20227609,"Influence of pasteurization, brining conditions and production environment on the microbiota of artisan Gouda-type cheeses.To monitor the effect of the indigenous milk microbiota and of technological and environmental parameters on the microbiota established in ripened cheese, the diversity and dynamics of the predominant microbial communities in artisan Gouda-type cheeses produced under different conditions was studied. A total of 22 cheese types differing in milk source, milk treatment, production environment and brining conditions were analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) using total DNA extracts as well as DNA extracted from culturable fractions. Through band position analysis and band sequencing, the majority of DGGE bands could be attributed to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), although a few bands also belonged to staphylococci and gamma-Proteobacteria. Aided by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), cheeses produced at different locations could clearly be differentiated. The same approach also allowed to distinguish raw and pasteurized milk cheeses, the former showing a more diverse microbiota in terms of a higher species richness and number of DGGE bands. No substantial differences were found between cheeses brined at two different locations. In conclusion, the combined PCR-DGGE approach relying on both total DNA extracts and culturable fractions proved its value for analyzing the effect of technological and environmental parameters on the diversity and dynamics of the microbiota in Gouda-type cheeses.",M1
20220583,"Syndromic association of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in Alzheimer disease and patient classification.OBJECTIVES: To identify patient groups with Alzheimer disease (AD) according to the presence of psychological and behavioral syndromes and to determine the clinical differences among these groups. METHODS: Cross-sectional and observational study of 491 patients with probable AD whom were administered the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at the baseline visit and reevaluated after 12 months. RESULTS: Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) of baseline NPI data revealed three factors, including a psychosis factor (delusions, hallucinations, and aberrant motor behavior), a depressive factor (depression, anxiety, irritability, agitation, and apathy) and a hypomanic factor (euphoria and disinhibition). Cluster analysis of factor scores indicated the presence of three patient groups: one group was characterized by low scores in factors, a second group including patients with high scores in the depressive factor, and a third group that included patients with high scores in the three factors. The PCA of the NPI scores carried out after 1 year showed the persistence of the three factors. The cluster analysis of their factor scores also showed the presence of the same three patient groups but with a few differences in certain symptoms. A higher frequency of personal psychiatric history but no family history was observed in the cluster with depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Three neuropsychiatric syndromes have been identified, which have made it possible to classify patients with AD in three distinct large groups. A temporal stability is evidenced among the group with low symptoms. Patients with high scores in depressive factor or in three factors showed greater temporal instability. Certain differences among the groups suggest that different physiopathogenic mechanisms may be involved in neuropsychiatric syndromes.",M1
20210483,"Discrimination analysis of human lung cancer cells associated with histological type and malignancy using Raman spectroscopy.The Raman spectroscopic technique enables the observation of intracellular molecules without fixation or labeling procedures in situ. Raman spectroscopy is a promising technology for diagnosing cancers-especially lung cancer, one of the most common cancers in humans-and other diseases. The purpose of this study was to find an effective marker for the identification of cancer cells and their malignancy using Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate a classification of cultured human lung cancer cells using Raman spectroscopy, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), and linear discrimination analysis (LDA). Raman spectra of single, normal lung cells, along with four cancer cells with different pathological types, were successfully obtained with an excitation laser at 532 nm. The strong appearance of bands due to cytochrome c (cyt-c) indicates that spectra are resonant and enhanced via the Q-band near 550 nm with excitation light. The PCA loading plot suggests a large contribution of cyt-c in discriminating normal cells from cancer cells. The PCA results reflect the nature of the original cancer, such as its histological type and malignancy. The five cells were successfully discriminated by the LDA.",M1
20207394,"Inferences over the sources and processes affecting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the atmosphere derived from measured data.Data concerning atmospheric lifetime and relative source contributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are fragmentary and contradictory. In this study, two datasets of measurements of atmospheric PAH (sum of particulate and gaseous phases), one from a national network, the other from a more local three-site study, were analysed and used to infer processes affecting PAH in the atmosphere, and their sources. PAH congener profiles measured at urban and rural locations were remarkably similar suggesting that atmospheric decay processes are relatively slow. This allows the use of such profiles to elucidate sources. A spatial analysis of two PAH datasets showed a clear influence of industry and road traffic upon local PAH concentrations. When Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was applied to UK national network data, it showed a clear influence of steel industry emissions and of home heating emissions from coal and oil in Northern Ireland. These sites also showed different winter/summer concentration ratios to the main group of sites. In the data from Birmingham (UK), PCA identified separate factors relating to gasoline and diesel vehicles, as well as the influence of wood combustion on  Bonfire night , and a factor related to home heating emissions which shows up only in the cold season.",M1
20199987,"Hypovitaminosis D and K are highly prevalent and independent of overall malnutrition in the institutionalized elderly.There have been methodological problems for studying hypovitaminosis D and K in the elderly. First, studies were done either by evaluating food intake or measuring their circulating levels, but rarely by both in Japan. In this paper, vitamin D and K intakes and their circulating levels were simultaneously determined. Second issue is whether hypovitaminosis D and K are independent of general malnutrition, prevalent in the elderly. We tried to statistically discriminate them by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>). Fifty institutionalized elderly were evaluated for their circulating 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25OH-D), intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), phylloquinone (PK), menaquinone-7 (MK-7) levels, and their food intake. Although average vitamin D intake (7.0 microg/day) exceeded the Japanese Adequate Intake (AI) of 5.0 microg/day, average serum 25OH-D concentration was in the hypovitaminosis D range (11.1 ng/mL). Median vitamin K intake was 168 microg/day, approximately 2.5 times as high as AI for vitamin K. Nevertheless, plasma PK and MK-7 concentrations were far lower than those of healthy Japanese elderly over 70 years old. PCA yielded four components; each representing overall nutritional, vitamin K2, vitamin D, and vitamin K1 status, respectively. Since these components are independent of each other, vitamin D- and K-deficiency in these subjects could not be explained by overall malnutrition alone. In summary, institutionalized elderly had a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and K, and the simultaneous determination of their circulating level and dietary intake is mandatory in such studies. PCA would yield fruitful results for eliminating the interference by confounders in a cross-sectional study.",M1
20122180,"Nonnegative principal component analysis for mass spectral serum profiles and biomarker discovery.BACKGROUND: As a novel cancer diagnostic paradigm, mass spectroscopic serum proteomic pattern diagnostics was reported superior to the conventional serologic cancer biomarkers. However, its clinical use is not fully validated yet. An important factor to prevent this young technology to become a mainstream cancer diagnostic paradigm is that robustly identifying cancer molecular patterns from high-dimensional protein expression data is still a challenge in machine learning and oncology research. As a well-established dimension reduction technique, <e>PCA</e> is widely integrated in pattern recognition analysis to discover cancer molecular patterns. However, its global feature selection mechanism prevents it from capturing local features. This may lead to difficulty in achieving high-performance proteomic pattern discovery, because only features interpreting global data behavior are used to train a learning machine. METHODS: In this study, we develop a nonnegative principal component analysis algorithm and present a nonnegative principal component analysis based support vector machine algorithm with sparse coding to conduct a high-performance proteomic pattern classification. Moreover, we also propose a nonnegative principal component analysis based filter-wrapper biomarker capturing algorithm for mass spectral serum profiles. RESULTS: We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparison with six peer algorithms on four benchmark datasets. Moreover, we illustrate that nonnegative principal component analysis can be effectively used to capture meaningful biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that nonnegative principal component analysis effectively conduct local feature selection for mass spectral profiles and contribute to improving sensitivities and specificities in the following classification, and meaningful biomarker discovery.",M1
20196748,"Comparing spatial maps of human population-genetic variation using Procrustes analysis.Recent applications of principal components analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) in human population genetics have found that  statistical maps  based on the genotypes in population-genetic samples often resemble geographic maps of the underlying sampling locations. To provide formal tests of these qualitative observations, we describe a Procrustes analysis approach for quantitatively assessing the similarity of population-genetic and geographic maps. We confirm in two scenarios, one using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from Europe and one using SNP data worldwide, that a measurably high level of concordance exists between statistical maps of population-genetic variation and geographic maps of sampling locations. Two other examples illustrate the versatility of the Procrustes approach in population-genetic applications, verifying the concordance of SNP analyses using PCA and MDS, and showing that statistical maps of worldwide copy-number variants (CNVs) accord with statistical maps of SNP variation, especially when CNV analysis is limited to samples with the highest-quality data. As statistical maps with PCA and MDS have become increasingly common for use in summarizing population relationships, our examples highlight the potential of Procrustes-based quantitative comparisons for interpreting the results in these maps.",M1
20196565,"Effect of cefazolin treatment on the nonresonant Raman signatures of the metabolic state of individual Escherichia coli cells.Laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) was used to characterize the Raman fingerprints of the metabolic states of Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and to determine the spectral changes associated with cellular response to the antibiotic Cefazolin. The Raman spectra of E. coli cells sampled at different time points in the bacterial growth curve exhibited several spectral features that enabled direct identification of the growth phase of the bacteria. Four groups of Raman peaks were identified based on similarities in the time-dependent behavior of their intensities over the course of the growth curve. These groupings were also consistent with the different biochemical species represented by the Raman peaks. Raman peaks associated with DNA and RNA displayed a decrease in intensity over time, while protein-specific Raman vibrations increased at different rates. The adenine ring-breathing mode at 729 and the 1245 cm(-1) vibration peaked in intensity within the first 10 h and decreased afterward. Application of principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) to the Raman spectra enabled accurate identification of the different metabolic states of the bacterial cells. The Raman spectra of cells exposed to Cefazolin at the end of log phase exhibited a different behavior. The 729 and 1245 cm(-1) Raman peaks showed a slight decrease in intensity from 4 to 10 h after inoculation. Moreover, a shift in the spectral position of the adenine ring-breathing mode from 724 to 729 cm(-1), which was observed during normal bacterial growth, was inhibited during antibiotic drug treatment. These results suggest that potential Raman markers exist that can be used to identify E. coli cell response to antibiotic drug treatment.",M1
20188937,"Application of a potentiometric sensor array as a technique in sensory analysis.This paper reports on the application of a potentiometric sensor array used for monitoring changes in probiotic fermented milk during storage, classification of probiotic fermented milk according to flavor and to accurately predict the results from a human sensory panel. For that purpose the potentiometric electronic tongue consisting of seven sensors and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used. The samples of plain, strawberry, apple-pear and forest-fruit probiotic fermented milk were stored during 20 days on two different temperatures and monitored by the electronic tongue and the human sensory panel. Various pattern recognition techniques are adapted including multivariate data processing based on principal components analysis (<e>PCA</e>) for monitoring changes occurring in probiotic fermented milk, artificial neural networks (ANN) for the classification of probiotic fermented milk during storage, partial least square regression (PLS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate and predict the sensory panel evaluation results. The highest correct classification percentage (97%) was obtained for plain probiotic fermented milk and the lowest (87%) for apple-pear flavored probiotic fermented milk. The highest correlation between the sensor array and the human sensory panel was obtained for the forest-fruit flavored probiotic fermented milk both by using artificial neural networks (0.998) and partial least square regression (0.992). Results from these analyses demonstrate that the electronic tongue can be used to monitor changes in probiotic fermented milk during storage, to classify probiotic fermented milk according to flavor and to predict the sensory characteristics and their relationship to the quality of the probiotic fermented milk measured by consumer.",M1
20188918,"Analysis of protein chromatographic profiles joint to partial least squares to detect adulterations in milk mixtures and cheeses.To prevent possible frauds and give more protection to companies and consumers it is necessary to control that the types of milk used in the elaboration of dairy products correspond to those appearing in their label. Therefore, it is greatly interesting to have efficient, quick and cheap methods of analysis to identify them. In the present work, the multivariate data are the protein chromatographic profiles of cheese and milk extracts, obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). These data correspond to pure samples of bovine, ovine and caprine milk, and also to binary and ternary mixtures. The structure of the data is studied through principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), whereas the percentage of each kind of milk has been determined by a partial least squares (PLS) calibration model. In cheese elaborated with mixtures of milk, the procedure employed allows one to detect 3.92, 2.81 and 1.47% of ovine, caprine and bovine milk, respectively, when the probability of false non-compliance is fixed at 0.05. These percentages reach 7.72, 5.52 and 2.89%, respectively, when both the probability of false non-compliance and false compliance are fixed at 0.05.",M1
20184035,"Chemotypes of Pistacia atlantica leaf essential oils from Algeria.The essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of Pistacia atlantica Desf. leaves collected from different regions of Algeria were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The essential oil was rich in monoterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The major components were alpha-pinene (0.0-67%), delta-3-carene (0.0-56%), spathulenol (0.5-22%), camphene (0.0-21%), terpinen-4-ol (0.0-16%) and beta-pinene (0.0-13%). Among the various components identified, twenty were used for statistical analyses. The result of principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) showed the occurrence of three chemotypes: a delta-3-carene chemotype (16.4-56.2%), a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (10.8-16.0%) and an alpha-pinene/camphene chemotype (10.9-66.6%/3.8-20.9%). It was found that the essential oil from female plants (delta-3-carene chemotype) could be easily differentiated from the two other chemotypes corresponding to male trees.",M1
20183500,"Test of the relationships between the content of heavy metals in sewage sludge and source of their pollution by chemometric methods.The content of various metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in sewage sludge was analysed by ICP-OES technique. The study was performed on 14 samples from the Wielkopolska region and 4 from the neighbouring provinces. The results were used to perform chemometric analysis. Two chemometric methods were used to test the relationships between the content of heavy metals in sewage sludge and the sources of their pollution. The application of cluster analysis displayed important information about the identification of similar locations of sewage sludge sampling stations. This chemometric method showed that all the monitoring locations are grouped into three main clusters. Separated clusters present similarities between locations of the sewage treatment plants, which have the same kind of industrial plants in their catchment area. Principal component analysis enabled interpretation of the complex relationships between determined elements. Application of principal component analysis to the whole data set helped to distinguish only two sewage sludge stations (Ostrow Wlkp. and Poznan-Kozieglowy) that could be interpreted, each in different principal component thereby suggesting that element's concentration differ considerably. The interpretation of relationships between the rest of the stations was possible by performing <e>PCA</e> for the second time, but on the reduced data set (two above-mentioned stations were excluded). It distinguished two groups: (1) Gniezno, Srem, Kalisz, Inowrocław and Sroda Wlkp, and (2) Gostyn, Gniezno and Kalisz, which differ with regard to element's concentration.",M1
20181231,"The IGF1 small dog haplotype is derived from Middle Eastern grey wolves.BACKGROUND: A selective sweep containing the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene is associated with size variation in domestic dogs. Intron 2 of IGF1 contains a SINE element and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in all small dog breeds that is almost entirely absent from large breeds. In this study, we surveyed a large sample of grey wolf populations to better understand the ancestral pattern of variation at IGF1 with a particular focus on the distribution of the small dog haplotype and its relationship to the origin of the dog. RESULTS: We present DNA sequence data that confirms the absence of the derived small SNP allele in the intron 2 region of IGF1 in a large sample of grey wolves and further establishes the absence of a small dog associated SINE element in all wild canids and most large dog breeds. Grey wolf haplotypes from the Middle East have higher nucleotide diversity suggesting an origin there. Additionally, <e>PCA</e> and phylogenetic analyses suggests a closer kinship of the small domestic dog IGF1 haplotype with those from Middle Eastern grey wolves. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of both the SINE element and SNP allele in grey wolves suggests that the mutation for small body size post-dates the domestication of dogs. However, because all small dogs possess these diagnostic mutations, the mutations likely arose early in the history of domestic dogs. Our results show that the small dog haplotype is closely related to those in Middle Eastern wolves and is consistent with an ancient origin of the small dog haplotype there. Thus, in concordance with past archeological studies, our molecular analysis is consistent with the early evolution of small size in dogs from the Middle East.See associated opinion by Driscoll and Macdonald: http://jbiol.com/content/9/2/10.",M1
20180550,"Temporal variations of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxin and methoxylated diphenyl ether concentrations in fish revealing large differences in exposure and metabolic stability.The concentrations of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) and polybrominated methoxylated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) were investigated in perch (Perca fluviatilis) collected from a Baltic Sea background contaminated area between 1990 and 2005. No temporal trend was found, but large variations were observed - up to 5-fold and 160-fold differences in MeO-PBDE and PBDD concentrations, respectively - between consecutive years, suggesting that retention of these compounds, particularly the PBDDs, is limited. Examination of the congener profiles using principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and correlation analysis indicated that MeO-PBDEs without adjacent substituents (6-MeO-BDE47) or with two adjacent substituents (2'-MeO-BDE68 and 6-MeO-BDE90) are retained more than MeO-PBDEs with three adjacent substituents (6-MeO-BDE85 and 6-MeO-BDE99) and that 1,3,6,8-tetraBDD and 1,3,7,9-tetraBDD are retained more than the other PBDDs which have vicinal hydrogen. Debromination could explain the limited retention of 6-MeO-PBDE85 and 6-MeO-BDE99 and the absence of 2-MeO-BDE123 and 6-MeO-BDE137, and cytochrome P-450 mediated oxidation could explain the limited retention of PBDDs containing vicinal hydrogen. The levels of organobromines, especially MeO-PBDEs, were found to covary with water conditions related to primary production, for example temperature, depth visibility, and inorganic nutrient concentrations, which also favor fish productivity. The results suggest natural production of MeO-PBDEs and PBDDs and imply that they fluctuate considerably over time, as do common marine toxins in fish. Thus, assessments of human and environmental risk should consider both the average and peak concentrations of these contaminants in marine biota.",M1
20177391,"Principal component analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in human prostate cancer.OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a fast, objective and standardized method for image processing of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI of the prostate based on principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional internal review board; signed informed consent was obtained. MRI of the prostate at 3 Tesla was performed in 21 patients with biopsy proven cancers before radical prostatectomy. Seven 3-dimensional gradient echo datesets, 2 pre and 5 post-gadopentetate dimeglumine injection (0.1 mmol/kg), were acquired within 10.5 minutes at high spatial resolution. PCA of dynamic intensity-scaled (IS) and enhancement-scaled (ES) datasets and analysis by the 3-time points (3TP) method were applied using the latter method for adjusting the PCA eigenvectors. RESULTS: PCA of 7 IS datasets and 6 ES datasets yielded their corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The first IS-eigenvector captured the major part of the signal variance because of a signal change between the precontrast and the first postcontrast arising from the inhomogeneous surface coil reception profile. The next 2 IS-eigenvectors and the 2 dominant ES-eigenvectors captured signal changes because of tissue contrast-enhancement, whereas the remaining eigenvectors captured noise changes. These eigenvectors were adjusted by rotation to reach congruence with the wash-in and wash-out kinetic parameters defined according to the 3TP method. The IS and ES-eigenvectors and rotation angles were highly reproducible across patients enabling the calculation of a general rotated eigenvector base that served to rapidly and objectively calculate diagnostically relevant projection coefficient maps for new cases. We found for the a priori selected prostate cancer patients that the projection coefficients of the IS-2nd eigenvector provided a higher accuracy for detecting biopsy proven cancers (94% sensitivity, 67% specificity, 80% ppv, and 89% npv) than the projection coefficients of the ES-2nd rotated and non rotated eigenvectors. CONCLUSIONS: PCA adjusted to correlate with physiological parameters selects a dominant eigenvector, free of the inhomogeneous radio-frequency field reception-profile and noise-components. Projection coefficient maps of this eigenvector provide a fast, objective, and standardized means for visualizing prostate cancer.",M1
20172102,"Combination of an e-nose, an e-tongue and an e-eye for the characterisation of olive oils with different degree of bitterness.An electronic panel has been used to characterise the organoleptic characteristics of twenty-five extra virgin olive oils from varieties Hojiblanca, Picual and Arbequina, with different degree of bitterness. The method consists in the combination of three systems: electronic nose, electronic tongue and electronic eye. The Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>), where PC1, PC2 and PC3 explained 59% of the total variance between the samples, has demonstrated that the capability of discrimination of the combined system is superior to that obtained with the three instruments separately. This improvement is due to the increased information extracted from each sample. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) has allowed separation of the groups in function of olive variety with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) lower than 0.099. Using PLS1 and PLS2 regression models, good correlations have been found between the signals obtained from the electronic tongue and the polyphenolic content (measured by chromatographic methods) or the bitterness index (scored by a panel of experts) with correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 in calibration and validation. These preliminary results indicate that the combination of an e-nose, an e-tongue and an e-eye can be a useful tool for the analysis of olive oil bitterness.",M1
20171809,"Optimization of collimator trajectory in volumetric modulated arc therapy: development and evaluation for paraspinal SBRT.PURPOSE: To develop a collimator trajectory optimization paradigm for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and evaluate this technique in paraspinal stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). METHOD AND MATERIALS: We propose a novel VMAT paradigm, Coll-VMAT, which integrates collimator rotation with synchronized gantry rotation, multileaf collimator (MLC) motion, and dose-rate modulation. At each gantry angle a principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) is applied to calculate the primary cord orientation. The collimator angle is then aligned so that MLC travel is parallel to the PCA-derived direction. An in-house VMAT optimization follows the geometry-based collimator trajectory optimization to obtain the optimal MLC position and monitor units (MU) at each gantry angle. A treatment planning study of five paraspinal SBRT patients compared Coll-VMAT to standard VMAT (fixed collimator angle) and static field IMRT plans. Plan evaluation statistics included planning target volume (PTV) V95%, PTV-D95%, cord-D05%, and total beam-on time. RESULTS: Variation of collimator angle in Coll-VMAT plans ranges from 26 degrees to 54 degrees , with a median of 40 degrees . Patient-averaged PTV V95% (94.6% Coll-VMAT vs. 92.1% VMAT and 93.3% IMRT) and D95% (22.5 Gy vs. 21.4 Gy and 22.0 Gy, respectively) are highest with Coll-VMAT, and cord D05% (9.8 Gy vs. 10.0 Gy and 11.7 Gy) is lowest. Total beam-on time with Coll-VMAT (5,164 MU) is comparable to standard VMAT (4,868 MU) and substantially lower than IMRT (13,283 MU). CONCLUSION: Collimator trajectory optimization-based VMAT provides an additional degree of freedom that can improve target coverage and cord sparing of paraspinal SBRT plans compared with standard VMAT and IMRT approaches.",M1
20171312,"Feature extraction and selection from volatile compounds for analytical classification of Chinese red wines from different varieties.This work was undertaken to evaluate whether it is possible to determine the variety of a Chinese wine on the basis of its volatile compounds, and to investigate if discrimination models could be developed with the experimental wines that could be used for the commercial ones. A headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatographic (HS-SPME-GC) procedure was used to determine the volatile compounds and a blind analysis based on Ac/Ais (peak area of volatile compound/peak area of internal standard) was carried out for statistical purposes. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) were used to process data and to develop discriminant models. Only 11 peaks enabled to differentiate and classify the experimental wines. SLDA allowed 100% recognition ability for three grape varieties, 100% prediction ability for Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Gernischt wines, but only 92.31% for Merlot wines. A more valid and robust way was to use the PCA scores to do the discriminant analysis. When we performed SLDA this way, 100% recognition ability and 100% prediction ability were obtained. At last, 11 peaks which selected by SLDA from raw analysis set had been identified. When we demonstrated the models using commercial wines, the models showed 100% recognition ability for the wines collected directly from winery and without ageing, but only 65% for the others. Therefore, the varietal factor was currently discredited as a differentiating parameter for commercial wines in China. Nevertheless, this method could be applied as a screening tool and as a complement to other methods for grape base liquors which do not need ageing and blending procedures.",M1
20170986,"Assessing the chemical diversity of an hsp90 database.The 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) has emerged as a new, promising target for cancer drug discovery. With the simultaneous disruption of a large range of oncogenic pathways, hsp90 inhibition results in either cytostasis or cell death. Diverse inhibitors of this molecular chaperone are currently under intensive study, and several have reached clinical trials. In the present work, patented and published structure-activity relationships on hsp90 inhibitors were organised in a database format that associates chemical structures with their biological activities. This hsp90 database contains 814 unique structures and, to our knowledge, is the most complete ever reported. With the aim to provide a general overview and evaluation of the chemical diversity of the ligands included in the dataset, a two-dimensional analysis was performed. A set of twenty-five topological molecular descriptors was calculated, allowing the emphasis of those that have higher importance for hsp90 active compounds, and for the three chemical scaffold families, geldanamycins, purines and pyrazole-isoxazoles. We have used a principal-component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) computational approach to analyse the 2D descriptor space of active and non-active hsp90 ligands. Furthermore, a fragment-based study highlighted the most frequently moieties represented in the active purine and pyrazole-isoxazole derivatives that are likely to be responsible for the observed biological activities.",M1
20169759,"Application of functional principal component analysis in race walking: an emerging methodology.This study considered the problem of identifying and evaluating the factors of individual performance during race walking. In particular, the study explored the use of functional principal component analysis (f-<e>PCA</e>), a multivariate data analysis, for assessing and classifying the kinematics and kinetics of the knee joint in competitive race walkers. Seven race walkers of international and national level participated to the study. An optoelectronic system and a force platform were used to capture three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics of lower limbs during the race walking cycle. Functional principal component analysis was applied bilaterally to the sagittal knee angle and net moment data, because knee joint motion is fundamental to race walking technique. Scatterplots of principal component scores provided evidence of athletes' technical differences and asymmetries even when traditional analysis (mean +/- s curves) was not effective. Principal components provided indications for race walkers' classification and identified potentially important technical differences between higher and lower skilled athletes. Therefore, f-PCA might represent a future aid for the fine analysis of sports movements, if consistently applied to performance monitoring.",M1
20167349,"Seasonal variations of sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to a northeastern urban city, China.Understanding the seasonal variations of sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air in urban region is important to the effective control of air pollution in the region. Based on a year round dataset (from August 2008 to July 2009), the sources of atmospheric PAHs in Harbin, a typical Chinese northeastern urban city, were analyzed by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The average total (gas plus particulate) PAH concentration varied from 6.3 ng m(-3) to 340 ng m(-3) with a mean of 100+/-94 ng m(-3), with higher concentrations in heating season than those in non-heating season. PCA and PMF identified similar source factors to atmospheric PAHs with obvious seasonal variation. The results obtained by PMF method indicated that the main sources were coal-fired boiler (39%), diesel engine (34%) and coal average (22%) in heating season and traffic emissions (59%), ground evaporation (18%) and coal average (17%) in non-heating season. Excellent correlation coefficients between predicted and measured concentrations of PAHs indicated that PMF was a useful model for source apportionment of PAHs in atmosphere.",M1
20164610,"Development and quality analysis of the Work Experience Measurement Scale (WEMS).Instruments related to work are commonly illuminated from an ill-health perspective. The need for a concise and useable instrument in workplace health promotion governed the aim of this paper which is to present the development process and quality assessment of the Work Experience Measurement Scale (WEMS). A survey, using a questionnaire based on established theories regarding work and health, and a focus group study were performed in hospital settings in 2005 and 2006 respectively. A Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was used to statistically develop a model, and focus group interviews were made to compare quantitative and qualitative results for convergence and corroboration. The PCA resulted in a six factor model of dimensions containing items regarding management, reorganization, internal work experience, pressure of time, autonomy and supportive working conditions. In the analysis of the focus group study three themes appeared and their underlying content was compared to, and matched, with the dimensions of the PCA. The reliability, shown by weighted kappa values, ranged from 0.36 to 0.71, and adequate Cronbach's Alpha values of the dimensions were all above 0.7. The study validity, indicated by discriminant validity, with correlation values that ranged from 0.10 to 0.39, in relation to the content validity appeared to be good when the theoretical content of the WEMS was compared to the content of similar instruments. The WEMS presents a multidimensional picture of work experience. Its theoretical base and the psychometric properties give support for applicability and offer a possibility to measure trends in the work experience over time in health care settings. One intention of the WEMS is to stimulate the ability of organizations and the employees themselves to take action on improving their work experience. The conciseness of the instrument is intended to increase its usability.",M1
20153225,"Why pyridine containing pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones selectively inhibit CDK4 than CDK2: insights from molecular dynamics simulation.Designing selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitors is an area of intense research to develop potential anticancer drugs. The molecular basis governing the selective inhibition of CDK4 by lig17 (6-bromo-8-cyclopentyl-2-(5-piperazin-1-yl-pyridin-2-ylamino)-8H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one) has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. The positive charge on the ligand was determined to be an important contributor for CDK4 selectivity due to the electronegative nature of its active site. Similar studies on CDK2 indicated that Lys89 intrudes into the active site displacing the positive charge on lig17 away from the active center. This intrusion was observed to propel a drastic conformational change in lig17, weakening its binding interactions with the protein. The pyridine nitrogen (N(AR)) of lig17 was capable of interacting with His95 (CDK4) through hydrogen bonding. N(AR) also showed a strong tendency to mediate protein-ligand interactions through a bridged water molecule, only when bound to CDK4. The G-loop of CDK4 was observed to fluctuate extensively when complexed with lig17 and a novel  flipping-out  mechanism exhibited by Tyr17(CDK4/CDK4-17) is reported in this study. Although these proteins have similar folds, the results from principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) indicate that CDK4 and CDK2 follow an anti-correlated behavior towards the accessibility of the active site.",M1
20151648,"Influence of the input system (conventional versus organic farming) on metabolite profiles of maize ( Zea mays ) kernels.Maize ( Zea mays ) kernels grown conventionally and organically, respectively, were investigated using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolite profiling methodology. By analysis of three cultivars grown at two locations with different input systems and at a third location where both organic and conventional farming were applied, the impact of the growing regime on the metabolite spectrum should be put into the context of natural variability. The applied analytical approach involved consecutive extraction of freeze-dried maize flour and subsequent subfractionation. Approximately 300 compounds from a broad spectrum of chemical classes were detected, of which 167 were identified. The metabolite profiling data were statistically assessed via principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The PCA demonstrated that the observed separations were mainly due to genetic differences (cultivars) and environmental influences. The different input systems (conventional/organic) only led to minor differentiations. ANOVA and quantification of selected constituents confirmed these observations.

This study investigated the effects of the menstrual cycle on (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) derived metabolomic profiles of urine and plasma from healthy women. METHODS: In this study, 34 healthy women were recruited and a first void urine and fasting blood sample were collected from each woman at four different time points during one menstrual cycle. Serum hormone levels were used in combination with the menstrual calendar to classify the urine and plasma samples into five different phases i.e. menstrual, follicular, periovulatory, luteal and premenstrual. The urine and plasma samples were analysed using (1)H NMR spectroscopy and subsequent data were analysed using principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and partial least squares discriminant analysis. RESULTS: PCA of the urine spectra showed no separation of samples based on the phases of the menstrual cycle. Multivariate analysis of the plasma spectra showed a separation of the menstrual phase and the luteal phase samples (R(2) = 0.61, Q(2) = 0.41). Subsequent analysis revealed a significant decrease in levels of glutamine, glycine, alanine, lysine, serine and creatinine and a significant increase in levels of acetoacetate and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL CH(2)) during the luteal phase. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish a need to control for metabolic changes that occur in plasma due to the menstrual cycle in the design of future metabolomic studies involving premenopausal women.",M1
20149094,"Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms reveal population history and adaptive divergence in wild guppies.Adaptation of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to contrasting upland and lowland habitats has been extensively studied with respect to behaviour, morphology and life history traits. Yet population history has not been studied at the whole-genome level. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of variation in many genomes and consequently very informative for a genome-wide picture of standing natural variation in populations, genome-wide SNP data are rarely available for wild vertebrates. Here we use genetically mapped SNP markers to comprehensively survey genetic variation within and among naturally occurring guppy populations from a wide geographic range in Trinidad and Venezuela. Results from three different clustering methods, Neighbor-net, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and Bayesian analysis show that the population substructure agrees with geographic separation and largely with previously hypothesized patterns of historical colonization. Within major drainages (Caroni, Oropouche and Northern), populations are genetically similar, but those in different geographic regions are highly divergent from one another, with some indications of ancient shared polymorphisms. Clear genomic signatures of a previous introduction experiment were seen, and we detected additional potential admixture events. Headwater populations were significantly less heterozygous than downstream populations. Pairwise F(ST) values revealed marked differences in allele frequencies among populations from different regions, and also among populations within the same region. F(ST) outlier methods indicated some regions of the genome as being under directional selection. Overall, this study demonstrates the power of a genome-wide SNP data set to inform for studies on natural variation, adaptation and evolution of wild populations.",M1
20148367,"Trans fatty acids in human milk are an indicator of different maternal dietary sources containing trans fatty acids.The trans fatty acid (TFA) patterns in the fats of ruminant meat and dairy products differ from those found in other (processed) fats. We have evaluated different TFA isomers in human breast milk as an indicator of dietary intake of ruminant and dairy fats of different origins. Breast milk samples were collected 1 month postpartum from 310 mothers participating in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (The Netherlands). The study participants had different lifestyles and consumed different amounts of dairy products. Fatty acid methyl esters were determined by GC-FID and the data were evaluated by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), ANOVA/Post Hoc test and linear regression analysis. The two major principal components were (1) 18:1 trans-isomers and (2) markers of dairy fat including 15:0, 17:0, 11(trans)18:1 and 9(cis),11(trans)18:2 (CLA). Despite similar total TFA values, the 9(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio and the 10(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio were significantly lower in milk from mothers with high dairy fat intake (40-76 g/day: 0.91 +/- 0.48, P &lt; 0.05) compared to low dairy fat intake (0-10 g/day: 1.59 +/- 0.48), and lower with strict organic meat and dairy use (&gt;90% organic: 0.92 +/- 0.46, P &lt; 0.05) compared to conventional origin of meat and dairy (1.40 +/- 0.61). Similar results were obtained for the 10(trans)18:1/11(trans)18:1-ratio. We conclude that both ratios are indicators of different intake of TFA from ruminant and dairy origin relative to other (including industrial) sources.",M1
20146779,"The time course of new T-wave ECG descriptors following single- and double-dose administration of sotalol in healthy subjects.INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to assess the time course effect of IKr blockade on ECG biomarkers of ventricular repolarization and to evaluate the accuracy of a fully automatic approach for QT duration evaluation. METHODS: Twelve-lead digital ECG Holter was recorded in 38 healthy subjects (27 males, mean age = 27.4 + or - 8.0 years) on baseline conditions (day 0) and after administration of 160 mg (day 1) and 320 mg (day 2) of d-l sotalol. For each 24-hour period and each subject, ECGs were extracted every 10 minutes during the 4-hour period following drug dosage. Ventricular repolarization was characterized using three biomarker categories: conventional ECG time intervals, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) analysis on the T wave, and fully automatic biomarkers computed from a mathematical model of the T wave. RESULTS: QT interval was significantly prolonged starting 1 hour 20 minutes after drug dosing with 160 mg and 1 hour 10 minutes after drug dosing with 320 mg. PCA ventricular repolarization parameters sotalol-induced changes were delayed (&gt;3 hours). After sotalol dosing, the early phase of the T wave changed earlier than the late phase prolongation. Globally, the modeled surrogate QT paralleled manual QT changes. The duration of manual QT and automatic surrogate QT were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001). The Bland and Altman plot revealed a nonstationary systematic bias (bias = 26.5 ms + or - 1.96*SD = 16 ms). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in different ECG biomarkers of ventricular repolarization display different kinetics after administration of a potent potassium channel blocker. These differences need to be taken into account when designing ventricular repolarization ECG studies.",M1
20145882,"A comparative study of two factor analytic models applied to PAH data from inhalable air particulate collected in an urban-industrial environment.Two factor analysis (FA)-based receptor modeling methods were applied to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dataset from extracts of 75 PM(10) air particulate samples collected concurrently at 4 sampling sites proximate to the urban-industrial area in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The total PAH concentrations of 48 target compounds ranged from 0.23 to 172 ng m(-3). Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis were followed by multilinear regression analyses to identify and quantify PAH source contributions, together with spatial and temporal trends. The correlations between predicted and observed total PAH levels were excellent in both models (R(2) &gt; 0.98). The PCA afforded large negative contributions in a number of samples, so further analysis was abandoned. The PMF analysis showed 3 factors which were identified as gasoline emissions, diesel emissions and coke oven emissions. Contributions of gasoline emissions and diesel emissions factors were surprisingly similar at all 4 sites indicative of a background of vehicle emissions across the city. The PMF coke oven emission factor showed the greatest variability in total loadings, consistent with the large PAH emissions from the steel industries and the large influence of wind direction on PAH concentrations. The highest coke oven contributions were observed at sites closest to the industrial area on days when these sites were downwind of the industries. The PMF coke oven impact factor showed good correlations with two commonly used PAH diagnostic ratios when the ratios were combined into a single ratio. This integrated approach allowed us to categorize &gt;90% of the samples based on the wind direction of the impacting source.",M1
20141751,"Systematic study of anharmonic features in a principal component analysis of gramicidin A.We use principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) to detect functionally interesting collective motions in molecular-dynamics simulations of membrane-bound gramicidin A. We examine the statistical and structural properties of all PCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the backbone and side-chain atoms. All eigenvalue spectra show two distinct power-law scaling regimes, quantitatively separating large from small covariance motions. Time trajectories of the largest PCs converge to Gaussian distributions at long timescales, but groups of small-covariance PCs, which are usually ignored as noise, have subdiffusive distributions. These non-Gaussian distributions imply anharmonic motions on the free-energy surface. We characterize the anharmonic components of motion by analyzing the mean-square displacement for all PCs. The subdiffusive components reveal picosecond-scale oscillations in the mean-square displacement at frequencies consistent with infrared measurements. In this regime, the slowest backbone mode exhibits tilting of the peptide planes, which allows carbonyl oxygen atoms to provide surrogate solvation for water and cation transport in the channel lumen. Higher-frequency modes are also apparent, and we describe their vibrational spectra. Our findings expand the utility of PCA for quantifying the essential features of motion on the anharmonic free-energy surface made accessible by atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations.",M1
20141116,"Conformations of some large-ring cyclodextrins derived from conformational search with molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis.Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was applied for postprocessing of trajectories from conformational search, based on 50.0 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the purpose to elucidate the conformations of some large-ring cyclodextrins (LR-CDs), CDn (n = 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29). The dominant PCA modes for concerted motions of the macroring atoms were monitored in a lower-dimension subspace. The first 10 lowest indexed modes describe more than 90% of the total atomic motions in all cases, with about 85% (CD27, CD29) to more than 90% (CD24, CD25) contribution coming from the six highest-eigenvalue principal components. Representative average geometries of the cyclodextrin macrorings were also obtained for the whole simulation and for the five 10.0 ns time intervals of the simulation. Two conformations for CD26, the largest LR-CD for which X-ray data is available, are characterized by possessing, respectively, one and two helical turns. Resemblance to computed representative conformations of CD26 in water was found for CD27 and CD28, with the similarity being better expressed for the former case. Only CD24, among the two smaller size LR-CDs, displays resemblance during short simulation intervals to one of the conformations of CD26. The formation of small loops of six to seven glucose units is a favorable deformation mode of the macrorings. Besides, once a small loop of six to seven glucoses is formed, the next natural mode for deformation of the macromolecule is toward the creation of a short helix that further enhances the stability of the structure. The average geometry of CD29 has no likeness at all to the conformations of CD26. Thus, the difference of three glucose units between CD26 and CD29 already influences significantly the shape of the most probable conformation.",M1
20138791,"A quantum chemical study on a set of non-imidazole H3 antihistamine molecules.Molecular orbital calculations were carried out on a set of 28 non-imidazole H(3) antihistamine compounds using the Hartree-Fock method in order to investigate the possible relationships between electronic structural properties and binding affinity for H(3) receptors (pK(i)). It was observed that the frontier effective-for-reaction molecular orbital (FERMO) energies were better correlated with pK(i) values than highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy values. Exploratory data analysis through hierarchical cluster (HCA) and principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) showed a separation of the compounds in two sets, one grouping the molecules with high pK(i) values, the other gathering low pK(i) value compounds. This separation was obtained with the use of the following descriptors: FERMO energies (epsilon(FERMO)), charges derived from the electrostatic potential on the nitrogen atom (N(1)), electronic density indexes for FERMO on the N(1) atom (Sigma((FERMO))c(i)(2)), and electrophilicity (omega'). These electronic descriptors were used to construct a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model through the partial least-squares (PLS) method with three principal components. This model generated Q(2)=0.88 and R(2)=0.927 values obtained from a training set and external validation of 23 and 5 molecules, respectively. After the analysis of the PLS regression equation and the values for the selected electronic descriptors, it is suggested that high values of FERMO energies and of Sigma ((FERMO))c(i)(2), together with low values of electrophilicity and pronounced negative charges on N(1) appear as desirable properties for the conception of new molecules which might have high binding affinity.",M1
20129681,"Effects of pulp and paper mill effluent extractives on aromatase CYP19a gene expression and sex steroid levels in juvenile triploid rainbow trout.We evaluated plasma testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E2) levels and ovarian aromatase CYP19a gene expression following a single intraperitoneal injection of Chilean pulp and paper mill effluent extracts into juvenile triploid rainbow trout. Fish injected with untreated effluent extracts had increased plasma T after 4 days, while plasma E2 concentration was increased in fish injected with both primary and secondary treated effluent extracts at the same sampling period. Ovarian CYP19a gene expression as measured by qRT-PCR was significantly induced in fish injected with the untreated, primary and secondary treated pulp and paper mill effluent extracts. Similar induction of CYP19a expression was found in fish injected with the androgens androstenedione (ADD) and T. A Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was conducted in order to identify structure in relationships between all measured variables and identifying which factors were most responsible for the variance observed within the plasma steroid levels, upregulation of ovarian CYP19a gene expression and the final estrogenic effect of increased plasma VTG levels. This analysis indicated a cluster correlation between plasma T levels and CYP19a gene expression (Factor 1, explaining 27.2% of total variance), a cluster including condition factor and liver somatic index (Factor 2, explaining 17.3%) and an additional cluster including plasma E2 and vitellogenin levels (Factor 3, explaining an additional 15.8%). The present results indicate that Chilean pulp and paper mill effluent extracts cause estrogenic effects in triploid rainbow trout. These effects could be related to the compounds present in the effluent that act as estrogen receptor agonists, or that induce changes leading to increased amounts of endogenous estrogens, reflected by increased E2 levels and induced aromatase expression/activity.",M1

A pyrolyser coupled to a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (PY-GC-MS) was used to obtain higher chemical universality by analyzing whole compounds including high molecular weight metabolites. The machine was relatively fast and easy to use, with no sample preparation procedure required. Multivariate pattern recognition methods, specifically principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were successful in discriminating various toki samples.

Particles were analyzed for their chemical composition (inorganic ions, elements and PAHs) and the effects produced on the human lung carcinoma epithelial cell line A549. In vitro tests were performed to assess cell viability with MTT assay, cytokine release (IL-6 and IL-8) with ELISA, and DNA damage with COMET assay. Results were investigated by bivariate analysis and multivariate data analysis (Principal Component Analysis, <e>PCA</e>) to investigate the relationship between PM chemical composition and the biological effects produced by cell exposure to 12 microg cm(-2). The different seasonal chemical composition of PM showed to influence some biological properties. Summer PM samples had a high mass contribution of SO(4)(=) (13+/-2%) and were enriched in some elements, like Al, As, Cr, Cu, and Zn, compared to winter PM samples. Cell viability reduction was two times higher for summer PM samples in comparison with winter ones (27+/-5% and 14+/-5%, respectively), and the highest correlation coefficients between cell viability reduction and single chemical components were with As (R(2)=0.57) and SO(4)(=) (R(2)=0.47). PM1 affected cell viability reduction and induced IL-8 release, and these events were interrelated (R(2)=0.95), and apparently connected with the same chemical compounds. PM2.5 fraction, which was enriched in Ca(++) and Mg(++) (from soil dust), and Al, Fe, Zn, Ba Mn, produced cell viability reduction and DNA damage (R(2)=0.73).",M1
20122146,"Scoring and psychometric properties of the Eye-Drop Satisfaction Questionnaire (EDSQ), an instrument to assess satisfaction and compliance with glaucoma treatment.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to ascertain the scoring and assess the psychometric properties of the Eye-Drop Satisfaction Questionnaire (EDSQ), a 43-item Patient-Reported Outcome instrument developed to assess patients' satisfaction and compliance with glaucoma treatment. METHODS: The EDSQ was administered during an observational, retrospective study to 184 French patients treated for glaucoma. The hypothesized structure, including six dimensions (patient-clinician relationship; patient experience; patient-treatment interaction; apprehension; patient knowledge; travel), was tested by assessing the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) and construct-related validity (item convergent and discriminant validity). As unsatisfactory results were demonstrated, another structure was defined using a principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) combined with content of items. Psychometric properties of this new structure were assessed. Scores were compared between low, moderate and high compliance profile groups defined using data collected with the Travalert electronic device. RESULTS: Analyses were performed with the 169 patients who completed at least half of the EDSQ items. The hypothesized structure showed a Cronbach's alpha lower than 0.70 for four dimensions out of six and an overall poor construct-related validity (range of item-scale correlations: 0.00-0.68). The new structure obtained with the PCA included six dimensions: concern about treatment (five items); concern about disease (two items); satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship (five items); positive beliefs (three items); treatment convenience (three items); and self-declared compliance (three items). A score ranging from 0 to 100 was calculated for each dimension, with higher scores indicating more of the attribute referred to in the dimension. Internal consistency reliability was good (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.70 for five dimensions). The structure offered good construct-related validity (range of item-scale correlations: 0.36-0.82). Ceiling effects of 21% and 49%, were observed for the satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship and self-declared compliance scores. Patients in low compliance profile group reported the lowest score for the satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship, positive beliefs, treatment convenience and self-declared compliance dimensions, and the highest score for the concern about treatment dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The scoring of the EDSQ was developed and the questionnaire proved to have satisfactory psychometric properties. EDSQ scores showed a promising relationship to compliance profiles. The EDSQ could be used in future studies.",M1
20121588,"Femur statistical atlas construction based on two-level 3D non-rigid registration.The statistical atlas is a 3D medical image analysis tool to enable more patient-oriented and efficient diagnosis. The atlas includes information on geometry and its variation across populations. The comparison with information from other patients is very useful for objective quantitative diagnosis. The statistical atlas can also be used to solve other challenging problems such as image segmentation. As a key to the construction of statistical atlases, 3D registration remains an important yet unsolved problem in the medical image field due to the geometrical complexity of anatomical shapes and the computational complexity arising from the enormous size of volume data. In this work we developed a two-level framework to efficiently solve 3D non-rigid registration, and applied the method to the problem of constructing statistical atlases of the femur. In contrast to a general multi-resolution framework, we employed an interpolation to propagate the matching instead of repeating the registration scheme in each resolution. The registration procedure is divided into two levels: a low-resolution solution to the correspondences and mapping of surface models using Chui and Rangarajan's thin-plate spline (TPS)-based algorithm, followed by an interpolation to achieve high-resolution matching. Next, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) is used to build the statistical atlases. Experimental results show the shape variation learned from the atlases, and also demonstrate that our method significantly improves the efficiency of registration without decreasing the accuracy of the atlases.",M1
20109147,"An emergent self-organizing map based analysis pipeline for comparative metabolome studies.Modern high-throughput techniques allow for the identification and quantification of hundreds of metabolites ofa biological system which cover central parts of the metabolome. Due to the amount and complexity of obtained data there is an increasing need for the development of appropriate computational interpretation methods. A novel data analysis pipeline designed for high-throughput determined metabolomic data is presented. The combination of principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) with emergent self-organizing maps (ESOM) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)algorithms is used to unravel the structure underlying metabolomic data sets, including the detection of outliers. Observed differences between various analyzed metabolomes are automatically mapped and visualized using KEGG metabolic pathway maps. This way typical metabolic biomarker for data sets from various analyzed growth conditions and genetic backgrounds become visible. In order to validate the described methods we analyzed time resolved metabolomic datasets obtained for Corynebacterium glutamicum cells grown on various carbon sources consisting of 126 different metabolic patterns.

Metabolic biomarkers typical for the utilized carbon sources and analyzed growth phases were identified.",M1
20104493,"Measuring disability across cultures--the psychometric properties of the WHODAS II in older people from seven low- and middle-income countries. The 10/66 Dementia Research Group population-based survey.We evaluated the psychometric properties of the 12-item interviewer-administered screener version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule-version II (WHODAS II) among older people living in seven low- and middle-income countries. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Mokken analyses were carried out to test for unidimensionality, hierarchical structure, and measurement invariance across 10/66 Dementia Research Group sites. PCA generated a one-factor solution in most sites. In CFA, the two-factor solution generated in Dominican Republic fitted better for all sites other than rural China. The two factors were not easily interpretable, and may have been an artefact of differing item difficulties. Strong internal consistency and high factor loadings for the one-factor solution supported unidimensionality. Furthermore, the WHODAS II was found to be a 'strong' Mokken scale. Measurement invariance was supported by the similarity of factor loadings across sites, and by the high between-site correlations in item difficulties. The Mokken results strongly support that the WHODAS II 12-item screener is a unidimensional and hierarchical scale confirming to item response theory (IRT) principles, at least at the monotone homogeneity model level. More work is needed to assess the generalizability of our findings to different populations.",M1
20103941,"Household out-of-pocket expenditures on health care in Bangladesh according to principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>).In Bangladesh, illness results in large out-of-pocket health care expenditures for households. Identifying the components associated with health care expenditures should prove meaningful for future policy formulation in Bangladesh. Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate the overall influence of individual health care costs over data space in a probalistic way using Principal Component Analysis for expenditures incurred due to a recent illness. The study is based on secondary data of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted in 2005 by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. This survey is a nationally representative survey in Bangladesh and its sample includes 8,126 individuals who have incurred health care expenditures in the 30 days prior to the survey. Principal Component Analysis was used to analyze the influence of the factors of health care expenditures in Bangladesh. According to results, 58% of the information on the overall data space confirmed that the cost of medicine is greater than any other factor for health care expenditures. Drug-related health expenditures represented a large component and suggest the need for policies promoting the rational use of drugs. If such strategies are considered and implemented in operational stages, the quality of health care should improve and drug expenditures should substantially decrease.",M1
20103154,"Colour and pigment composition of red wines obtained from co-maceration of Tempranillo and Graciano varieties.The Vitis vinifera L. cv Graciano is often used as an integral component of Rioja wines because it is considered to contribute significantly to the quality of Tempranillo based wines. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of the incorporation of the Graciano variety on the colour and pigment composition of Tempranillo based wine and to evaluate the possible differences between blending Tempranillo with Graciano varietal wine (W wine) in contrast to a wine obtained by mixing these two grape varieties in the prefermentative maceration step (M wine). Results indicated that pigment extraction and retention in M wine was higher than in Tempranillo (T) wine. Colour differences (DeltaE(ab)(*)) between wines at the end of the study (after 12 months in bottles) were detectable by the human eye (DeltaE(ab)(*) &gt; or = 3) in all cases except for T and W. These wines have indistinguishable colours even when using analytical methods (DeltaE(ab)(*) &lt; or = 1). Regarding hue h(ab), T and W presented higher values (more orange-red) than Graciano (G) and M (more blue-red). <e>PCA</e> allowed the colour and composition analytical data to be reduced to a small number of principal components that could separate successfully between T and G wines and between the different steps of the winemaking process.",M1
20103118,"Study on seafood volatile profile characteristics during storage and its potential use for freshness evaluation by headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Seafood volatile profile characteristics at different storage phases are various and can be used for freshness evaluation during storage. It is imperative to obtain the full volatile information prior to the further study of seafood volatile profile characteristics during storage. Also, the efficient data-processing method is another important factor for the interpretation of seafood volatile profile characteristics during storage and related potential volatile markers. In this work, a new analytical strategy, including the efficient sampling technique, sensitive detection and suitable data-processing method, for seafood freshness evaluation was developed based on the volatile profile characteristics during storage. First, the study of volatiles of seafood samples including razor clam, redspot swimming crab and prawn at different storage phases were conducted by headspace solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection. Then, seafood volatile profile characteristics at different storage phases were statistically interpreted by a combination data-processing method including normalization, principle component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and common model strategy. The different seafood volatile profile characteristics and potential volatile markers were attempted to be distilled. The results tentatively suggested that the different seafood volatile profile characteristics during storage could reflect the transitional changing seafood freshness and provide more precise warning information for seafood spoilage during storage than any single chemical markers. This work developed an analytical method for study of seafood volatile profile characteristics and tentatively proposed a new idea of using seafood volatile profile characteristics during storage for the freshness evaluation from the point of view of analytical chemistry.",M1
20100356,"<e>PCA</e>-based bootstrap confidence interval tests for gene-disease association involving multiple SNPs.BACKGROUND: Genetic association study is currently the primary vehicle for identification and characterization of disease-predisposing variant(s) which usually involves multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available. However, SNP-wise association tests raise concerns over multiple testing. Haplotype-based methods have the advantage of being able to account for correlations between neighbouring SNPs, yet assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and potentially large number degrees of freedom can harm its statistical power and robustness. Approaches based on principal component analysis (PCA) are preferable in this regard but their performance varies with methods of extracting principal components (PCs). RESULTS: PCA-based bootstrap confidence interval test (PCA-BCIT), which directly uses the PC scores to assess gene-disease association, was developed and evaluated for three ways of extracting PCs, i.e., cases only(CAES), controls only(COES) and cases and controls combined(CES). Extraction of PCs with COES is preferred to that with CAES and CES. Performance of the test was examined via simulations as well as analyses on data of rheumatoid arthritis and heroin addiction, which maintains nominal level under null hypothesis and showed comparable performance with permutation test. CONCLUSIONS: PCA-BCIT is a valid and powerful method for assessing gene-disease association involving multiple SNPs.",M1
20091299,"The principle of exhaustiveness versus the principle of parsimony: a new approach for the identification of biomarkers from proteomic spot volume datasets based on principal component analysis.The field of biomarkers discovery is one of the leading research areas in proteomics. One of the most exploited approaches to this purpose consists of the identification of potential biomarkers from spot volume datasets produced by 2D gel electrophoresis. In this case, problems may arise due to the large number of spots present in each map and the small number of maps available for each class (control/pathological). Multivariate methods are therefore usually applied together with variable selection procedures, to provide a subset of potential candidates. The variable selection procedures available usually pursue the so-called principle of parsimony: the most parsimonious set of spots is selected, providing the best classification performances. This approach is not effective in proteomics since all potential biomarkers must be identified: not only the most discriminating spots, usually related to general responses to inflammatory events, but also the smallest differences and all redundant molecules, i.e. biomarkers showing similar behaviour. The principle of exhaustiveness should be pursued rather than parsimony. To solve this problem, a new ranking and classification method,  Ranking-<e>PCA</e> , based on principal component analysis and variable selection in forward search, is proposed here for the exhaustive identification of all possible biomarkers. The method is successfully applied to three different proteomic datasets to prove its effectiveness.",M1
20089145,"Effects of apples and specific apple components on the cecal environment of conventional rats: role of apple pectin.BACKGROUND: Our study was part of the large European project ISAFRUIT aiming to reveal the biological explanations for the epidemiologically well-established health effects of fruits. The objective was to identify effects of apple and apple product consumption on the composition of the cecal microbial community in rats, as well as on a number of cecal parameters, which may be influenced by a changed microbiota. RESULTS: Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) of cecal microbiota profiles obtained by PCR-DGGE targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed an effect of whole apples in a long-term feeding study (14 weeks), while no effects of apple juice, purée or pomace on microbial composition in cecum were observed. Administration of either 0.33 or 3.3% apple pectin in the diet resulted in considerable changes in the DGGE profiles.A 2-fold increase in the activity of beta-glucuronidase was observed in animals fed with pectin (7% in the diet) for four weeks, as compared to control animals (P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, the level of butyrate measured in these pectin-fed animal was more than double of the corresponding level in control animals (P &lt; 0.01). Sequencing revealed that DGGE bands, which were suppressed in pectin-fed rats, represented Gram-negative anaerobic rods belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, whereas bands that became more prominent represented mainly Gram-positive anaerobic rods belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, and specific species belonging to the Clostridium Cluster XIVa.Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed a lower amount of given Bacteroidetes species in the pectin-fed rats as well as in the apple-fed rats in the four-week study (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, a more than four-fold increase in the amount of Clostridium coccoides (belonging to Cluster XIVa), as well as of genes encoding butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase, which is involved in butyrate production, was detected by quantitative PCR in fecal samples from the pectin-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that consumption of apple pectin (7% in the diet) increases the population of butyrate- and beta-glucuronidase producing Clostridiales, and decreases the population of specific species within the Bacteroidetes group in the rat gut. Similar changes were not caused by consumption of whole apples, apple juice, purée or pomace.",M1
20087373,"Plasma free fatty acid patterns and their relationship with CVD risk in a male middle-aged population.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The role of individual fatty acids in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well established, but the effects of an overall pattern of fatty acids in CVD risk has yet to be elucidated. Circulating fatty acid levels are related to metabolic disturbances associated with the metabolic syndrome and CVD, due to disturbances in the activity of enzymes that catalyse fatty acid desaturation (Delta-desaturases). Therefore, we determined patterns of fatty acids and estimated desaturase activity in plasma and analysed how these patterns were related to a 10-year CVD risk estimates in a middle-aged male population in Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Principal components analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was performed for defining fatty acid patterns in 379 men aged 30-49 years. Logistic regression analyses were then carried out for analysing the relationship between these fatty acid patterns and the 10-year CVD risk estimates. RESULTS: The PCA generated three high fatty acid patterns: high saturated fatty acid (SFA), high omega 3 fatty acid (omega 3) and high monosaturated fatty acid (MNFA). Results from logistic regression analyses show that a 1 s.d. increase in the SFA pattern score was significantly and positively associated with an increase in the 10-year CVD risk category (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.21, P&lt;0.0001) even after adjustment for lifestyle factors. There were no significant relationships between the other two pattern scores and the 10-year CVD risk. CONCLUSIONS: An unhealthy fatty acid pattern representing both dietary intake and in vivo fatty acid metabolism is related to the 10-year CVD risk estimates and provide evidence that, as with dietary patterns, the synergistic effect of multiple fatty acids may be more important in relation to the development of CVD risk.",M1
20082029,"Discrimination between diffuse and point sources of arsenic at Zimapán, Hidalgo state, Mexico.There are two principal sources of arsenic in Zimapán. Point sources are linked to mining and smelting activities and especially to mine tailings. Diffuse sources are not well defined and are linked to regional flow systems in carbonate rocks. Both sources are caused by the oxidation of arsenic-rich sulfidic mineralization. Point sources are characterized by Ca-SO(4)-HCO(3) ground water type and relatively enriched values of deltaD, delta(18)O, and delta(34)S(SO(4)). Diffuse sources are characterized by Ca-Na-HCO(3) type of ground water and more depleted values of deltaD, delta(18)O, and delta(34)S(SO(4)). Values of deltaD and delta(18)O indicate similar altitude of recharge for both arsenic sources and stronger impact of evaporation for point sources in mine tailings. There are also different values of delta(34)S(SO(4)) for both sources, presumably due to different types of mineralization or isotopic zonality in deposits. In Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>), the principal component 1 (PC1), which describes the impact of sulfide oxidation and neutralization by the dissolution of carbonates, has higher values in samples from point sources. In spite of similar concentrations of As in ground water affected by diffuse sources and point sources (mean values 0.21 mg L(-1) and 0.31 mg L(-1), respectively, in the years from 2003 to 2008), the diffuse sources have more impact on the health of population in Zimapán. This is caused by the extraction of ground water from wells tapping regional flow system. In contrast, wells located in the proximity of mine tailings are not generally used for water supply.",M1
20079593,"Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) for time-dependent profiling of raw and steamed Panax notoginseng.The metabolic profiles of Panax notoginseng and its associated therapeutic values are critically affected by the duration of steaming. The time-dependent steaming effect of P. notoginseng is not well-characterized and there is also no official guideline on its duration of steaming. In this paper, a UHPLC/TOFMS-based metabolomic platform was developed for the qualitative profiling of multiparametric metabolic changes of raw P. notoginseng during the steaming process. Our method was successful in discriminating the differentially processed herbs. Both the unsupervised principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) score plot (R(2)X=0.664, Q(2) (cum)=0.622, and PCs=2) and the supervised partial least square-data analysis (PLS-DA) model (R(2)X=0.708, R(2)Y=0.461, and Q(2)Y=0.271) demonstrated strong classification and clear trajectory patterns with regard to the duration of steaming. The PLS-DA model was validated for its robustness via a prediction set, confirming that the UHPLC/TOFMS metabolic profiles of the raw and differentially steamed P. notoginseng samples were highly reproducible. Based on our method, the minimum durations of steaming for the maximum production of bioactive ginsenosides such as Rg3 and Rh2 were also predicted. Our novel time-dependent metabolic profiling approach represents the paradigm shift in the quality control of P. notoginseng products.",M1
20075459,"Human action recognition in videos using kinematic features and multiple instance learning.We propose a set of kinematic features that are derived from the optical flow for human action recognition in videos. The set of kinematic features includes divergence, vorticity, symmetric and antisymmetric flow fields, second and third principal invariants of flow gradient and rate of strain tensor, and third principal invariant of rate of rotation tensor. Each kinematic feature, when computed from the optical flow of a sequence of images, gives rise to a spatiotemporal pattern. It is then assumed that the representative dynamics of the optical flow are captured by these spatiotemporal patterns in the form of dominant kinematic trends or kinematic modes. These kinematic modes are computed by performing Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) on the spatiotemporal volumes of the kinematic features. For classification, we propose the use of multiple instance learning (MIL) in which each action video is represented by a bag of kinematic modes. Each video is then embedded into a kinematic-mode-based feature space and the coordinates of the video in that space are used for classification using the nearest neighbor algorithm. The qualitative and quantitative results are reported on the benchmark data sets.",M1
20066907,"Fine particle receptor modeling in the atmosphere of Mexico City.Source apportionment analyses were carried out by means of receptor modeling techniques to determine the contribution of major fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sources found at six sites in Mexico City. Thirty-six source profiles were determined within Mexico City to establish the fingerprints of particulate matter sources. Additionally, the profiles under the same source category were averaged using cluster analysis and the fingerprints of 10 sources were included. Before application of the chemical mass balance (CMB), several tests were carried out to determine the best combination of source profiles and species used for the fitting. CMB results showed significant spatial variations in source contributions among the six sites that are influenced by local soil types and land use. On average, 24-hr PM2.5 concentrations were dominated by mobile source emissions (45%), followed by secondary inorganic aerosols (16%) and geological material (17%). Industrial emissions representing oil combustion and incineration contributed less than 5%, and their contribution was higher at the industrial areas of Tlalnepantla (11%) and Xalostoc (8%). Other sources such as cooking, biomass burning, and oil fuel combustion were identified at lower levels. A second receptor model (principal component analysis, [<e>PCA</e>]) was subsequently applied to three of the monitoring sites for comparison purposes. Although differences were obtained between source contributions, results evidence the advantages of the combined use of different receptor modeling techniques for source apportionment, given the complementary nature of their results. Further research is needed in this direction to reach a better agreement between the estimated source contributions to the particulate matter mass.",M1
20060702,"Functional changes in culturable microbial communities during a co-composting process: carbon source utilization and co-metabolism.Microbial communities in sewage sludge and green waste co-composting were investigated using culture-dependent methods and community level physiological profiles (CLPP) with Biolog Microplate. Different microbial groups characterized each stage of composting. Bacterial densities were high from beginning to end of composting, whereas actinomycete densities increased only after bio-oxidation phase i.e. after 40days. Fungal populations become particularly high during the last stage of decomposition. Cluster analyses of metabolic profiles revealed a similar separation between two groups of composts at 67days for bacteria and fungi. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) applied to bacterial and fungal CLPP data showed a chronological distribution of composts with two phases. The first one (before 67days), where the composts were characterized by the rapid decomposition of non-humic biodegradable organic matter, was significantly correlated to the decrease of C, C/N, organic matter (OM), fulvic acid (FA), respiration, cellulase, protease, phenoloxidase, alkaline and acid phosphatases activities. The second phase corresponding to the formation of polycondensed humic-like substances was significantly correlated to humic acid (HA) content, pH and HA/FA. The influent substrates selected on both factorial maps showed that microbial communities could adapt their metabolic capacities to the particular environment. The first phase seems to be focused on easily degradable substrate utilization whereas the maturation phase appears as multiple metabolisms, which induce the release of metabolites and their polymerization leading to humification processes.",M1
20056527,"Evaluation of spatial and temporal variation in water quality by pattern recognition techniques: A case study on Jajrood River (Tehran, Iran).In this paper, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) methods have been used to investigate the water quality of Jajrood River (Iran) and to assess and discriminate the relative magnitude of anthropogenic and  natural  influences on the quality of river water. T, EC, pH, TDS, NH(4), NO(3), NO(2), Turb., T.Hard., Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO(4), SiO(2) as physicochemical and TC, FC as biochemical variables have been analyzed in the water samples collected every month over a three-year period from 18 sampling stations along a 50 km section of Jajrood River that is under the influence of anthropogenic and natural changes. Exploratory analysis of experimental data has been carried out by means of PCA and CA in an attempt to discriminate sources of variation in water quality. PCA has allowed identification of a reduced number of mean 5 varifactors, pointing out 85% of both temporal and spatial changes. CA classified similar water quality stations and indicated Out-Meygoon as the most polluted one. Ahar, Baghgol, Rooteh, Befor Zaygan, Fasham, Roodak and Lashgarak were identified as affected by organic pollution. A Scree plot of stations in the first and second extracted components on PCA also gave us a classification of stations due to the similarity of pollution sources. CA and PCA led to similar results, though Out-Meygoon was identified as the most polluted station in both methods. Box-plots showed that PCA could approximately demonstrate temporal and spatial variations. CA gave us an overview of the problem and helped us to classify and better explain the PCA results.",M1
20056465,"The solution structures of the cucumber mosaic virus and tomato aspermy virus coat proteins explored with molecular dynamics simulations.The three-dimensional structures of two cucumovirus coat proteins (CP), namely Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Tomato aspermy virus (TAV), were explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The N-terminal domain and the C-terminal tail of the CPs proved to be intrinsically unstructured protein regions in aqueous solution. The N-terminal alpha-helix had a partially unrolled conformation. The thermal factor analysis of the CP loop regions demonstrated that the CMV CP had more flexible loop regions than the TAV CP. The principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) of the MD trajectories showed that the first three eigenvectors represented the three main conformational motions in the CPs. The first motion components with the highest variance contribution described an opening movement between the hinge and the N-terminal domain of both CPs. The second eigenvector showed a closing motion, while the third eigenvector represented crosswise conformational fluctuations. These new findings, together with previous results, suggest that the hinge region of CPs plays a central role in the recognition and binding of viral RNA.",M1
20045197,"Climatic relationships with specific clinical subtypes of depression.Studies on the relationship between climate and unipolar depression rates have yielded mixed results, which could be attributed to the inclusion of heterogeneous clinical samples and the use of admission rather than onset dates. This study aimed to overcome these methodological issues. During an 8-year timeframe, onset rates of unipolar depressive episodes requiring hospitalization from individuals living up to 15 km from a selected meteorological station were stratified by clinical subtypes and modeled as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) functions of orthogonal climatic factors obtained by Principal Components Analysis (<e>PCA</e>). For comparison purposes, onset rates stratified by demographic factors and by diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and admission rates were also modeled. The main findings were a negative 1-month delayed relationship between onset rates of episodes with melancholic features and a climatic factor mainly composed of ambient temperature/sunlight, and a negative 1-month delayed relationship between onset rates of episodes with psychotic features and a climatic factor mainly composed of barometric pressure. Results of this study support a climatic-rather than seasonal-influence in specific subtypes of depression. If replicated, they may have nosological and therapeutic implications.",M1
20043354,"Discrimination of rice panicles by hyperspectral reflectance data based on principal component analysis and support vector classification.Detection of crop health conditions plays an important role in making control strategies of crop disease and insect damage and gaining high-quality production at late growth stages. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance of rice panicles was measured at the visible and near-infrared regions. The panicles were divided into three groups according to health conditions: healthy panicles, empty panicles caused by Nilaparvata lugens Stål, and panicles infected with Ustilaginoidea virens. Low order derivative spectra, namely, the first and second orders, were obtained using different techniques. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was performed to obtain the principal component spectra (PCS) of the foregoing derivative and raw spectra to reduce the reflectance spectral dimension. Support vector classification (SVC) was employed to discriminate the healthy, empty, and infected panicles, with the front three PCS as the independent variables. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were used to assess the classification accuracy of SVC. The overall accuracies of SVC with PCS derived from the raw, first, and second reflectance spectra for the testing dataset were 96.55%, 99.14%, and 96.55%, and the kappa coefficients were 94.81%, 98.71%, and 94.82%, respectively. Our results demonstrated that it is feasible to use visible and near-infrared spectroscopy to discriminate health conditions of rice panicles.",M1
20036270,"Transcriptomics-based identification of developmental toxicants through their interference with cardiomyocyte differentiation of embryonic stem cells.The embryonic stem cell test (EST) predicts developmental toxicity based on the inhibition of cardiomyocyte differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC). The subjective endpoint, the long culture duration together with the undefined applicability domain and related predictivity need further improvement to facilitate implementation of the EST into regulatory strategies. These aspects may be improved by studying gene expression changes in the ESC differentiation cultures and their modulation by compound exposure using transcriptomics. Here, we tested the developmental toxicants monobutyl phthalate and 6-aminonicotinamide. ESC were allowed to differentiated, and cardiomyocyte differentiation was assessed after 10 days of culture. RNA of solvent controls was collected after 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of exposure, and RNA of developmental-toxicant-exposed cultures was collected after 24 and 96 h. Samples were hybridized to DNA microarrays, and 1355 genes were found differentially expressed among the unexposed experimental groups. These regulated genes were involved in differentiation-related processes, and Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) based on these genes showed that the unexposed experimental groups appeared in chronological order in the PCA, which can therefore be regarded as a continuous representation of the differentiation track. The developmental-toxicant-exposed cultures appeared to deviate significantly from this differentiation track, which confirms the compound-modulating effects on the differentiation process. The incorporation of transcriptomics in the EST is expected to provide a more informative and improved endpoint in the EST as compared with morphology, allowing early detection of differentiation modulation. Furthermore, this approach may improve the definition of the applicability domain and predictivity of the EST.",M1
20036054,"Olive mill wastewater evaporation management using <e>PCA</e> method Case study of natural degradation in stabilization ponds (Sfax, Tunisia).Olive mill wastewater (OMW) evaporation ponds management was investigated in five serial evaporation open-air multiponds of 50 ha located in Sfax (Tunisia). Physico-chemical parameters and microbial flora evolution were considered. Empirical models describing the OMW characteristic changes with the operation time were established and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) described the correlation between physico-chemical and biological parameters. COD, BOD, total solids, polyphenols and electrical conductivity exhibited first-order models. Four groups exhibited high correlations. The first included temperature, density, COD, TSS, TS, BOD, VS, TOC, TKN, polyphenols and minerals. The second group was made up of yeasts and moulds. The third group was established with phenolic compounds, total sugars, fats, total phosphorous, NH(4)(+) and pH. The fourth group was constituted by exclusively aerobic bacteria. Bacterial-growth toxic effect was exhibited by high organic load, ash content and polyphenols, whereas moulds and yeasts were more adapted to OMW. During the storage, all the third group parameter values decreased and were inversely related to the others. In the last pond, COD, BOD, TS and TSS rates were reduced by 40%, 50%, 50% and 75% respectively. The evaporation and the biological activity were the main processes acting, predicting the OMW behavior during evaporation in air-open ponds.",M1

20028141,"Free-energy landscape of RNA hairpins constructed via dihedral angle principal component analysis.To systematically construct a low-dimensional free-energy landscape of RNA systems from a classical molecular dynamics simulation, various versions of the principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) are compared: the cPCA using the Cartesian coordinates of all atoms, the dPCA using the sine/cosine-transformed six backbone dihedral angles as well as the glycosidic torsional angle chi and the pseudorotational angle P, the aPCA which ignores the circularity of the 6 + 2 dihedral angles of the RNA, and the dPCA(etatheta), which approximates the 6 backbone dihedral angles by 2 pseudotorsional angles eta and theta. As representative examples, a 10-nucleotide UUCG hairpin and the 36-nucleotide segment SL1 of the Psi site of HIV-1 are studied by classical molecular dynamics simulation, using the Amber all-atom force field and explicit solvent. It is shown that the conformational heterogeneity of the RNA hairpins can only be resolved by an angular PCA such as the dPCA but not by the cPCA using Cartesian coordinates. Apart from possible artifacts due to the coupling of overall and internal motion, this is because the details of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions but also of global structural rearrangements of the RNA are better discriminated by dihedral angles. In line with recent experiments, it is found that the free energy landscape of RNA hairpins is quite rugged and contains various metastable conformational states which may serve as an intermediate for unfolding.",M1
20026297,"Analysis of metabolomic <e>PCA</e> data using tree diagrams.Large amounts of data from high-throughput metabolomic experiments are commonly visualized using a principal component analysis (PCA) two-dimensional scores plot. The question of the similarity or difference between multiple metabolic states then becomes a question of the degree of overlap between their respective data point clusters in principal component (PC) scores space. A qualitative visual inspection of the clustering pattern in PCA scores plots is a common protocol. This article describes the application of tree diagrams and bootstrapping techniques for an improved quantitative analysis of metabolic PCA data clustering. Our PCAtoTree program creates a distance matrix with 100 bootstrap steps that describes the separation of all clusters in a metabolic data set. Using accepted phylogenetic software, the distance matrix resulting from the various metabolic states is organized into a phylogenetic-like tree format, where bootstrap values 50 indicate a statistically relevant branch separation. PCAtoTree analysis of two previously published data sets demonstrates the improved resolution of metabolic state differences using tree diagrams. In addition, for metabolomic studies of large numbers of different metabolic states, the tree format provides a better description of similarities and differences between each metabolic state. The approach is also tolerant of sample size variations between different metabolic states.",M1

Preprocessing multicontrast composite images with Kernel <e>PCA</e> was found to be superior to traditional linear PCA preprocessing, especially in difficult classification scenarios where high-order nonlinear correlations are expected to be important. Systematic study of our approach under different overlap conditions suggests that it possesses sufficient speed and accuracy for use in some practical systems.",M1

Despite a recent trend toward continuous flow VADs, the HeartMate XVE is still commonly used, but its longevity remains a significant limitation. Existing surveillance methods of pump failure often give inconclusive results. XVE electrical current waveforms were collected regularly (2001-2008) and sorted into quartiles according to number of days until pump failure (Q1, 0-34; Q2, 34-160; Q3, 160-300; and Q4, 300-390 days). Thoratec waveform files were converted into text files. The 10-second electrical current, voltage waveform was identified and isolated for analysis. Waveforms were analyzed by principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) and with a fast Fourier transform. Quartiles were compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Waveforms (n = 454) were collected for 21 patients with failed pumps. An artificial neural network was used to predict pump failure within 30 days from the waveform characteristics identified though signal processing.",M1
20018443,"Spatial characterization of dissolved trace elements and heavy metals in the upper Han River (China) using multivariate statistical techniques.A data matrix (4032 observations), obtained during a 2-year monitoring period (2005-2006) from 42 sites in the upper Han River is subjected to various multivariate statistical techniques including cluster analysis, principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>), factor analysis (FA), correlation analysis and analysis of variance to determine the spatial characterization of dissolved trace elements and heavy metals. Our results indicate that waters in the upper Han River are primarily polluted by Al, As, Cd, Pb, Sb and Se, and the potential pollutants include Ba, Cr, Hg, Mn and Ni. Spatial distribution of trace metals indicates the polluted sections mainly concentrate in the Danjiang, Danjiangkou Reservoir catchment and Hanzhong Plain, and the most contaminated river is in the Hanzhong Plain. Q-model clustering depends on geographical location of sampling sites and groups the 42 sampling sites into four clusters, i.e., Danjiang, Danjiangkou Reservoir region (lower catchment), upper catchment and one river in headwaters pertaining to water quality. The headwaters, Danjiang and lower catchment, and upper catchment correspond to very high polluted, moderate polluted and relatively low polluted regions, respectively. Additionally, PCA/FA and correlation analysis demonstrates that Al, Cd, Mn, Ni, Fe, Si and Sr are controlled by natural sources, whereas the other metals appear to be primarily controlled by anthropogenic origins though geogenic source contributing to them.",M1
20017474,"Online fluorescence suppression in modulated Raman spectroscopy.Label-free chemical characterization of single cells is an important aim for biomedical research. Standard Raman spectroscopy provides intrinsic biochemical markers for noninvasive analysis of biological samples but is often hindered by the presence of fluorescence background. In this paper, we present an innovative modulated Raman spectroscopy technique to filter out the Raman spectra from the fluorescence background. The method is based on the principle that the fluorescence background does not change whereas the Raman scattering is shifted by the periodical modulation of the laser wavelength. Exploiting this physical property and importantly the multichannel lock-in detection of the Raman signal, the modulation technique fulfills the requirements of an effective fluorescence subtraction method. Indeed, once the synchronization and calibration procedure is performed, minimal user intervention is required, making the method online and less time-consuming than the other fluorescent suppression methods. We analyze the modulated Raman signal and shifted excitation Raman difference spectroscopy (SERDS) signal of 2 mum-sized polystyrene beads suspended in a solution of fluorescent dye as a function of modulation rate. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the modulated Raman spectra at the highest modulation rate is 3 times higher than the SERDS one. To finally evaluate the real benefits of the modulated Raman spectroscopy, we apply our technique to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Specifically, by analyzing separate spectra from the membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus of CHO cells, we demonstrate the ability of this method to obtain localized sensitive chemical information from cells, away from the interfering fluorescence background. In particular, statistical analysis of the Raman data and classification using <e>PCA</e> (principal component analysis) indicate that our method allows us to distinguish between different cell locations with higher sensitivity and specificity, avoiding potential misinterpretation of the data obtained using standard background procedures.",M1
20017167,"Retrospective analysis of prostate cancer recurrence potential with tissue metabolomic profiles.BACKGROUND: In clinical care of prostate cancer patients, an improved method to assess the risk of recurrence after surgical treatment is urgently needed. We aim to retrospectively evaluate the ability of ex vivo tissue magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy-based metabolomic profiles to estimate the risk of recurrence. METHODS: <e>PCa</e> recurrence is defined biochemically as the detection of serum PSA after radical prostatectomy. Sixteen consecutive PCa-recurrent cases, those with an initial PSA increase of 0.69 +/- 0.26 ng/ml monitored 47.7 +/- 2.6 months after prostatectomy were paired by age and Gleason score with cases without recurrence of the same pathological and clinical stages (n = 16/each). We analyzed ex vivo intact-tissue spectroscopy results from these 48 individuals at the time of prostatectomy at 14T. From these spectra, we identified the 27 most common and intense spectral metabolic regions for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Principal component analysis (PCA) on these spectral regions from cases of clinical-stage-matched groups with and without recurrence identified four pathology-related principal components. Canonical analysis of these four and the first nine principal components for cases in the two groups defined metabolomic profiles as the canonical score that can differentiate the two groups with statistical significance. By applying the coefficients from PCA and canonical analysis to the pathological-stage-matched groups, recurrence was predicted with an accuracy of 78%. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the potential of tissue metabolomic profiles measured with ex vivo spectroscopy to identify PCa aggressiveness in terms of cancer recurrence. With further study, this may greatly contribute to the future design of clinical strategy for personalized treatment of PCa patients.",M1
20012109,"Neuropathological heterogeneity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy: a quantitative study of 94 cases using principal components analysis.Studies suggest that frontotemporal lobar degeneration with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP) is heterogeneous with division into four or five subtypes. To determine the degree of heterogeneity and the validity of the subtypes, we studied neuropathological variation within the frontal and temporal lobes of 94 cases of FTLD-TDP using quantitative estimates of density and principal components analysis (<e>PCA</e>). A PCA based on the density of TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, oligodendroglial inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and dystrophic neurites, surviving neurons, enlarged neurons, and vacuolation suggested that cases were not segregated into distinct subtypes. Variation in the density of the vacuoles was the greatest source of variation between cases. A PCA based on TDP-43 pathology alone suggested that cases of FTLD-TDP with progranulin (GRN) mutation segregated to some degree. The pathological phenotype of all four subtypes overlapped but subtypes 1 and 4 were the most distinctive. Cases with coexisting motor neuron disease (MND) or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) also appeared to segregate to some extent. We suggest: (1) pathological variation in FTLD-TDP is best described as a 'continuum' without clearly distinct subtypes, (2) vacuolation was the single greatest source of variation and reflects the 'stage' of the disease, and (3) within the FTLD-TDP 'continuum' cases with GRN mutation and with coexisting MND or HS may have a more distinctive pathology.",M1
20005332,"Characterisation of free and glycosidically bound odourant compounds of Aragonez clonal musts by GC-O.To evaluate the potential aroma of Aragonez clonal red musts, several free and glycosidically bound odourant compounds were extracted. Then, the gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) posterior intensity method was used to evaluate their odour intensity and the compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A group of eight sniffers evaluated free and bound fractions of Aragonez musts and perceived forty-three and twenty-two odourant peaks respectively. Furaneol (burnt sugar, candy-cotton) and vanillin (vanilla, sweet) were identified in both free and bound fractions of Aragonez musts, indicating their grape-derived origin. Principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) was applied to the posterior intensity method data and a relationship between the different odourant compound variables and the free fractions was established. Two principal components (PCs) were found which together explained 100% of the total variance. A large number of potentially important but yet unknown odourants was detected by the GC-O analysis.",M1
20005079,"Response to drug treatment in newly diagnosed epilepsy: a pilot study of (1)H NMR- and MS-based metabonomic analysis.Understanding the biological basis of drug resistance and developing techniques which facilitate prediction of outcome have the potential to revolutionize the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy. We have performed a pilot study of metabonomic analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) in an effort to identify metabolic biomarkers of response to antiepileptic drug treatment. Pre-treatment serum samples were obtained from 125 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who were taking part in a randomised monotherapy trial. Outcome (responder, non-responder) was assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after starting treatment. Serum samples were subject to investigation by both NMR and MS and the resulting data interrogated by principal components analysis (<e>PCA</e>). There was no clear distinction in the metabolic profile, acquired by either NMR or MS, of responders and non-responders to AED treatment at any of the three clinical end-points investigated, suggesting that pre-treatment serum samples do not contain any prominent biomarkers of responsiveness to initial treatment in new-onset epilepsy. Metabonomic analysis is undoubtedly applicable to the search for biological predictors of response to drug treatment in epilepsy, but future studies should employ larger patient cohorts, more discriminatory analyses, and a less equivocal clinical phenotype.",M1
20001084,"Procrustean rotation in concert with principal component analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories: Quantifying global and local differences between conformational samples.Given the principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) of a molecular dynamics (MD) conformational trajectory for a model protein, we perform orthogonal Procrustean rotation to  best fit  the PCA squared-loading matrix to that of a target matrix computed for a related but different molecular system. The sum of squared deviations of the elements of the rotated matrix from those of the target, known as the error of fit (EOF), provides a quantitative measure of the dissimilarity between the two conformational samples. To estimate precision of the EOF, we perform bootstrap resampling of the molecular conformations within the trajectories, generating a distribution of EOF values for the system and target. The average EOF per variable is determined and visualized to ascertain where, locally, system and target sample properties differ. We illustrate this approach by analyzing MD trajectories for the wild-type and four selected mutants of the beta1 domain of protein G.",M1
19995583,"Current source density (CSD) old/new effects during recognition memory for words and faces in schizophrenia and in healthy adults.We previously reported a preserved 'old-new effect' (enhanced parietal positivity 300-800 ms following correctly-recognized repeated words) in schizophrenia over mid-parietal sites using 31-channel nose-referenced event-related potentials (ERP) and reference-free current source densities (CSD). However, patients showed poorer word recognition memory and reduced left lateral-parietal P3 sources. The present study investigated whether these abnormalities are specific to words. High-density ERPs (67 channels) were recorded from 57 schizophrenic (24 females) and 44 healthy (26 females) right-handed adults during parallel visual continuous recognition memory tasks using common words or unknown faces. To identify and measure neuronal generator patterns underlying ERPs, unrestricted Varimax-<e>PCA</e> was performed using CSD estimates (spherical spline surface Laplacian). Two late source factors peaking at 442 ms (lateral parietal maximum) and 723 ms (centroparietal maximum) accounted for most of the variance between 250 and 850 ms. Poorer (76.6+/-20.0% vs. 85.7+/-12.4% correct) and slower (824+/-170 vs. 755+/-147 ms) performance in patients was accompanied by reduced stimulus-locked parietal sources. However, both controls and patients showed mid-frontal (442 ms) and left parietal (723 ms) old/new effects in both tasks. Whereas mid-frontal old/new effects were comparable across groups and tasks, later left parietal old/new effects were markedly reduced in patients over lateral temporoparietal but not mid-parietal sites, particularly for words, implicating impaired phonological processing. In agreement with prior results, ERP correlates of recognition memory deficits in schizophrenia suggest functional impairments of lateral posterior cortex (stimulus representation) associated with conscious recollection. This deficit was more pronounced for common words despite a greater difficulty to recall unknown faces, indicating that it is not due to a generalized cognitive deficit in schizophrenia.",M1

19965003,"Extraction of color features in the spectral domain to recognize centroblasts in histopathology.In this paper, we are proposing a novel automated method to recognize centroblast (CB) cells from non-centroblast (non-CB) cells for computer-assisted evaluation of follicular lymphoma tissue samples. The method is based on training and testing of a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier. The novel aspects of this method are the identification of the CB object with prior information, and the introduction of the principal component analysis (<e>PCA</e>) in the spectral domain to extract color texture features. Both geometric and texture features are used to achieve the classification. Experimental results on real follicular lymphoma images demonstrate that the combined feature space improved the performance of the system significantly. The implemented method can identify centroblast cells (CB) from non-centroblast cells (non-CB) with a classification accuracy of 82.56%.",M1
19964869,"<e>PCA</e> vs. tensor-based dimension reduction methods: An empirical comparison on active shape models of organs.How to model shape variations plays an important role in active shape models that is widely used in model-based medical image segmentation, and principal component analysis is a common approach for this task. Recently, different tensor-based dimension reduction methods have been proposed and have achieved better performances than PCA in face recognition. However, how they perform in modeling 3D shape variations of organs in terms of reconstruction errors in medical image analysis is still unclear. In this paper, we propose to use tensor-based dimension reduction methods to model shape variations. We empirically compare two-dimensional principal component analysis, the parallel factor model and the Tucker decomposition with PCA in terms of the reconstruction errors. From our experimental results on several different organs such as livers, spleens and kidneys, 2DPCA performs best among the four compared methods, and the performance differences between 2DPCA and the other methods are statistically significant.",M1
19964826,"Multivariate analysis of intracranial pressure (ICP) signal using principal component analysis.The diagnosis and treatment of hydrocephalus and other neurological disorders often involve the acquisition and analysis of large amount of intracranial pressure (ICP) signal. Although the analysis and subsequent interpretation of this data is an essential part of the clinical management of the disorders, it is typically done manually by a trained clinician, and the difficulty in interpreting some of the features of this complex time series can sometimes lead to issues of subjectivity and reliability. This paper presents a method for the quantitative analysis of this data using a multivariate approach based on principal component analysis, with the aim of optimising symptom diagnosis, patient characterisation and treatment simulation and personalisation. In this method, 10 features are extracted from the ICP signal and principal components that represent these features are defined and analysed. Results from ICP traces of 40 patients show that the chosen features have relevant information about the ICP signal and can be represented with a few components of the <e>PCA</e> (approximately 91% of the total variance of the data is represented by the first four components of the PCA) and that these components can be helpful in characterising subgroups in the patient population that would otherwise not have been apparent. The introduction of supplementaty (non-ICP) variables has offered insight into additional groupings and relationships which may prove to be a fruitful avenue for exploration.",M1
19964659,"Bio-inspired controller for a dexterous prosthetic hand based on Principal Components Analysis.Controlling a dexterous myoelectric prosthetic hand with many degrees of freedom (DoFs) could be a very demanding task, which requires the amputee for high concentration and ability in modulating many different muscular contraction signals. In this work a new approach to multi-DoF control is proposed, which makes use of Principal Component Analysis (<e>PCA</e>) to reduce the DoFs space dimensionality and allow to drive a 15 DoFs hand by means of a 2 DoFs signal. This approach has been tested and properly adapted to work onto the underactuated robotic hand named CyberHand, using mouse cursor coordinates as input signals and a principal components (PCs) matrix taken from the literature. First trials show the feasibility of performing grasps using this method. Further tests with real EMG signals are foreseen.",M1

Nevertheless, classification with TFR is not straightforward given their large dimension and redundancy. In this paper we compare several methodologies to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to TFR as a dimensional reduction scheme, which differ in the form that features are represented. Besides, we propose a method which maximizes information among TFR preserving information within TFRs. Results show that the methodologies that represent TFRs as matrices improve discrimination of heart murmurs, and that the proposed methodology shrinks variability of the results.",M1
19964138,"Fast <e>PCA</e> via UTV decomposition and application on EEG analysis.In the mean square error sense, principal component analysis (PCA) or Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) can optimally summarize the high dimensional data into only a few meaningful ones. However, for the biomedical signal analysis, e.g. electroencephalogram (EEG), the data need to be updated or downdated very often. This fact makes the PCA impractical to be employed, especially in real-time signal analysis. In this paper, we propose the fast computational method for approximating the PCA such that the new transform, called fast PCA (fastPCA), can easily be updated and downdated. The fastPCA is calculated via the UTV decomposition which is the method normally used to approximate the rank-revealing property of the singular value decomposition (SVD). The merit of the fastPCA is also illustrated via the application on EEG analysis.",M1
20102092,"Visual evoked response in patients with severe carotid disease--functional transcranial doppler study of posterior circulation.The goal of this study was to evaluate the visual evoked response in posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) by means of functional transcranial doppler in patients with severe carotid disease and to determine the hemodynamic effect of severe carotid disease on posterior circulation. Measurements were performed successively in the dark and during the white light stimulation in 49 patients with high-grade (70-99%) internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion and compared with 30 healthy age and sex matched subjects. Mean blood flow velocities (MBFV) (cm/s +/- 2SD) and mean reaction time (MRT) (s +/- 2SD) during three consecutive repetitive periods of 1 minute each were analyzed. MBFV in PCA during the white light stimulation and in the dark between the two groups didn't differ. MRT in patients showed a significantly prolonged visual evoked response in both affected (light: patients 29.36 +/- 14.46, controls 19.67 +/- 11.25, respectively, p &lt; 0.046; dark: patients 35.25 +/- 11.9 controls 21.89 +/- 10.31, respectively, p &lt; 0.002 and unaffected side (dark: patients 33.13 +/- 11.12, controls 23.89 +/- 11.23, respectively, p &lt; 0.032) of ICA. This data showed that MRT is the principal restrictive factor in the case of carotid stenosis suggesting the independence of cerebral vascular reserve capacity of the posterior part of Willis circle that is necessary to be considered separately.",M2
19935435,"Deep bypasses to the distal posterior circulation: anatomical and clinical comparison of pretemporal and subtemporal approaches.OBJECTIVE: The subtemporal approach for a superficial temporal artery-to-superior cerebellar artery bypass requires significant superior retraction that can injure the temporal lobe, compromise veins, and cause edema postoperatively. In contrast, the pretemporal approach requires posterolateral retraction that seems to be less injurious to the temporal lobe and better tolerated clinically. We hypothesized that the pretemporal approach provides ample exposure, more gentle retraction, and better clinical results than the subtemporal approach. METHODS: Standard orbitozygomatic-pterional and subtemporal approaches were performed on both sides of 4 formalin-fixed cadaver heads for morphometric measurements. Temporal lobe retraction was quantified for each approach in terms of brain shift and retraction pressure by using both sides of 3 fresh, unfixed cadaver heads. Similar morphometric measurements were made in 14 patients in whom bypasses to the distal posterior circulation were performed. The effect of temporal lobe retraction was assessed with edema volumes on postoperative computed tomography scans. RESULTS: In cadaver heads and in patients, the pretemporal approach optimized exposure of the P2A segment of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) and the subtemporal approach optimized exposure of the lateral pontomesencephalic segment of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Working depths and lengths of exposed artery were similar with these 2 approaches, but the PCA was a larger recipient than the SCA. Brain shift was 42% less with pretemporal than with subtemporal retraction, and retraction pressure was 43% less with pretemporal than with subtemporal retraction. The volume of temporal lobe edema was 56% less in patients with bypasses performed with the pretemporal approach as compared with the subtemporal approach. CONCLUSION: Pretemporal exposure of the PCA is equivalent to subtemporal exposure of the SCA, but the pretemporal approach is facilitated by a larger recipient artery. Posterolateral temporal lobe retraction associated with the pretemporal approach is gentler than superior retraction with the subtemporal approach. These results validate our preference for the pretemporal approach over the subtemporal approach when performing deep bypasses to the posterior circulation.",M2
19894294,"[Ischemic stroke due to isolated spontaneous posterior cerebral artery dissection in young adults]Twelve patients (9 women, 3 men, mean age 26.8 +/- 5.02 years) with spontaneous isolated dissection of posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) were studied. Eleven patients (92%) developed ischemic stroke, 1 patient (8%)--transient ischemic attack (TIA). All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): 9 patients--a follow-up MRA, 3 patients--a single study. Local neurological symptoms (hemianopia, hemianestesia) developed suddenly (75%) during everyday patient's activity (83%) and were combined with headache on the side of dissection in 75% of patients. The main provoked factor was alcohol (67%), 25% had preceding respiratory infection. The initial cerebral angiography carried out in most cases within the first month of stroke demonstrated the occlusion (33%) or stenosis (67%) of PCA. The repeat MRA carried out on 2-3 months or more showed the improvement or normalization of blood flow in PCA (89%). In 1 (11%) patient the occlusive process progressed that correlated with headache increasing. A single MRA carried out in 48 days--6 months (3 patients) found the prolonged irregular stenosis (1), occlusion at P2 segment (1) and normal PCA appearance (1). At the whole, the prolonged irregular stenosis at least in one study, was found in a half of patients. None of patients had atherosclerosis, vasculitis, arterial hypertension or thrombophilia. Clinical manifestations of connective tissue weakness were seen in 67% of patients, hypotonia--in 67%, headache in the past history--in 67% and mitral valve prolapse--in 75%. In conclusion, spontaneous isolated dissection of PCA is one of the causes of ischemic stroke in young adults. The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical manifestations and follow-up MRA. The development of dissection appears to be connected with arterial wall weakness.",M2
19875474,"Fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery produces left-right asymmetry on perfusion imaging.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fetal origin of the <e>PCA</e> is a common anatomic variation of the circle of Willis. On perfusion imaging, patients with unilateral fetal-type PCA may demonstrate left-right asymmetry that could mimic cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between a fetal-type PCA and asymmetry of hemodynamic parameters derived from MR perfusion imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR perfusion studies of 36 patients to determine the relationship between hemodynamic and vascular asymmetries in the PCA territory. Perfusion asymmetry indices for the PCA territory were computed from maps of rCBF, rCBV, MTT, T(max), and FMT. Vascular asymmetry indices were derived from calibers of the PCA-P1 segments relative to the posterior communicating arteries. RESULTS: Asymmetrically smaller values of FMT and T(max) were observed with unilateral fetal-type PCA, and these were strongly correlated with the degree of vascular asymmetry (Spearman's rho = 0.76 and 0.74, respectively, P &lt; 1 x 10(-6)). Asymmetries of rCBF, MTT, and rCBV were neither significant nor related to vascular asymmetry. CONCLUSIONS: Faster perfusion transit times are seen for parameters sensitive to macrovascular transit effects (eg, FMT and T(max)) ipsilateral to fetal origin of the PCA in proportion to the degree of arterial asymmetry. Knowledge of this normal variation is critical in the interpretation of perfusion studies because asymmetry could mimic cerebrovascular pathology.",M2
19767537,"Resistance artery adaptation to pregnancy counteracts the vasoconstricting influence of plasma from normal pregnant women.Using a rat model, we investigated the effects of circulating factors in pregnancy on cerebrovascular and systemic vascular function by comparing myogenic reactivity, tone, and endothelial vasodilator production of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) and mesenteric artery (MA) of nonpregnant (NP) animals perfused with nonpregnant and pregnant human plasma. Arteries from late pregnant (LP) animals were then perfused similarly to evaluate a potential adaptive effect of pregnancy on vessel function. A 3-hour exposure to pregnant plasma caused increased myogenic reactivity and tone in vessels from NP animals and produced a decreased endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor response in NP PCAs, findings that were not seen with MAs. The increased reactivity and tone noted in NP vessels was abolished when pregnant plasma was perfused through LP arteries, suggesting these vessels adapt during pregnancy to the vasoconstricting influence of pregnant plasma.",M2

19622882,"Posterior cerebral artery infarction: diffusion-weighted MRI analysis of 205 patients.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although cardiac embolism has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) territory infarction, intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease may play a more important role in regions where intracranial diseases are prevalent. We aimed to assess the etiologies and stroke pattern of PCA territory infarction in a Korean population. METHOD: We reviewed consecutive patients with acute PCA territory infarction who underwent diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) within 7 days after onset. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients (male 56%, mean age 65.4 +/- 12.4 years) were recruited. 'Superficial', 'deep' and 'superficial plus deep' infarcts accounted for 26.3, 47.8 and 25.9% of infarcts, respectively. There were 126 patients who had infarcts limited to the PCA territory, whereas 79 patients had concomitant infarcts in other territories. Large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Among the 87 patients with LAA, 38 had intrinsic PCA disease without atherosclerosis in the proximal vessels. In these patients, stroke mechanisms included atheromatous branch occlusion (n = 19), in situ thrombotic occlusion (n = 11) and artery-to-artery embolism (n = 8). While the occipital area was the most frequently involved in general, the ventrolateral thalamic area was more frequently involved than the occipital area in patients with intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease. CONCLUSION: The patterns of PCA territory infarction are different according to underlying etiologies. In our population, intrinsic atherosclerotic disease is a relatively important cause of PCA territory infarction that produces strokes through a variety of mechanisms.",M2
19602876,"Clinical significance of posterior circulation changes after revascularization in patients with moyamoya disease.OBJECTIVE: It has been noted that the posterior circulation serves as an important source of collateral blood supply in moyamoya disease. Since most of the literature has focused on non-operative cases and many symptomatic patients receive surgical revascularization, we evaluated the posterior circulation changes after revascularization and found that progressive posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) steno-occlusive changes after revascularization caused cerebral hemodynamic compromise and clinical deterioration in a significant portion of patients. METHODS: Twenty-three moyamoya disease patients with ischemic presentation who received revascularization with complete angiography and xenon CT during a minimum of 3 years' clinical follow-up were enrolled. Revascularization was performed in 38 hemispheres. Pre- and postoperative angiography were reviewed to determine the internal carotid artery (ICA) stage, PCA stage, leptomeningeal collateral (LMC) grade, and Matsushima synangiosis grade. The postoperative regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) were recorded and correlated with angiographic findings and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Progression of ICA staging was noted in 23 sides (55.2%), and progression of PCA staging was noted in 18 sides (47.4%). Among the 18 cases of PCA stage progression, an associated decrease in LMC grade was noted in 12 sides (66.7%). These changes were associated with decreased regional CBF and CVR, which also explained the recurrent ischemic symptoms in 27.8% of these patients. In contrast, LMC grade increased in 15 (65.2%) sides of patients with ICA progression. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive steno-occlusive change in the PCA after revascularization is associated with a reduction in LMC blood flow and cerebral ischemia in moyamoya patients. This phenomenon might cause recurrent ischemic symptoms in 27.8% of patients.",M2
19394757,"Flow volume and cross-sectional area of the extracranial vertebral arteries and its relation to vascular lesions or anatomical variations in the posterior circulation.We examined whether the time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV), flow volume (FV) or cross-sectional area (CA) in the vertebral arteries (VA) as determined by ultrasonography was related to vascular lesions or variations in the intracranial part of the posterior circulation. Three hundred nine patients without severe stenosis in the carotid circulation (159 males, 150 females, mean age of 69.1 years) underwent both colour duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and were thus analyzed. According to the MRA findings, the patients were divided as follows; 22 patients with severe stenosis in the bilateral <e>PCA</e> or VA or basilar artery (V group) and 287 patients without (N group). The N group was then further divided as follows; 144 patients with no (P0 group); 89 with one (P1) and 54 with both posterior communicating arteries (P2) detected on MRA. TAMV, FV and CA were compared among these groups. Both TAMV and FV of V group were significantly lower than those of N group (35.3 vs. 42.6 cm/sec in TAMV, 98.2 vs. 135.3 mL/min in FV, p &lt; 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively). The FVs and CAs in the P0 through P2 groups were all significantly different according to the number of posterior communicating arteries (149.3 vs. 128.0 vs. 109.8 mL/min, 22.5 vs. 20.2 vs. 16.5 mm2, both p &lt; 0.001) while TAMVs in these groups did not differ substantially. The FV in both VAs were thus found to be related to the vascular lesions or variations in the posterior circulation.",M2
19390177,"Digital probabilistic atlas of the border region between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of external borderzone infarction is made when the stroke is located at the border between the arterial territories. Recent studies have raised questions regarding the location of this borderzone given the variability in the arterial territories. We examined the location of this region using a digital approach and its correspondence with the 'traditional' template. METHODS: Infarcts resulting from occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) or posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) trunk or branches were segmented from T(2)-weighted MR images and linearly registered into a common stereotaxic coordinate space. For MCA infarcts and PCA infarcts, maps of voxels in a rim surrounding the infarct were created. The maps of individual rims were averaged to create images of the probability of each voxel lying in the MCA and PCA rims. The MCA and PCA rims were used to create a digital atlas of the probability of each voxel lying concurrently in both rims. RESULTS: The MCA group consisted of 36 patients (16 males) with a median age of 73 (range 25-87) years. The PCA territory group consisted of 30 patients (24 males) with a median age of 61 (range 22-86) years. The probability of involvement in the digital atlas was higher in the posterior putamen (probability 0.12-0.29) and optic tract (probability 0.13-0.0.20) than in the angular gyrus (probability 0.01). CONCLUSION: We have created a digital model of the border region between the MCA and PCA territories.

19359628,"Autoregulation in the posterior circulation is altered by the metabolic state of the visual cortex.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that dynamic autoregulation in the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) is less efficient compared to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We examined the role of cerebral vasodilation caused by metabolic activation (ie, visual stimulus) on autoregulatory characteristics in the 2 vascular territories. METHODS: Blood flow velocity in the PCA and MCA and mean arterial pressure were measured continuously in 45 healthy volunteers (62+/-3 years) while seated with eyes open. Additional 20 subjects (60+/-5 years) were examined with eyes closed and open. Autoregulation was assessed using transfer function gains in both the PCA and MCA territories in the low (0.03-0.07 Hz), high (0.07-0.15 Hz), and cardiac (approximately 1 Hz) frequency ranges. RESULTS: With eyes open, gains were significantly higher in the PCA compared to the MCA in the low (PCA: 1.41+/-0.09 vs MCA: 1.18+/-0.07; P=0.003) and high (PCA: 2.06+/-0.12 vs MCA: 1.61+/-0.08; P=0.0001) frequencies. Opening eyes increased blood flow velocity and reduced cerebrovascular resistance index in the PCA but not in MCA. This vasodilation in the PCA was associated with increased gain in the low (autoregulatory) frequency, whereas MCA gain did not change (PCA: 0.89+/-0.14 vs 1.31+/-0.17, MCA: 1.24+/-0.16 vs 1.16+/-0.11; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Dilation of the PCA territory during visual cortex activation resulted in increased PCA transfer function gain without changing MCA gain. Thus, impaired autoregulation in the PCA reported in previous literature is likely the result of metabolic vasodilation and not an inherent difference in the autoregulatory characteristics of the posterior circulation.",M2
19345592,"Extracranial and transcranial ultrasound assessment in patients with suspected positional 'vertebrobasilar ischaemia'.OBJECTIVES: A diagnosis of 'positional' vertebrobasilar ischaemia is considered in patients presenting with dizziness/vertigo during lateral neck rotation/extension and is attributed to bony 'nipping' of the vertebral artery (VA). This study reviewed our experience with extracranial and transcranial ultrasound to determine whether a diagnosis of 'positional' vertebrobasilar ischaemia was associated with any changes in flow in the extracranial VA and the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) during head turning. METHODS: A retrospective case note review was undertaken in 46 patients with an accessible window for transcranial Doppler who had undergone extracranial and transcranial assessment of flow velocity and flow directionality in the VA and PCA while the head was moved into positions that normally triggered the patient's symptoms. RESULTS: Positional 'vertebrobasilar symptoms' were triggered by lateral head rotation in 35 patients (76%), while 11 (24%) developed symptoms following neck extension. Only one patient was found to have a significant carotid stenosis (symptoms unchanged following carotid endarterectomy) and none had significant disease in the extracranial VAs. None of the patients exhibited any change in extracranial VA flow during head turning/extension and none had reversal of flow either. Similarly, there was no change observed in the PCA flow characteristics during head turning. The majority of patients (74%) were subsequently referred to the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department, and 94% of the patients noted an improvement in symptoms following entry into a vestibular rehabilitation programme. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of 'positional' vertebrobasilar ischaemia should be made with extreme caution and only after a specialist assessment in a Balance Centre.",M2

A unique case of a complete loop of the posterior cerebral artery associated with a ruptured aneurysm is presented. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman with a subarachnoid hemorrhage in World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade IV was diagnosed with a loop of the right PCA with an aneurysm at the apex of the loop. At surgery, the aneurysm was found to arise at the origin of the MPChA and it was clipped. Three months later, after improving to Glasgow Outcome Scale 3, the patient died of unrelated cause. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, a complete loop of the PCA associated with an aneurysm at the origin of the MPChA has never been described. Microneurosurgical approach via subtemporal craniotomy was safe and effective in displaying the anomalous anatomy and allowing perfect clipping of the aneurysm.",M2
19145147,"Additional surgery for postoperative ischemic symptoms in patients with moyamoya disease: the effectiveness of occipital artery-posterior cerebral artery bypass with an indirect procedure: technical case report.OBJECTIVE: In patients with moyamoya disease, surgery to revascularize the ischemic brain is a recommended treatment. However, there are a few patients who require additional revascularization surgery because of progression of the disease. Even patients who show no postoperative ischemic symptoms at first may experience late deterioration. We performed additional surgery for such lesions using occipital artery (OA)-posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) bypass with indirect revascularization. The efficacy of the procedure is reported. METHODS: We treated 3 patients with moyamoya disease who showed a transient ischemic attack after revascularization surgery. Three female patients, ranging in age from 6.0 to 35.2 years (mean age, 23.8 years) at the time of surgery, with ischemic symptoms (leg monoparesis in 2, visual impairment in 1) underwent the additional revascularization procedure. Preoperatively, all patients underwent indirect and/or direct revascularization surgery for initial treatment. All patients showed progression of the disease, especially in the PCA. OA-PCA bypass with encephalogaleodurosynangiosis and burr hole surgery were performed for postoperative ischemic symptoms. RESULTS: All patients showed clinical and radiological improvement. The transient ischemic attack was improved in all 3 patients. They did not complain of transient ischemic attack in the recent follow-up period. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no additional cerebral infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography showed widening of the OA and development of peripheral collateral vessels. Postoperative single-photon emission computed tomographic studies showed marked increase of uptake in both anterior cerebral artery and PCA territories. Cerebral vasodilatory capacity evaluated by an acetazolamide test also showed marked improvement. One patient showed postoperative cerebral edema as a result of focal cerebral hyperperfusion. CONCLUSION: OA-PCA anastomosis with indirect revascularization was effective for postoperative ischemia that showed symptoms in the anterior cerebral artery and PCA territories as a result of progression of a PCA lesion.",M2
19066012,"Subtemporal approach to basilar tip aneurysm with division of posterior communicating artery: technical note.The subtemporal approach with division of the posterior communicating artery (PcomA) is described for treating aneurysms of the basilar tip. When the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) interferes with visibility and manipulation around the aneurysm neck and the artery is tethered by the PcomA and not mobilized, the PcomA can be divided near the junction with the PCA. The procedure permits PCA mobilization and exposes the neck of the aneurysm. We applied this procedure to a patient with a ruptured aneurysm of the basilar tip. The postoperative course was uneventful except for transient left oculomotor nerve palsy. Postoperative cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the respective disappearance of the aneurysm and no new ischemic lesions. The subtemporal approach allows safer and easier division of the PcomA near the junction to the PCA compared with the pterional approach, and the present procedure is more suitable for the subtemporal approach.",M2
18955685,"Impaired visual evoked flow velocity response in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.OBJECTIVE: Animal models of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) exhibit abnormal vascular reactivity. We determined whether vascular reactivity, measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), is reduced in humans with CAA. METHODS: Cases were recruited from an established prospective study of CAA. Healthy controls were recruited from a study of normal aging. Evoked mean flow velocity increase in the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) was measured while subjects viewed a flashing alternating checkerboard stimulus. In a separate but partially overlapping cohort we measured the mean flow velocity increase in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) while subjects inhaled carbon dioxide. RESULTS: The visual evoked mean flow velocity increase was 8.0 +/- 6.1% in CAA (n = 11) compared to 17.4 +/- 5.7% in controls (n = 9, p = 0.002). The PCA pulsatility index, a marker of distal vascular resistance, was higher in CAA (CAA 1.35 +/- 0.35, control 1.04 +/- 0.14, p = 0.03). Among CAA subjects, lower visual evoked mean flow velocity increase was associated with a higher number of hemorrhages seen on MRI (r = -0.87, p = 0.0005) and higher MRI white matter hyperintensity volume (r = -0.67, p = 0.02). The MCA response to carbon dioxide did not differ between CAA and control in 20 subjects (9 CAA, 11 control, p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was associated with decreased vascular reactivity in response to visual stimulation, possibly reflecting the occipital predilection of the disease. The association of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) evoked flow velocity response with elevated PCA pulsatility index and MRI markers of small vessel disease suggests that abnormal PCA evoked flow velocity in CAA is caused by pathology of the distal resistance vessels.",M2
18845379,"The visually-evoked cerebral blood flow response in women with a recent history of preeclampsia and/or eclampsia.Several studies provide evidence for altered cerebral hemodynamics during (pre)eclampsia. Whether (pre)eclampsia has a persistent negative impact on cerebral hemodynamics, possibly contributing to an elevated risk of premature stroke, is unknown. The aims of this study were (i) to refine and apply a control system-based method previously introduced by Rosengarten to quantify the visually-evoked blood flow response of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>); and (ii) to test the hypothesis with this method that cerebral hemodynamics in women with a recent history of (pre)eclampsia is abnormal relative to that in parous controls. Hereto, we recorded cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the PCA by transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography during cyclic visual stimulation in 15 former preeclamptics, 13 former eclamptics and 13 controls. The typical CBFV response was fitted with the step response of a second-order-linear model enabling quantification by parameters K (gain), zeta (damping), omega (natural frequency), T(v) (rate time) and T(d) (time delay). The method refinement introduced here consisted of response filtering before quantification and of considering the individual instead of group-averaged response patterns. Application of this refinement reduced the fitting errors (1.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.2 +/- 1.8, p &lt; 0.01). Intergroup differences in model parameters were not found. Although statistically not significant, a trend was observed that critical damping (zeta&gt;1) occurred more frequently in the combined group of former patients than in the controls (7 of 28 vs.1 of 13, p = 0.16). Critical damping (zeta&gt;1) reflects an abnormal response, which is either compensated for by a rise in rate time ( intermediate ; zeta&gt;1; T(v) &gt; 20) or remains uncompensated ( sluggish ; zeta&gt;1; T(v) &lt; 20). Critical damping increased significantly (p = 0.039) with (pre-)eclampsia-to-test-interval in the PE+E patients with abnormal responses (zeta&gt;1), suggesting that (pre)eclampsia might induce diminishing cerebral hemodynamic function over time. Based on a system-analytical classification approach, the data of this study provide evidence for individual CBFV responses to be abnormal in former (pre)eclamptics compared with controls. Further study is needed to reveal how the abnormal CBFV response classification reflects cerebrovascular dysfunction.",M2
18728604,"Internal carotid artery aneurysms occurring at the origin of fetal variant posterior cerebral arteries: surgical and endovascular experience.OBJECTIVE: A fetal variant posterior cerebral artery (fetal <e>PCA</e>) is an embryological remnant in which the PCA is primarily supplied via the anterior cerebral circulation. Internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms originating from the takeoff of fetal PCA vessels deserve special attention before surgical or endovascular obliteration because of a greater potential for ischemic injury. We present the first series of ICA-posterior communicating artery (PComA) aneurysms originating at the takeoff of fetal PCA vessels that were treated by surgical or endovascular intervention. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients who underwent surgical and endovascular treatment of an ICA-PComA aneurysm at Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center during a 15-year period (1991-2006) to identify cases with aneurysms originating from fetal variant PCAs. Data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: During a 15-year period, 271 patients were treated for 273 ICA-PComA aneurysms. Aneurysms occurring at the origin of fetal PCAs were identified in 30 patients (11%). There were 23 women (77%) and seven men (23%) (sex difference, P = 0.0035). Twenty-four patients underwent surgical clipping, whereas six patients underwent endovascular coiling. The mean aneurysm size was 7 mm. The mean ischemia time with temporary clipping (12 cases) was 4.5 minutes. Intraoperative rupture occurred in four surgical cases (17%). Postoperative angiography demonstrated occlusion of the fetal PCA in one case after clip ligation (3%), with an ensuing occipital infarct yet no clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: ICA-PComA aneurysms originating from fetal PCA vessels may pose a more substantial risk for infarction and subsequent neurological sequelae with surgical or endovascular obliteration. Fetal variant circulations were identified at the PComA origin in 11% of ICA-PComA aneurysm patients and were more commonly encountered in women. The decision of surgical versus endovascular treatment of fetal PCA aneurysms must be carefully considered, given the greater potential for ischemic injury with parent vessel occlusion.",M2
18773233,"Proximal STA to proximal <e>PCA</e> bypass using a radial artery graft by posterior oblique transzygomatic subtemporal approach.The aim of the present study was to investigate the use of a radial artery graft (RAG) for bypass of the proximal superficial temporal artery (STA) to proximal posterior cerebral artery (PCA) by posterior oblique transzygomatic subtemporal approach as an alternative to the external carotid artery (ECA) to PCA anastomosis. We conducted an anatomical and technical study at a university hospital. Five adult cadaveric specimens were dissected. A preauricular vertical skin incision was used. The trunk of STA was identified. A 30 degrees oblique posterior zygomatic arch osteotomy and microcraniotomy was performed. The dura of the middle cranial fossa was then opened. The temporal lobe was retracted, the interpeduncular and ambient cisterns were opened, and the P2 segment of the PCA was exposed. The proximal side of the RAG was anastomosed with the proximal STA and the distal side was anastomosed with the P2 segment. The mean caliber of the proximal STA was 2.25 +/- 0.35 mm. The mean diameter of the P(2) was 2.2 +/- 0.2 mm. The average length of the RAG was 56 +/- 3.2 mm. The mean caliber of the proximal and the distal sides of the graft was 2.5 +/- 0.25 mm and 2.3 +/- 0.15 mm, respectively. Because the proximal STA to proximal PCA bypass uses a short RAG and their calibers are over 2 mm, this bypass technique can provide a sufficient blood flow and may be a reasonable alternative over ECA to PCA bypass using long grafts.",M2
18514275,"Modified abbreviated transcavernous approach to basilar artery aneurysms--case report.BACKGROUND: Endovascular procedures and direct surgical clipping are the main therapeutic modalities for managing of BAAs. Furthermore, giant or wide-necked aneurysms and those that involve the <e>PCA</e> or perforators at its neck usually are not embolized. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old man presented to the emergency room complaining of sudden and intense headache. Neurological examination evidenced meningismus. Computed tomography disclosed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (Fisher grade III). Arteriograms revealed BAA, whose neck was partially obscured by the PCP. A standard pterional craniotomy was performed, followed by extensive drilling of the greater sphenoid wing. The neck was partially hidden by the PCP, and no proximal control was obtained without drilling the PCP and opening the CS (modified TcA). Drilling of the PCP was begun by cutting the overlying dura and extended caudally as much as possible. Next, opening of the roof of the CS was performed by incising the dura in the oculomotor trigone medial and parallel to the oculomotor nerve and lateral to ICA; the incision progressed posteriorly toward the dorsum sellae. Further resection of the dorsum sellae and clivus was carried out. After performing these steps, proximal control was obtained, aneurysm was deflated, perforators were saved, and aneurysm was clipped. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the clinical usefulness of an abbreviated form of the TcA, which led the  modified TcA,  in approaching complex low-lying BAA. It provides additional surgical room by removing the PCP and partially opening the CS, which permits further bone removal and improves exposure.",M2
18497348,"The influence of pregnancy and gender on perivascular innervation of rat posterior cerebral arteries.The authors investigated the influence of pregnancy and gender on the density of trigeminal and sympathetic perivascular nerves in posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>) and the reactivity to norepinephrine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). PCAs were isolated from nonpregnant, late-pregnant, postpartum, and male rats, mounted and pressurized on an arteriograph chamber to obtain concentration-response curves to norepinephrine and CGRP. Arteries were immunostained for CGRP-, tyrosine hydroxylase-, and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-containing perivascular nerves, and nerve density was determined morphologically. Pregnancy had a trophic effect on trigeminal perivascular innervation (P &lt; .01 vs male); however, this was not accompanied by a change in reactivity to CGRP. Sympathetic and PGP 9.5 nerve densities were not altered by pregnancy or gender, and there were no differences in reactivity to norepinephrine. Together, these results suggest that the increase in trigeminal innervation during pregnancy is more related to nociception than in controlling resting cerebral blood flow.",M2
18469674,"Neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery infarction.BACKGROUND: The role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. On occasion, however, hemiparesis and/or visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction that would warrant thrombolytic therapy. REVIEW SUMMARY: As neuroimaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke in the thrombolytic era, a series of case studies is presented to illustrate the role of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the setting of acute PCA infarction. CONCLUSION: Familiarity with the neuroimaging features of acute PCA infarction can facilitate management in those select patients that qualify for thrombolytic therapy.",M2
18468457,"Quantitative evaluation of hemodynamic response after hypercapnia among different brain territories by fMRI.The brain vascular system has an autoregulatory mechanism that maintains blood perfusion within normal limits at the capillary level. Partially due to its clinical importance, it is of interest to better understand the mechanisms involved in vascular regulation. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we quantitatively investigated hemodynamic response characteristics of regions supplied by the main cerebral arteries, during two breath holding tests (BHT): after inspiration and after expiration. We used an auto-regressive method capable of estimating four signal parameters: onset delay, full width at half maximum (FWHM), time-to-peak and amplitude. The onset delay was significantly longer for the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) than for middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior arteries (ACA). FWHM and time-to-peak were larger in the ACA territory, indicating a slower blood flow in this region. Differences were also observed in the amplitude among the three areas, where MCA and PCA territories showed the smallest and the highest amplitudes, respectively. Moreover, differences were found in amplitude and onset when BHT was performed after inspiration as compared to BHT after expiration. Time-to-peak and FWHM showed no statistical differences between these two challenges. Such results are related to regional anatomical specificities and biochemical mechanisms responsible for vasodilation, such as those related to vascularity and vessel sizes.",M2
18440610,"Parent vessel occlusion for P2 dissecting aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery.BACKGROUND: Dissecting aneurysms of the <e>PCA</e> are difficult to treat with preservation of the parent arteries. We report the clinical and angiographic outcome for 8 patients with dissecting aneurysms located at the P2 segment of the PCA. METHODS: In the past 5 years, 8 patients, 2 female and 6 male, presented to our institution with P2 dissecting aneurysms of the PCA and were treated endovascularly. The age of our patients ranged from 4 to 58 years, with a mean age of 34.4. Of the 8 patients, 5 had subarachnoid and/or intracerebral hemorrhage upon presentation. Two patients with P2 dissecting aneurysms presented with mild hemiparesis and hypoesthesia; 1 patient with a large dissecting aneurysm complained of headaches. RESULTS: Eight patients with P2 aneurysms of the PCA underwent PVO. Parent vessel occlusions were performed with detachable coils. No patient developed neurologic deficits. CONCLUSION: P2 dissecting aneurysms can be treated with PVO in the cases in which selective embolization of the aneurismal sac with detachable platinum coils or surgical clipping cannot be achieved.",M2
18387547,"Cerebral blood flow regulation during cognitive tasks: effects of healthy aging.Aging is associated with frontal subcortical microangiopathy and executive cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that elderly individuals may have impaired metabolic activation of cerebral blood flow to the frontal lobes. We used transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to examine the cerebral blood flow response to executive control and visual tasks in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations and to determine the effects of healthy aging on cerebral blood flow regulation during cognitive tasks. Continuous simultaneous anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) blood flow velocities (BFVs) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured in response to word stem completion (WSC) and a visual search (VS) task in 29 healthy subjects (14 young, 30+/-1.5 years; 15 old, 74+/-1.4 years). We found that: (1) ACA and PCA blood flow velocities are both significantly increased during WSC and VS cognitive tasks, (2) ACA and PCA activations were task specific in our young volunteers, with ACA&gt;PCA BFV during the WSC task and PCA&gt;ACA BFV during the VS task, (3) while healthy elderly subjects also had PCA&gt;ACA BFV during the VS task, they did not have ACA&gt;PCA activation during the WSC task, and (4) healthy elderly subjects tend to have overall greater increases in BFV during both cognitive tasks. We conclude that TCD can be used to monitor cerebrovascular hemodynamics during the performance of cognitive tasks. Our data suggest that there is differential blood flow increase in the ACA and PCA in young versus elderly subjects during cognitive tasks.",M2
18274809,"Is a fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery a risk factor for TIA or ischemic stroke? A study with 16-multidetector-row CT angiography.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) is not uncommon. Whether patients with this anomaly have a higher risk of ischemic stroke in the territory of the PCA is not known. The clinical benefit of screening for a fetal origin in patients with TIA or stroke in the territory of the PCA and an ipsilateral atherosclerotic carotid stenosis is not clear. This study assessed the frequency of a fetal origin of the PCA in patients with a TIA or infarct in the territory of the PCA with 16-multidetector-row CT angiography (CTA). METHODS: 82 patients (52 male; mean age = 64; range 19 to 90 years) with isolated homonymous hemianopia and/or a PCA infarct underwent CTA of the carotid artery and circle of Willis. RESULTS: A fetal origin of the PCA at the symptomatic side was present in 14 patients (17 %) and at the asymptomatic side in 18 patients (22%) (OR: 0.7; 95 % CI: 0.3 to 1.7). Severity of stenosis (NASCET criteria) of the ICA at the symptomatic side was &lt; 30%, 30-49% and &gt; or = 50% in 72, 2 and 8 patients, respectively. Number and frequency of a fetal origin in these groups were 12 (17 %), 0 (0%) and 2 (25 %), respectively. There was no association between a severe carotid stenosis and a fetal origin of the PCA at the symptomatic side. CONCLUSION: This study does not provide arguments for an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the territory of the PCA in patients with a fetal origin of the PCA. A few patients with a TIA or infarct in the territory of the PCA have a fetal origin of the PCA in combination with a high-grade stenosis of the ipsilateral ICA, but not more often than one would expect from chance. Nevertheless, these patients may benefit from carotid endarterectomy.",M2
18262620,"Oculomotor palsy treated by microvascular decompression.BACKGROUND: Oculomotor palsy is well known to be due to diabetes mellitus, or aneurysmal compression, or cavernous sinus lesion. Only few reports presented that arterial compression was the reason for oculomotor palsy. CASE DESCRIPTION: We performed a surgical treatment for a 76-year-old man with left oculomotor palsy. During surgical clipping of the left IC-PC aneurysm, it became clear that the left IC-PC aneurysm had not been compressing the third cranial nerve. The left oculomotor nerve was being pinched between the arteriosclerotic <e>PCA</e> and the SCA. Microvascular decompression was carried out, and the oculomotor nerve palsy improved.

17905073,"Variations and anomalies of the posterior communicating artery in Northwest Indian brains.BACKGROUND: The PCoA is a major branch of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. Thorough knowledge of the anatomy and awareness of the variations and anomalies are of clinical importance. METHODS: The PCoA was studied in 200 male and 80 female adults and in 20 male and 25 female children. These were medicolegal cases that died of an accident or poisoning after staying in a hospital for a few days. In addition to autopsy specimens, PCoA was also examined in 45 fetuses obtained from the department of obstetrics and gynecology of this institute. RESULTS: In fetal brains, at 61 to 70 mm CR stage, the average diameter of PCoA was more than that of the proximal part of the <e>PCA</e>; at 91 to 100 mm CR stage, the diameters of both vessels were equal and remained so until 130 mm CR stage; thereafter, the diameter of the proximal part of PCA became larger than PCoA. Incidence of tortuosity was more on the left than on the right side in children, and the reverse was the case in adults. Tortuosity was not found in fetal brains. The incidence of hypoplasticity and absence of PCoA in children and adults in both sexes were noted. The embryonic type (where the diameter of PCoA is more than the diameter of proximal part of PCA) was observed in 3 children and 20 adults. The incidence of aneurysms involving PCoA was 0.92% in adults. They were not seen in fetuses, newborns, and children. CONCLUSIONS: Because of hemodynamic factors in fetuses of more than 130 mm CR stage, the diameter of PCA becomes larger than that of the PCoA. An aneurysm was seen in only 1 male adult (0.5%), other anomalies present were absence, hypoplasticity, and duplication of PCoA. Present observations were different from the findings of 2 groups of the Indian workers (J Neurosurg 1984;60:572-576; J Anat Soc India 1970;19:71-79).

17878726,"Mechanism of infarction involving ipsilateral carotid and posterior cerebral artery territories.BACKGROUND: We investigated the potential mechanism of infarction involving the territories of both the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>). METHODS: Among consecutive patients with an ischemic stroke who had undergone both diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and cerebral angiography, those who were found to have acute lesions in the ipsilateral ICA and PCA territories on DWI were selected for this study. The mechanism of infarction was sought by investigating angiographic findings and DWI lesion patterns. The frequency of patency between the ICA and PCA in the patient group was compared with that in the normal control group. RESULTS: Infarctions involving ipsilateral ICA and PCA territories were rare (21 of 1,388 patients, 1.5%). Sixteen of those 21 patients (76%) demonstrated steno-occlusive lesions of the relevant ICA. Cardioembolic sources were rarely found. All but 1 patient with fetal-type PCA (fPCA) or the posterior communicating artery demonstrated significant ICA stenosis. The fPCA was more frequently found in the ipsilateral hemisphere of patients with an infarction than in the control group (44.4 vs. 18.5%, p = 0.006). Ischemic lesions in the ICA territory were usually small but multiple, and those in the PCA territory were single and located in the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Large artery atherosclerosis of the carotid artery was very common in patients with infarctions involving the ipsilateral ICA and PCA territories. Extracranial cervical artery evaluation is indispensable in those patients.",M2

An 86-year-old man with atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital with consciousness disturbance and left hemiparesis. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed high intensity lesions in the territories of the PCA and the anterior choroidal artery, leading us to make a diagnosis of cardioembolic stroke. Magnetic resonance angiography disclosed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and the right PCA. The P1 segment of the right PCA was absent, indicating that the right PCA had branched from the right ICA. Therefore, we believed that ICA occlusion caused the infarcts in the territories of both the PCA and the anterior choroidal artery. This is a rare stroke case involving the territories of both the PCA and the anterior choroidal artery.",M2
17478743,"Digital map of posterior cerebral artery infarcts associated with posterior cerebral artery trunk and branch occlusion.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Knowledge of the extent and distribution of infarcts of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) may give insight into the limits of the arterial territory and infarct mechanism. We describe the creation of a digital atlas of PCA infarcts associated with PCA branch and trunk occlusion by magnetic resonance imaging techniques. METHODS: Infarcts were manually segmented on T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained &gt;24 hours after stroke onset. The images were linearly registered into a common stereotaxic coordinate space. The segmented images were averaged to yield the probability of involvement by infarction at each voxel. Comparisons were made with existing maps of the PCA territory. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a median age of 61 years (range, 22 to 86 years) were studied. In the digital atlas of the PCA, the highest frequency of infarction was within the medial temporal lobe and lingual gyrus (probability=0.60 to 0.70). The mean and maximal PCA infarct volumes were 55.1 and 128.9 cm(3), respectively. Comparison with published maps showed greater agreement in the anterior and medial boundaries of the PCA territory compared with its posterior and lateral boundaries. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a probabilistic digital atlas of the PCA based on subacute magnetic resonance scans. This approach is useful for establishing the spatial distribution of strokes in a given cerebral arterial territory and determining the regions within the arterial territory that are at greatest risk of infarction.",M2

She had been well until 6 days after delivery when she suffered sudden onset of headache, vomiting, and unconsciousness. CT scan demonstrated SAH and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a fusiform dilatation of the left PCA (P3/P4 segment). The initial diagnosis was ruptured dissecting aneurysm, and conservative management was recommended in the acute period. DSA showed smoothening of the vascular wall 6 days after onset, and obliteration of the left P3/P4 segment was observed 13 days after onset. She was discharged without neurological deficits 26 days after onset. Postpartum SAH due to dissecting aneurysm of the PCA is rare, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postpartum headache.",M2

Brain development was evaluated on clinical examination. No difference in velocities was noted on prestimulation recordings from birth to 12 months. During light stimulation before six months, the CBFV was reduced (-11 +/- 6% in MCA and -13 +/- 5% in PCA compared with baseline values). After stimulation, the CBFV was increased (+6.7 +/- 3% in MCA and + 10.5 +/- 4% in PCA compared with baseline values). This study is in favor of cortex maturation in normal premature neonates at only six months. Consequently, functional transcranial Doppler technique will be helpful for the diagnosis of abnormal maturation timing in neonates with possible developmental retardation.",M2

In 51 healthy, right-handed volunteers MBFV were measured in PCA with opened and closed eyes and while watching colored light (red, yellow, green, blue) for 1 minute. Volunteers had eyes closed 2 minutes between different colors. MBFV in left PCA was 41.2 +/- 8.6 cm/s (mean +/- 2SD) and 27.8 +/- 8.5 cm/s with eyes opened and closed, respectively. For red light MBFV in left PCA was 31.4 +/- 7.1 cm/s, for yellow 31.4 +/- 7.2 cm/s, for green 32.0 +/- 8.3 cm/s, and for blue 33.0 +/- 7.6 cm/s.

METHODS: The clinical data of 21 patients with PCA aneurysm, 12 males and 9 females, aged 3 - 60, totally 22 aneurysms, 3 located in the P1 segment, 16 (in 15 patients) on the P2 segment, and 3 being serpentine aneurysms and involving P2-3 segment, were analyzed. One patients gave up treatment, 6 patients, with 7 aneurysms, underwent aneurysm sac occlusion, and 14 patients underwent parent vessel occlusion. RESULTS: Complete aneurysm sac occlusion was achieved in 5 patients with 6 aneurysms, and incomplete occlusion was achieved in 1 patient who died of bleeding of aneurysm the next day after the operation.

17045868,"Bilateral vertebral artery disease: transcranial Doppler assessment of the hemodynamic vulnerability to changes in posture.Posture changes may cause hemodynamic ischemic events, particularly in severe vertebrobasilar artery disease.

This study proves the feasibility to combine PT and TCD monitoring of the PCA in patients with BVAD.

METHODS: Since the left vertebral artery was compressed due to a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle and the right vertebral artery was hypoplastic, we used a carotid artery approach via a persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) to selectively catheterize the aneurysm. RESULTS: The aneurysm was occluded completely. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first case of a wide-necked PCA aneurysm treated via a PPTA and using the remodeling technique.

16788293,"The fetal variant of the circle of Willis and its influence on the cerebral collateral circulation.In a fetal-type posterior circle of Willis (FTP) there is an embryonic derivation of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) from the internal carotid artery (ICA). Besides the fact that a larger area is thus dependent on the ICA, leptomeningeal vessels cannot develop between the anterior and posterior circulation. The tentorium namely prevents cerebellar vessels from connecting to the PCA territory. Therefore patients with an FTP could be more prone to develop vascular insufficiency. An overview of the literature is given. We propose to define a partial FTP, in which a small P1 segment between the basilar artery and the postcommunicating part of the PCA is present, and a full FTP, in which the P1 segment is absent. Whether a full FTP is a risk factor for stroke should be subject of further investigation.",M2

To establish which areas were critically associated with neglect, the lesions of patients with and without neglect were compared. RESULTS: Neglect of varying severity was documented in 8 patients. In addition, higher-order visual perception was impaired in 5 of the 6 patients. Neglect was critically associated with damage to an area of white matter in the occipital lobe corresponding to a white matter tract connecting the parahippocampal gyrus with the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe. Lesions of the thalamus or splenium of the corpus callosum did not appear necessary or sufficient to cause neglect, but may mediate its severity in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: PCA stroke can result in visual neglect. Interruption of the white matter fibres connecting the parahippocampal gyrus to the angular gyrus may be important in determining whether a patient will manifest neglect.",M2
16720190,"Treatment of ruptured fusiform aneurysm in the posterior cerebral artery with posterior cerebral artery-superior cerebellar artery anastomosis combined with parent artery occlusion: case report.BACKGROUND: Surgical management of a fusiform aneurysm in the <e>PCA</e> sometimes requires occlusion of the parent artery. In such cases, reconstruction of the PCA may prevent the development of postoperative visual field defects. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman with a fusiform aneurysm in the P2 of the left PCA presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The left superficial temporal artery and OA were hypoplastic. Left temporal craniotomy revealed that the lateromesencephalic ambient segment of the SCA and the posterior half portion of the P2 segment ran parallel and near each other, and that the calibers of both arteries were relatively consistent. Thus, the 2 arteries were anastomosed in a side-to-side fashion, and the anterior half of the left P2 segment was occluded by clipping proximal and distal to the aneurysm that was located at the left P2 segment just distal to the junction to the posterior communicating artery. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated resolution of the aneurysm, with perfusion of the left PCA from the left SCA via the anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior cerebral artery-superior cerebellar artery anastomosis is a useful method of achieving PCA reconstruction in the context of a PCA aneurysm requiring occlusion of the parent vessel and when superficial temporal artery or OA-PCA anastomosis cannot be performed.",M2
16698704,"A modified technique for bypass of the external carotid artery to the proximal posterior cerebral artery: an anatomical and technical study.CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the proposition that bypass between the external carotid artery (ECA) and proximal posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) can be achieved by using a short saphenous venous graft. The diameters of the ECA and vein graft may provide an increased blood flow with a straighter course. This technique may be helpful for management of patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency or those requiring a high volume blood flow to the posterior circulation. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe a modified technique using a short saphenous vein graft for bypass between the ECA and the PCA in order to use a small length of graft material and increase the patency of the anastomosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten sides of five cadavers were dissected bilaterally. After a frontotemporal craniotomy and zygomatic arch osteotomy, the middle cranial fossa was exposed. A hole located approximately 2-3 cm posterolateral to the foramen rotunda was created extradurally. The sylvian fissure and the interpeduncular and ambient cisterns were opened. The proximal P2 segment of the PCA was identified. The ECA was found through a cervical incision. A short interposition saphenous vein graft was conducted to pass just behind the ramus mandible to the infratemporal fossa. The bypass between the ECA and P2 segment of the PCA was performed by using a short saphenous vein graft. The diameters of the ECA, P2 segment of PCA and both ends of the saphenous vein graft and its length were measured using an electronic micrometer. RESULTS: The mean cross-clamping time of the PCA was 10.4+/-1.8 min. The mean diameters of the P2 segment of the PCA and ECA were 2.2+/-0.15 mm and 3.83+/-0.28 mm, respectively. The mean length of the saphenous vein graft was 88.8+/-3.8 mm.",M2
16698168,"Estrogen and phytoestrogens: Effect on eNOS expression and in vitro vasodilation in cerebral arteries in ovariectomized Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of estrogen replacement therapy or soy isoflavones supplement on endothelium-dependent relaxation in vitro and gene expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in cerebral arteries in a rabbit model of human hypercholesterolemia. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six female ovariectomized Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits were randomised to treatment with 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E(2)), SoyLife 150 or control for 16 weeks. Ring segments of basilar artery (BA) and posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) were mounted in myographs for isometric tension recordings. Concentration response curves to carbamylcholine chloride, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and l-NAME were evaluated after precontraction with potassium. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and eNOS quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol was significantly higher at termination in the SoyLife group (P&lt;0.0001), whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was comparable in all treatment groups. Neither treatment influenced the endothelium-dependent responses to carbamylcholine chloride or l-NAME or the endothelium-independent response to SNP in any of the arteries. Correspondingly, eNOS mRNA was similarly expressed in all treatment groups in both arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of cerebral endothelial function by estrogen or soy isoflavones in ovariectomized WHHL rabbits is not supported by the present data. The findings may be unique to the WHHL rabbit in which the hypocholesterolemic effect of estrogens mediated by upregulation of liver LDL receptors is excluded.",M2
16529024,"[A case of ruptured internal carotid artery  kissing aneurysms : case report and review of the literature]OBJECTIVE: A rare case of ruptured kissing aneurysms on the right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (ICPCA) and -anterior choroidal artery (ICAchA) is reported. CASE: A 47-year-old female was transferred to our hospital because of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Cerebral angiography revealed two aneurysms on the right ICPCA and ICAchA. Right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed to obliterate them on the day of admission. Despite the presence of angiographical cleavage, these two aneurysms were attached to each other tightly, and it was extremely difficult to dissect the space between them and premature rupture occurred. A Sugita long straight clip was inserted parallel to internal carotid artery to obliterate the body of ICAchA aneurysm and the neck of ICPCA aneurysm. Another straight clip was applied to the neck of the former aneurysm. Both <e>PCA</e> and AchA could be secured successfully. Postoperatively, although she developed symptomatic vasospasm on the 10th day, she discharged without any neurological deficits 40 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the difficulty in dissection of aneurysms, the operation for kissing aneurysms has been recognized as hazardous and challenging since Jefferson. We emphasize that a clipping technique described above should be kept in mind as a safe value, though meticulous dissection of each aneurysmal neck followed by independent neck clipping is reasonable.",M2
16485822,"[Direct intervention into giant partially thrombotic fusiform aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery]The paper considers surgical treatment of patients with partially thrombotic giant and fusiform aneurysms of the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>), which is a challenge of cerebrovascular neurosurgery. Giant, fusiform aneurysms are clinically manifested themselves as a mass effect in 80% of cases and as spontaneous subarachnoidal hemorrhage in 20%. Due to their vicinity of the brain stem, giant aneurysms of PCA in any clinical course present a real threat to a patient's life. A case of clipping of partially thrombotic giant aneurysm of PCA by means of tunnel clips to form the wall of a vessel from an apron cut from the aneurysmal wall is considered in detail. Surgical treatment of partially thrombotic giant and fusiform aneurysms is identified as an individual problem of cerebrovascular neurosurgery, which awaits a sophisticated study in order to define an adequate surgical treatment.",M2
16484417,"Cerebral hemodynamics in Moyamoya disease: correlation between perfusion-weighted MR imaging and cerebral angiography.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In Moyamoya disease, the relationship between cerebral hemodynamics and angiographic findings has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate hemodynamics in Moyamoya disease with perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI) and cerebral angiography. METHODS: Twenty patients with Moyamoya disease were the subjects. Mean transit time (MTT) derived from PWI was calculated in the medial frontal lobes, the posterior frontal lobes, the occipital lobes, and the basal ganglia. From the angiographies, we classified the degrees of internal carotid artery (ICA) and posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) stenoses as well as the degrees of Moyamoya vessels and leptomeningeal anastomosis (LMA). MTT in each region was compared with the angiographic findings. RESULTS: MTT positively correlated with the degree of ICA stenosis in the medial frontal (P &lt; .01), posterior frontal (P &lt; .001), and occipital (P &lt; .001) lobes, as well as in the basal ganglia (P &lt; .001). MTT correlated with the degree of PCA stenosis in the medial frontal (P &lt; .001), posterior frontal (P &lt; .001), and occipital (P &lt; .001) lobes, as well as in the basal ganglia (P &lt; .001). MTT correlated with the degree of Moyamoya vessels in the medial frontal (P &lt; .05) and posterior frontal (P &lt; .01) lobes. A multivariate analysis revealed that ICA and PCA stenoses and Moyamoya vessels were independent factors that prolonged MTT. CONCLUSION: Both ICA and PCA stenoses may influence overall cerebral perfusion in Moyamoya disease. The development of Moyamoya vessels may indicate hemodynamic impairment.",M2
16423540,"Selective posterior cerebral artery amobarbital test in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy for surgical treatment.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the selective posterior cerebral artery amobarbital test (PCAAT) can predict postoperative memory function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) for surgical treatment and its clinical safety. METHODS: The database included adult patients with intractable TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 1995 and 2002. The PCAAT was carried out on patients who had failed conventional intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) or had IAT results that evoked a concern of postoperative memory function decline. A battery of learning and memory testing was performed immediately before and after injection of amobarbital into the peduncular segment of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) on the presumed hemisphere of epileptogenicity. Neuropsychological assessments were followed in surgically treated patients. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients completed PCAAT successfully and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Four patients failed PCAAT angiographic procedures due to technical difficulty in one patient, transient signs of vasospasm in two patients, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in one patient. Of the 12 patients who performed well in PCAAT learning and memory testing items by free recall or recognition, only 1 patient demonstrated postoperative memory decline in follow-up neuropsychological assessments. In contrast, two of the four patients with a deficit in PCAAT memory testing showed postoperative memory decline. Regarding subjective memory function (not necessarily associated with objective memory decline), patients not seizure-free after ATL were more likely to have memory complaints (in 3 out of 6 patients) than patients with seizure-free outcomes (in 1 out of 10 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The PCAAT memory test reliably predicts postoperative memory function in patients with TLE for surgical treatment. However, the inherent risks of PCAAT must be considered and it should be used judiciously.",M2
16401846,"Deafferentation-disconnection neglect induced by posterior cerebral artery infarction.OBJECTIVE: To investigate patients with posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) infarctions to learn whether hemispatial neglect is more frequent and severe after right than left PCA infarction; whether visual field defects (VFDs) influence the presence or severity of hemispatial neglect; and the anatomic loci of lesions that are associated with hemispatial neglect. METHODS: The authors recruited 45 patients with PCA infarction that involved only the occipital lobe or the occipital lobe plus other areas served by the PCA. All subjects received seven neglect tests within 2 months after onset. RESULTS: Overall, the frequency of hemispatial neglect was 42.2%. The frequency did not significantly differ between the right (48.0%) and left (35.0%) PCA groups, but the severity of hemispatial neglect was significantly greater in the right group. VFD alone did not influence the frequency or severity of neglect after controlling other variables. Isolated occipital lesions were rarely associated with hemispatial neglect, and it was only the occipital plus splenial lesion that significantly influenced the frequency and severity of neglect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that after excluding such confounding factors as aphasia or hemiplegia, neglect frequency does not differ between the right and left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) groups, but the severity of neglect is greater after right PCA infarctions; even in the acute stage of PCA infarction; visual field defect from an isolated occipital lesion does not cause hemispatial neglect; and the injury to both the occipital lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum is important for producing hemispatial neglect with PCA infarction.",M2
16397187,"The hyperdense posterior cerebral artery sign: a computed tomography marker of acute ischemia in the posterior cerebral artery territory.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In the anterior circulation, the hyperdense middle cerebral artery (MCA) sign is a well-established marker for early ischemia. Similarly, the hyperdense basilar artery sign or the MCA  dot  sign may be a diagnostic clue for basilar artery or distal MCA branch thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to define the hyperdense posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) sign and determine its incidence, diagnostic value, and reliability as a marker for ischemia in the territory of the PCA. METHODS: Cranial computed tomographies (CCTs) of 48 patients with proven acute ischemia (&lt;12 hours) in the PCA territory were compared by 3 independent and blinded readers to the CCTs of 86 age-matched patients without PCA infarction. Using follow-up imaging, the correlation of the hyperdense PCA (HPCA) with infarct size, thalamic infarction, and bleeding were investigated. RESULTS: An HPCA was found in 35.4% of all patients with PCA infarction, typically within the ambient cistern, with a specificity of 95.4%. The thalamus was affected significantly more often (P=0.009) and the size of the infarct was significantly more often large than medium (P=0.018) or small (P&lt;0.001) when an HPCA was present. Hemorrhagic transformation tended to occur more often when the HPCA was present. CONCLUSIONS: An HPCA was detected in more than one third of all patients with PCA ischemia, suiting the incidence of the hyperdense MCA. Based on our results, this sign may not only be helpful in the early diagnosis of PCA infarction but might also act as a prognostic marker in acute PCA territory ischemic stroke.",M2
16218913,"Impact of vertebral artery disease on dynamic cerebral autoregulation.OBJECTIVES: This study applied dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) testing distally to severe bilateral vertebral artery disease (BVAD). METHODS: Using continuous monitoring of beat-to-beat blood pressure and transcranial Doppler of the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>) were examined in 20 patients with BVAD and 22 controls. DCA testing was based on the 'high-pass filter model', which predicts a positive phase relationship between spontaneous oscillations (M-waves 3-9 cpm and R-waves 9-20 cpm) in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. RESULTS: In patients with BVAD, DCA testing detected autoregulatory deficits of different degrees. The lowest M-wave phase shift angles were found in the PCA territory distally to intracranial BVAD. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DCA testing of the PCA could help to quantify the hemodynamic impact of BVAD. It highlights the relevance of functional TCD sonography as a useful diagnostic tool for the hemodynamic evaluation of vertebrobasilar disease.",M2
16184300,"Mean blood flow velocities in posterior cerebral arteries during visual stimulation.Changes of mean blood flow velocities (MBFV) in the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>) recorded during visual stimulation in a group of 51 healthy, right-handed volunteers are presented. There were 27 (52.9%) males and 24 (47.1%) females, aged 20-59 years (mean age: 36.98 years). Measurements were performed with a hand-held 2 MHz transcranial Doppler (TCD) probe through the temporal window, with the subjects' eyes open and closed, and while they were looking at constant and at flashing white light. In half of the subjects, first the right PCA was insonated and then the left PCA, while in the other half the reverse procedure was used. Statistical analysis was done using Wilcoxon's matched-pair signed-rank test. Mean MBFV value in the left PCA was 41.2+/-8.6 cm/s (mean +/- SD) with eyes open, 27.8+/-8.5 cm/s with eyes closed, 42.3+/-9.1 cm/s while looking at constant white light, and 43.0+/-9.6 cm/s while looking at flashing white light. Mean MBFV value in the right PCA was 41.7+/-8.9 cm/s with eyes open, 28.2+/-9.1 cm/s with eyes closed, 42.4+/-8.8 cm/s while looking at constant white light, and 43.4+/-9.2 while looking at flashing white light. Value differences for the left PCA, between eyes open and closed and between looking at constant white light and looking at flashing white light were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, z= -6.2146, and p&lt;0.001, z= -3.4836, respectively). For the right PCA, a value difference between eyes open and closed, and between looking at constant and flashing white light was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, z= -6.2146 and p&lt;0.001, z= -3.6928), but there was no significant difference between eyes open and constant white light (p=0.03, z= -2.1693). The results showed that simple visual stimulation had an effect on blood flow velocities in PCA and that it could be measured with TCD.",M2

15690444,"Hemodynamics of the posterior cerebral arteries in neonates with periventricular leukomalacia.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cerebral blood flow of the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCAs</e>) in neonates in relation to the onset of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). METHODS: Among 57 low-birth-weight neonates studied, 7 were diagnosed with PVL with cyst formation on sonography and MRI. The mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured in all the neonates by Doppler sonography through the posterior fontanel separately in the right and left PCA at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 70 following birth. RESULTS: In the 7 neonates with PVL the mean CBFV in the right PCA was significantly lower than that in neonates without PVL at days 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 70; the mean CBFV in the left PCA of neonates with PVL was significantly lower than that in those without PVL at days 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, and 70. CBFV measured in neonates without PVL exhibited a gradual increase postnatally. In contrast, CBFV values for neonates with PVL plateaued after day 5 or 7. CONCLUSIONS: The serial measurement of PCA CBFV postnatally may prove useful as a predictor of the development of PVL.",M2
15658105,"Microsurgical anatomy of cerebral revascularization. Part II: posterior circulation.OBJECT: Revascularization is an important component of treatment for complex aneurysms, skull base tumors, and vertebrobasilar ischemia in the posterior circulation. In this study, the authors examined the microsurgical anatomy related to cerebral revascularization in the posterior circulation and demonstrate various procedures for bypass surgery. METHODS: The microsurgical anatomy of cerebral and cerebellar vessels as they relate to revascularization procedure and techniques, including extracranial-to-intracranial bypass grafting, arterial interposition grafting, and side-to-side anastomosis, were examined by performing stepwise dissections in 22 adult cadaveric specimens. The arteries and veins in the specimens were perfused with colored silicone. Dominant cerebral and cerebellar revascularization procedures in the posterior circulations include superficial temporal artery (STA)-posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>), STA-superior cerebellar artery (SCA), occipital artery (OA)-anterior inferior cerebellar artery, OA-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and PICA-PICA anastomoses. These procedures are effective in relatively small but critical areas including the brainstem and cerebellum. For revascularization of larger areas a saphenous vein graft is used to create a bypass between the PCA and the external carotid artery. Surgical procedures are generally difficult to perform in deep and narrow operative spaces near critical vital structures. CONCLUSIONS: Although a clear guideline for cerebral revascularization procedures has not yet been established, it is important to understand various microsurgical techniques and their related anatomical structures. This will help surgeons consider surgical indications for treatment of patients with vertebrobasilar ischemia caused by aneurysms, tumors, or atherosclerotic diseases in the posterior circulation.",M2
15622515,"Variability of the division of the cortical branches of the posterior cerebral artery.This article presents a method of analysis of variation in the cortical branching of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>). The method takes account of previous observations and reflects various symptoms of such variation. Of 100 cerebral hemispheres into whose vessels a contrast medium was injected, 94 hemispheres have been qualified for further examination. In six hemispheres, there were anomalies of the PCA, which are not included in the present analysis of division. A general model of the division of the artery has been developed. On the basis of this model, principles of the analysis of the variation have been discussed. The model comprises of three elements. The first is the main trunk. The second is intermediate trunks. The third element may appear in two forms: proper cortical arteries and cortical arterial groups. The main trunk was defined as the vessels arising from the final division of the basilar artery with its end in the place of branching of the most peripheral proper cortical artery, that is, parieto-occipital artery. Intermediate trunks are these parts of the PCA that extend between the main trunk and proper cortical arteries or cortical arterial groups. The identification criterion for the intermediate trunks is its length, which is to be equal to or exceed the sum of the radius of the two vessels, which the intermediate trunk gives off. There have been distinguished primary and secondary intermediate trunks. Proper cortical arteries or cortical arterial groups are parts of the PCA by means of which blood is supplied directly to the cortex. Cortical branches of the PCA of a relatively constant topography and vascularization were termed proper cortical arteries. In some cases, cortical branches are accompanied by small vessels of varying number and size. They were named accessory cortical arteries. Proper cortical arteries together with accompanying accessory cortical arteries have been named cortical arterial groups. The number of the proper cortical arteries is considered to be constant and is six. The theory of combinations has been applied to establish all possible branching variants. There are 16 such variants. Eleven of them (68%) were represented in the analyzed material. In seven hemispheres (7.4%), intermediate trunks were not observed. In 87 hemispheres (92.6%), there were present primary intermediate trunks. In four hemispheres (4.2%), there were found primary and secondary intermediate trunks. Both proper cortical arteries and cortical arterial groups reached the first five cortical areas of the PCA. The last cortical area was reached by a cortical arterial group only.",M2
15572198,"Peptidergic and non-peptidergic innervation and vasomotor responses of human lenticulostriate and posterior cerebral arteries.The aim of the present study was to compare in man the innervation pattern and the functional responses to neuronal messengers in medium sized lenticulostriate and branches of the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>). The majority of the nerve fibers found were sympathetic and displayed specific immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Only few nerve fibers displayed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) immunoreactivity. In both arteries, the contractions induced by noradrenaline (NA), NPY and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the relaxant responses induced by acetylcholine (ACh), VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-27 (PACAP) as well as CGRP and SP were compared in vitro. In conclusion, there was no major difference in innervation pattern or vasomotor sensitivity (pEC50 and pIC50 values) between the two vessels. However, the general pattern indicates stronger vasomotor responses (Emax and Imax) in the PCA branches as compared to the lenticulostriate arteries which may lend support for the clinical observation of a difference in stroke expression between the two vascular areas.",M2

15544897,"Multi-slice CT angiography in evaluation of extracranial-intracranial bypass.Multi-slice CT (MSCT) scanners provided significant improvement in vascular applications. In this study, our purpose was to determine the clinical utility of MSCTA in evaluation of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass patency. Eleven (4 men and 7 women; mean age, 46 years; age range, 19-68 years) consecutive patients who underwent MSCTA and DSA after EC-IC bypass surgery were evaluated retrospectively. All patients underwent DSA within 3 weeks of MSCTA. The indications for EC-IC bypass were severe stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries in seven patients and therapeutic occlusion of intracranial artery for unclippable giant aneurysm in four patients. Ten patients underwent superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass and one patient underwent occipital artery-posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) bypass. Eight STA-MCA bypasses in six patients were patent on MSCTA which were confirmed on DSA. Two STA-MCA bypasses and one occipital artery-posterior cerebral artery (PCA) bypass were occluded in three patients on MSCTA and DSA. In one patient, minimal stenosis of the STA-MCA bypass was identified on MSCTA and DSA. In 1 patient, STA-MCA bypass was not well seen on MSCTA and suspected for occlusion. DSA identified the occlusion of bypass on this patient. MSCTA seems to be a very promising noninvasive technique in evaluation of EC-IC bypass.",M2
15476460,"Emotional responses during unilateral amobarbital anesthesia: differential hemispheric contributions?OBJECTIVES: To explore (1) effects of test and subject variables in determining euphoric and dysphoric responses during unilateral amobarbital anesthesia and (2) which cerebral areas contribute to the emotional responses. METHOD: Incidence of euphoric and dysphoric reactions during left- and right-sided amobarbital anesthesia of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and selective anesthesia of the middle cerebral (MCA) and the posterior cerebral (<e>PCA</e>) artery was recorded. The sample comprised 270 Norwegians (6-61 years), and a total of 562 injections were performed under conditions endeavoring to calm down the patients. RESULTS: The overall incidence of observed emotional responses during ICA anesthesia was 21.5%, euphoric reactions being about 10 times more frequent than dysphoric. The incidence of euphoric reactions, however, was not significantly higher under right- than under left-sided anesthesia, and dysphoric reactions were not more frequent under left- than under right-sided anesthesia. Indeed, 13 patients showed elevated mood under both right- and left-sided anesthesia. Anesthesia of the territories of ICA and MCA gave rise to similar results, while no cases of mood change were observed under selective PCA anesthesia. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that unilateral amobarbital anesthesia as such, irrespective of side, may trigger both euphoric and dysphoric responses. The relative frequency obtained is influenced importantly both by the emotional responsiveness of the subjects and the emotional climate of the test situation. Finally, it is suggested that brain regions supplied by the PCA contribute less to modulation of euphoric and dysphoric responses than those supplied by the MCA or the ICA.",M2
15370572,"Radial artery graft for bypass of the maxillary to proximal posterior cerebral artery: an anatomical and technical study.OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of a radial artery graft for bypass of the maxillary artery (MA) to proximal posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) as an alternative to the external carotid artery (ECA) to PCA anastomosis used in posterior circulation bypass surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method was applied to five adult cadaver sides bilaterally. The MA was easily found 1-2 cm beneath the infratemporal crest after a frontotemporal craniotomy and a zygomatic arch osteotomy. Extradurally, 2-3 cm posterolateral to the foramen rotundum, a hole was drilled in the sphenoid bone with a 4-mm tipped drill. After sylvian fissure, the interpedincular and ambient cisternae were opened and the P2 segment of the PCA appeared. The graft was passed through the hole and dura to reach the P2 segment. Proximal to the infraorbital artery branch, the MA was freed from the surrounding tissue and transected. The proximal side of the radial artery graft was anastomosed end-to-end with the MA and the distal side was anastomosed end-to-side with the P2 segment of the PCA. RESULTS: The average diameter of the MA proximal to the infraorbital artery branch was 2.6+/-0.3 mm. The average diameter of the P2 was 2.2+/-0.2 mm. The average length of the graft was 47+/-5.2 mm. CONCLUSION: As MA to proximal PCA bypass uses a short radial graft and as the calibers of the MA and PCA are &gt;2 mm such a bypass may provide sufficient blood flow and represents a reasonable alternative to  ECA to PCA  bypass.",M2
15315525,"Cerebrovascular response to repetitive visual stimulation in interictal migraine with aura.Cortical hypersensitivity and absent habituation to different stimuli have been observed in migraine patients. These features might also be transmitted to the cerebral vasoreactivity, but results are conflicting so far. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) was used to assess cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) changes in the middle (MCA) and posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>) in relation to repetitive checkerboard visual stimulation. Stimulation consisted of 10 consecutive cycles, each comprising 10 s stimulation and 10 s rest. TCD recordings were analysed using stimulus-related averaging algorithm. Data of 19 interictal migraineurs with aura were compared to those of 19 headache-free healthy volunteers. The CBFV increase in PCA and in MCA during visual stimulation was significantly larger and steeper in migraineurs than in controls (P = 0.017 and P = 0.005). The response in PCA remained stable over the 10 stimulation cycles, both in migraineurs and in controls. The response in MCA was stable only in migraineurs. In controls it decreased over the last 5 stimulation cycles compared with the first 5 cycles (P = 0.04). Migraineurs with aura exhibit a larger cerebrovascular response to repetitive visual stimulation compared to headache-free subjects. A reduced adaptation to environmental stimuli in migraine is suggested, since there was no habituation in migraineurs in contrast to healthy controls.",M2
15230707,"Selective posterior cerebral artery amobarbital test: its role in presurgical memory assessment in temporal lobe epilepsy.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and risk of complications of selective posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) amobarbital anesthesia in memory assessment of patients with epilepsy under consideration for temporal lobe resection. METHODS: Thirty-two candidates for temporal lobectomy in whom conclusive memory assessment could not be obtained by the standard intracarotid amobarbital procedure were submitted to a selective PCA amobarbital test. A mean dose of 75 mg amobarbital was injected via microcatheter into the P2 segment of the PCA. Ten common objects were presented for naming and remembering while the anesthesia was judged efficient. After return to neurologic baseline, recall and recognition memory were assessed. RESULTS: In all of the 32 patients, angiography and PCA anesthesia were successfully accomplished without serious adverse events. All but one of the patients remained alert and cooperative for memory testing under the anesthesia, and 28 of these patients showed adequate memory capacity of the hemisphere contralateral to the side targeted for surgery. So far, 19 patients have proceeded to surgery, and no case of global amnesia or serious, material-specific memory impairment has resulted. Three patients failed the PCA test (fewer than 67% items correctly recognized) and were excluded from surgery, partly on the basis of the PCA test results, but also supported by an overall evaluation of all the diagnostic procedures used. CONCLUSIONS: The selective PCA amobarbital test appears justifiable when performed by interventional neuroradiologists and may significantly reduce the risk of erroneously excluding patients with epilepsy from temporal resection. Further corroboration of the safety of the procedure seems warranted.",M2
15218272,"Dominant ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery on magnetic resonance angiography in acute ischemic stroke.BACKGROUND: In acute infarction involving the anterior circulation, the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) often appears to be longer than the contralateral PCA on magnetic resonance angiography. We described this finding as dominant ipsilateral PCA (DIPCA). We sought to find the frequency of DIPCA and its predictors. METHODS: We recruited 164 consecutive individuals with acute infarct involving the anterior circulation, and analyzed their radiological and clinical features. RESULTS: DIPCA was noted in 27 patients (16.5%). It was more frequent in patients with than in patients without steno-occlusive disease of the ipsilateral anterior circulation (30.5 vs. 2.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between the severity of arterial lesions in the ipsilateral anterior circulation and DIPCA (p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: DIPCA may reflect increased leptomeningeal collateral flow via the ipsilateral PCA, and its development may be dependent on the stenotic anterior circulation.",M2
15185754,"Aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery: retrospective review of surgical treatment.A series of 10 cases of posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. There were five men and five women aged 38 to 68 years (mean 57.5 years). Seven patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two aneurysms were found incidentally during clinical examination for stroke. One aneurysm was associated with moyamoya disease. All aneurysms were saccular. The aneurysms arose from the P1 segment in three patients, the P1/P2 junction in three patients, the P2 segment in three patients, and the P3 segment in one patient. Two patients died before operation and one patient refused surgery. Aneurysmal clipping was performed for seven patients. All aneurysms except the P2 and the P3 aneurysms were treated via the pterional approach. Four patients had excellent outcome, but one patient with a P3 aneurysm developed homonymous hemianopsia due to thrombosis of the parent vessel and another patient with a P2 aneurysm had moderate disability from the initial insult. Coil embolization has been indicated as the first choice of therapy, but PCA aneurysms are good candidates for direct clipping.",M2
15142320,"Basilar artery to bilateral posterior cerebral artery 'Y stenting' for endovascular reconstruction of wide-necked basilar apex aneurysms: report of three cases.Endovascular reconstruction of basilar artery (BA) apex aneurysms has been augmented by adjunctive techniques such as balloon and stent assistance. We present three cases of a wide-necked BA apex aneurysm involving the bilateral P1 segments of both posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCAs</e>) treated by placement of BA to PCA stents bilaterally in a 'Y' configuration to reconstruct the BA apex for effective coil embolization. Three patients (aged 70, 65 and 37 years) with wide-necked basilar artery aneurysms presented for endovascular treatment. All aneurysms had necks that involved the bilateral P1 segments. Each patient was deemed an appropriate candidate for endovascular reconstruction. Patients were pretreated with clopidogrel (75 mg) and aspirin (325 mg) each day for 3 days prior to the procedure. Following induction of general anesthesia, access to the right femoral artery was obtained by placement of a 6F sheath. Intravenous heparin was administered to achieve an activated coagulation time (ACT) of approximately 300 seconds. A 6F guide catheter was placed within the left vertebral artery (VA) in two patients, the right VA in a third. Utilizing over-the-wire (OTW) technique, a microcatheter was advanced into the left P2-P3 junction of the PCA. A 300-cm 0.014-inch microwire was passed through the microcatheter into the distal PCA and the microcatheter was removed. In each case, two neuroform stents were prepared (SMART Therapeutics Inc., San Leandro, CA) and advanced OTW into the PCA with the most acute angle relative to the BA. The initial stent placed was 20 mm in length and was deployed from the P1 segment into the BA. The microwire was pulled retrograde into the BA apex, then advanced though the stent struts and into the right PCA. A second stent, 15 mm in length, was advanced OTW through the struts of the previously placed stent. It was then deployed from the P1 into the BA where it overlapped the first stent, resulting in a stent-in-stent 'Y' configuration at the BA apex. A microcatheter was advanced OTW into the BA apex aneurysm and coil embolization proceeded in the usual fashion. Following the procedure, each patient was maintained in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU). All remained neurologically intact. The two elderly patients were discharged to home the morning following the procedure. The third patient suffered an upper GI bleed and was treated an additional 3 days in hospital. Oral clopidogrel (75 mg by mouth) and aspirin (325 mg by mouth) were continued daily for 4 weeks. The 'Y' stent configuration for reconstruction of the BA apex is a safe effective technique in patients with wide-necked BA aneurysms.",M2
15127219,"Accuracy of CT angiography in the assessment of a fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery.An uncommon cause of cerebral ischemia in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) is the combination of a fetal origin of the PCA and atherosclerotic disease in the internal carotid artery. This study compared the accuracy of CTA with DSA in the assessment of a fetal origin of the PCA. Patients in whom an intracranial DSA and CTA had been performed were reviewed. A fetal origin was defined as a normal-sized patent posterior communicating artery (PCoA) with hypoplasia or aplasia of the ipsilateral P1 segment. One hundred PCAs in 51 patients were analyzed. A fetal origin was present in ten vessels (10%, eight patients). CTA revealed all of them. CTA considered an additional three vessels as having a fetal origin, while DSA revealed a PCoA with the same diameter as the P1 segment of the PCA. Sensitivity and specificity of CTA in the assessment of a fetal origin could be estimated at 100 and 97%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 77 and 100%, respectively. CTA can be considered a valid diagnostic tool for the assessment of a fetal origin of the PCA in patients with a cerebral ischemic event in the territory of the PCA.",M2
15061825,"Spectrum of superficial posterior cerebral artery territory infarcts.Posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) territory infarction is not uncommon. Published series were concentrated either on isolated deep PCA territory infarcts or on incomplete calcarine artery territory infarcts. Although, correlations between clinical symptoms, causes of stroke and outcome at 6-months in patients with superficial PCA territory stroke are less well known. We sought prospectively stroke causes, infarct topography, and clinical findings of 137 patients with superficial PCA territory infarcts with or without mesencephalic/thalamic involvement, representing 11% of patients with posterior circulation ischemic stroke in our Stroke Registry. We analyzed patients by subdividing into three subgroups; (1). cortical infarct (CI) group; (2). cortical and deep infarcts (CDI) (thalamic and/or mesencephalic involvement) group; (3). bilateral infarcts (BI) group. We studied the outcomes of patients at 6-month regarding clinical findings, risk factors and vascular mechanisms by means of comprehensive vascular and cardiac studies. Seventy-one patients (52%) had cortical (CI) PCA infarct, 52 patients (38%) had CDI, and 14 patients (10%) had bilateral PCA infarct (BI). In the CDI group, unilateral thalamus was involved in 38 patients (73%) and unilateral mesencephalic involvement was present in 27% of patients. The presumed causes of infarction were intrinsic PCA disease in 33 patients (26%), proximal large-artery disease (PLAD) in 33 (24%), cardioembolism in 23 (17%), co-existence of PLAD and cardioembolism in 7 (5%), vertebral or basilar artery dissection in 8 (6%), and coagulopathy in 2. The death rate was 7% in our series and stroke recurrence was 16% during 6-month follow-up period. Features of the stroke that was associated with significant increased risk of poor outcome included, consciousness disturbances at stroke onset (RR, 66.6; 95% CI, 8.6-515.5), mesencephalic and/or thalamic involvement (RR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.49-9.65), PLAD (RR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.09-6.73), and basilar artery disease (RR, 5.94; 95% CI, 1.73-20.47). The infarct mechanisms in three different types of superficial PCA territory stroke were quite similar, but cardioembolism was found more frequent in those with cortical PCA territory infarction. Although, the cause of stroke could not reliably dictate the infarct topography and clinical features. Visual field defect was the main clinical symptom in all groups, but sensorial, motor and neuropsychological deficits occurred mostly in those with CDI. Outcome is good in general, although patients having PLAD and basilar artery disease had more risk of stroke recurrence and poor outcome rather than those with intrinsic PCA disease.",M2
14988573,"Dynamic autoregulation testing in the posterior cerebral artery.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic autoregulation has been studied predominantly in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Because certain clinical conditions, ie, presyncopal symptoms or hypertensive encephalopathy, suggest a higher vulnerability of autoregulation within posterior parts of the brain, we investigated whether the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) is modulated differently within the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>). METHODS: Spontaneous oscillations of CBFV and arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the frequency range of 0.5 to 20 cycles per minute were studied in 30 volunteers (supine and tilted positions). Analysis was based on the  high-pass filter model,  which predicts a specific frequency-dependent phase and amplitude relationship between oscillations in CBFV to ABP. These parameters, characterized as phase shift angles and transfer function gains, were calculated from simultaneously recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure and transcranial Doppler signals of the PCA and MCA by means of cross-spectrum analysis. RESULTS: In the MCA and PCA, phase shift angles were decreased, and gains were elevated with increasing oscillation frequency. The PCA gain values in supine and tilted positions were significantly higher than in the MCA. CONCLUSIONS: The phase and amplitude relationship between CBFV and ABP showed a frequency dependence in the PCA similar to that in the MCA. The study therefore suggests that the high-pass filter model of dynamic cerebral autoregulation can be applied to the PCA. In this model the generally higher gain values in the PCA indicate a lower damping of ABP oscillations, which are transmitted to the posterior part of cerebral circulation.",M2
14981571,"Visually evoked changes of blood flow velocity and pulsatility index in the posterior cerebral arteries: a transcranial Doppler study.OBJECTIVE: Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) can detect visual evoked blood flow responses non-invasively and continuously with high temporal resolution. While the mean flow velocity response to visual stimuli is well documented, the response of the pulsatile characteristics of the waveform is less well known. METHOD: We examined the changes of blood flow velocity and pulsatility index (PI) in the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) in 50 healthy volunteers. TCD responses were measured in response to metabolic activation of the visual cortex by visual stimulation. RESULTS: A specific, stimulus-related increase of the mean flow velocity (MFV) in the PCA was found. The intensity of the blood flow response was significantly influenced by the complexity of the stimulus. During complex visual stimulation we found a mean flow velocity (MFV) increase of 29.4 % from the baseline in the subjects. However, a stimulus-related decrease was observed in the pulsatility index (PI); although the mean PI with closed eyes during baseline measurement was 1.18 (SD 0.27), on average, it fell significantly to 0.95 (SD 0.23) with the alternating chessboard and 0.82 (SD 0.22) during the complex stimulus condition. The relative decrement of the pulsatility index with increasing complexity of the visual stimulus is highly significant, with values of -19.5 % and -30.5 % compared to the baseline. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the inverse correlation between MFV response and pulsatility index in the PCA. We assume that this decrease of the PI in the PCA may reflect the reduced regional vascular resistance in the visual cortex during visual stimulation.",M2
14729535,"Prominent laterality of the posterior cerebral artery at three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography in M1-segment middle cerebral artery occlusion.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiography (3D TOF MRA) often discloses prominent posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) laterality in the setting of M1-segment middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We sought to analyze the implications of prominent PCA laterality at 3D TOF MRA. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3D TOF MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings in 25 patients (12 male, 13 female; mean age, 68.8 years [age range, 29-94 years]) with M1-segment occlusion. The observable laterality of the PCA, determined on the basis of 3D TOF MRA findings, was scored according to distal signal extent and compared with findings of collateral flow from the ipsilateral PCA via the leptomeningeal anastomosis (LMA) at DSA. Frequency of PCA laterality at 3D TOF MRA in patients and that in 56 healthy control subjects was also compared. RESULTS: The positive predictive value of PCA laterality for the existence of collateral flow was 99.9% and the negative predictive value 30.7%. The distal extent of ipsilateral PCA signal at 3D TOF MRA positively correlated with the grade of collateral flow from the PCA via the LMA (r = 0.802; P &lt;.01). PCA laterality was significantly less common in control subjects (P &lt;.01). CONCLUSION: Prominent PCA laterality at 3D TOF MRA in patients with M1-segment occlusion represents the existence of collateral flow from the PCA via the LMA.",M2
12833877,"[Isolated posterior cerebral artery dissection--case report and review of the literature]Although dissecting aneurysms appear not to be as rare as previously reported, their etiology remains unclear. We describe a rare case of a girl with ischemia in the region of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>). The patient complained of a mild headache and left upper paresthesia. Neurological findings revealed a mild left hemiparesis. Visual field was intact, and cardiac embolism was excluded due to the almost normal chest X-p, ECG, and UCG. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. However, MRA and angiography revealed a linear shadow and an irregular caliber change at the right P1-P2 segment. Conservative therapy was pursued and the patient showed full neurological recovery. After a 3-month follow-up period, MRI showed no recurrence and MRA showed that the lesion had returned to normal. Here, we report the case as well as review the literature relating to this disorder, including discussion of its etiology, clinical features, radiological findings, and management strategies. We conclude that this disorder should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in young people.",M2

12659239,"TCD study of hemodynamic changes in <e>PCA</e> response to photic stimulation.OBJECTIVES: During visual stimulation, the elevated metabolism rate will couple with increase of blood flow velocity(BFV) in posterior cerebral artery(PCA). This study with TCD was aimed to investigate whether the coupling might change according to the different vasoneuronal conditions. METHODS: Ninety-nine volunteers including 24 hypertension(HT) patients and 2 patients suffering from both HT and diabetes mellitus (DM) were enrolled in this trial. BFV and pulse indexes(PI) in P2 segments of PCA on both sides were monitored during visual stimulation. RESULTS: In all subjects, Mean BFV increased and PI went down in response to visual stimulation. The percentages of changes (deltaV and deltaP) of both mean BFV and PI were larger in young group( &lt; 55 years old) than in old one(&gt; or = 55 years old). There was significant positive correlation between deltaV and deltaP. Multivariated regression analysis did not show HT and DM, but age related to deltaV(deltaP). We did not find significant difference of deltaV(deltaP) between left and right sides. CONCLUSIONS: Blood flow velocity in PCA P2 segment increased due to decreased cerebrovascular resistance during visual stimulation and the response weakened with aging of the patient.",M2

The examined group consisted of 17 patients, mean age 57 +/- 12 yr, with posterior circulation infarct. Neurological examination, brain CT and Doppler examination including evaluation of BFV and CVR of MCA, <e>PCA</e> and VA was performed in each patient. Doppler examination was done using Pioneer TC 2020 and capnograph Tidal Wave sp Novametrix. RESULTS: BFV of ICA's, MCA's, ACA's and PCA's were diminished while BFV of VA's were significantly diminished in the examined patients compared to healthy controls. CVR of MCA in posterior circulation stroke patients was significantly lower compared to controls. CVR of PCA and VA was significantly lower compared to CVR of MCA in patients with posterior circulation stroke. CONCLUSION: Impairment of CVR, especially in posterior circulation, plays an important role in posterior circulation stroke pathogenesis.",M2
12491581,"[Clinical significance of posterior cerebral artery stenosis/occlusion in moyamoya disease]PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at clarifying the clinical significance of posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) stenosis/occlusion in pediatric and adult moyamoya disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 132 patients (52 children and 80 adults) who were diagnosed as by cerebral angiography having moyamoya disease. CT or MRI was performed to examine the location of cerebral infarction in all subjects. Cerebral blood flow and vasoreactivity to acetazolamide were measured in 80 patients before surgery, using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Three-dimensional MR angiography (3D-MRA) was repeated in 32 pediatric patients after surgery in order to clarify the natural course of the PCA stenosis/occlusion. RESULTS: Of 264 sides in 132 patients, PCA stenosis/occlusion was observed in 50 sides of 40 patients (30.3%). Its incidence was significantly higher in ischemic-type patients than in hemorrhagic-type and asymptomatic patients, and was higher in patients in the advanced stage of the disease. The hemisphere ipsilateral to PCA stenosis/occlusion had higher incidence of ischemic symptoms, cerebral infarction, and impaired cerebral hemodynamics. TIA (hemianopsia) or cerebral infarction in the occipital lobe was noted in 4 (10%) of 40 patients during follow-up periods after bypass surgery for anterior circulation. Of 32 pediatric patients, none showed progression of PCA stenosis on 3D-MRA during follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the involvement of PCA could increase the risk of TIA and/or cerebral infarction in both anterior and posterior circulation areas, suggesting that the PCA plays an important collateral role in moyamoya disease.",M2

Although the aneurysm was asymptomatic, treatment of the aneurysm was indicated to avoid possible hemorrhage and/or mass effect. Since the patient tolerated temporary balloon occlusion of the right PCA at P1-P2 segments and sufficient collateral flow to the right temporo-occipital region was observed during such occlusion, parent artery occlusion as well as intraluminal occlusion of the aneurysm was performed with Guglielmi detachable coils. The patient did not develop neurological deficit immediately after embolization. However, he subsequently developed Dejerine-Roussy syndrome due to an infarction in the territory of the thalamogeniculate artery. Parent artery occlusion together with intraluminal aneurysmal obliteration is an useful treatment for a fusiform aneurysm of the PCA. However, ischemic complication in the territory of the perforating artery can not be predicted.",M2

Brain MRI did not reveal any lesions, while angiography demonstrated focal stenoses in the proximal portion of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>).

12185549,"Endovascular parent artery occlusion in large-giant or fusiform distal posterior cerebral artery aneurysms.Posterior cerebral artery aneurysms are amenable to deconstructive surgical treatment because of the rich collateral supply of the distal posterior cerebral artery. This report retrospectively analyses the outcome of endovascular parent artery occlusion for large or fusiform distal posterior cerebral artery aneurysms. Medical records and cerebral angiograms from two endovascular centres were analysed retrospectively. Eight patients with large or fusiform distal posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) aneurysms were treated by endovascular occlusion of the segment of the PCA at the site of the aneurysm. Three of those were treated urgently after acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, the remainder had elective treatment. The clinical and angiographic outcomes in seven patients were assessed at 6 to 12 months. A single case of occipital infarction resulting in permanent homonymous hemianopia was the only permanent complication. Of the remaining patients, six made excellent recoveries and one was lost to follow-up. No recurrence or re-bleeding was noted. Endovascular parent artery occlusion may be an alternative to surgical parent artery occlusion in distal PCA aneurysms which are not convenient for selective endovascular treatment or surgical clipping.",M2
12140669,"Pure superficial posterior cerebral artery territory infarction in The Lausanne Stroke Registry.OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of clinical presentation, lesion topography, and etiology in patients with ischemic stroke limited to the superficial territory of the posterior cerebral artery (s-<e>PCA</e>). METHODS: In the Lausanne Stroke Registry (LSR, 1983-1998), we determined the patterns of clinical presentation, lesion topography and mechanisms of stroke, among 117 patients with s-PCA infarction (s-PCAI) on brain imaging. RESULTS: s-PCAIs accounted for 30.5 % of all PCA territory ischemic strokes. The presumed etiology was embolism in 64 (54.5 %) patients [cardiac in 51 (43.5 %) and arterial in 13 (11 %)], indeterminate in 38 (32 %), PCA atherothrombosis in 4 (3.4 %), migraine in 4 (3.4 %), other rare causes in 4 (3.4 %), and multiple potential sources of embolism in 3 (2.5 %). The clinical findings were hemianopsia in 78 (67 %), quadrantanopsia in 26 (22 %), and bilateral visual field defects in 8 (7 %). Motor, sensory, or sensorimotor deficits were detected in 14 (12 %), 8 (6.8 %), or 8 (6.8 %) patients, respectively. Neuropsychological dysfunction included memory impairment in 20 (17.5 %; with left [L], right [R], or bilateral [B] lesions in 15, 2, or 3 patients, respectively), dysphasia in 17 (14.5 %; L/B: 14/3), dyslexia with dysgraphia in 5 (4 %; L/B: 4/1), dyslexia without dysgraphia in 10 (8.5 %; L/B: 8/2), hallucinations in 12 (10 %; L/R/B: 5/5/2), visual neglect in 11 (9.5 %; L/R: 2/9), visual agnosia in 10 (8.5 %; L/B: 7/3), prosopagnosia in 7 (6 %; R/B: 4/3), and color dysnomia in 6 (5 %; L: 6). CONCLUSIONS: s-PCAIs are uncommon, representing less than a third of all PCA infarctions. Although embolism is the main cause in 60 % of patients, identification of the emboli source is often not possible. In 1/3 of cases, the stroke mechanism cannot be determined. Neuropsychological deficits are frequent if systematically searched for.",M2
11472388,"Altered cerebrovascular response pattern in interictal migraine during visual stimulation.A dysbalance of the cerebrovascular response during functional activation of the brain has been postulated as a factor in the pathophysiology of migraine. To determine the dynamic pattern of the cerebrovascular response in migraineurs compared with a control group, changes of the cerebral perfusion during cerebral activation were studied with high temporal resolution by functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD). The cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the right posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) and the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was measured simultaneously during visual stimulation in 19 interictal migraineurs and in 19 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Data were analysed with a previously validated technique based on automated stimulus-related averaging of the CBFV. The MCA migraineurs exhibited a steady increase of CBFV during the stimulation, while normal subjects showed a habituation of the CBFV response. The lack of habituation in migraineurs was significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) more pronounced across patients with a high attack frequency (&gt; or = 4 per month) compared with migraineurs with a low attack frequency (&lt; 4 per month). In the PCA, compared with normal subjects, migraineurs showed significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) stronger CBFV changes at the beginning and after the end of stimulation, with a slower decline to baseline. Data are in accordance with electrophysiological findings in migraineurs. It is assumed that a lack of habituation of the cerebrovascular response in migraineurs might contribute to a disturbance of the metabolic homeostasis of the brain that might induce migraine attacks.",M2
11338411,"Posterior cerebral artery Wada test: sodium amytal distribution and functional deficits.Inadequate sodium amytal delivery to the posterior hippocampus during the intracarotid Wada test has led to development of selective tests. Our purpose was to show the sodium amytal distribution in the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) Wada test and to relate it to functional deficits during the test. We simultaneously injected 80 mg sodium amytal and 14.8 MBq 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) into the P2-segment of the PCA in 14 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. To show the skull, we injected 116 MBq 99mTc-HDP intravenously. Sodium amytal distribution was determined by high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In all patients, HMPAO was distributed throughout the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus; it was also seen in the occipital lobe in all cases and in the thalamus in 11. Eleven patients were awake and cooperative; one was slightly uncooperative due to speech comprehension difficulties and perseveration. All patients showed contralateral hemianopia during the test. Four patients had nominal dysphasia for 1-3 min. None developed motor deficits or had permanent neurological deficits. Neurological deficits due to inactivation of extrahippocampal areas thus do not grossly interfere with neuropsychological testing during the test.",M2
11322121,"Specific characteristics and management strategies of cerebral artery aneurysms: report of eleven cases.Owing to the deep location of the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) and its close relationship with the brainstem and surrounding vital structures, surgical treatment of aneurysms in this region is complex. This study was undertaken in an attempt to better delineate the surgical risks of PCA aneurysms. A retrospective analysis was undertaken in 11 patients with PCA aneurysm surgically treated between 1988 and 1996 at Shinshu University and its affiliated hospitals. Data regarding surgical strategy, surgical complications and outcomes were analysed. Seven aneurysms were saccular (including one mycotic) and the other four were fusiform, dissecting, thrombosed and an infundibular dilatation. The locations of the aneurysms were at the P1 segment in two patients, P1-P2 junction in two, P2 segment in six and P3 segment in one. Six saccular non-mycotic aneurysms were treated with neck clipping and the other five aneurysms were treated each with proximal occlusion of the parent artery, excision of the aneurysm or wrapping. All aneurysms were satisfactorily exposed except one large saccular aneurysm. Surgical outcomes were either good recovery or moderate disability in 10 patients, and severe disability in one patient with a large aneurysm due to temporal lobe contusion. In conclusion it is the responsibility of the surgeon dealing with rare PCA aneurysms to be aware of these specific characteristics and to appreciate which surgical technique is appropriate for each patient.",M2
11189888,"Coil embolization of an incidental posterior cerebral artery aneurysm after initial OA-<e>PCA</e> bypass surgery.Aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) are rare and imply a variety of treatment modalities. We present a case of an incidental, nonruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm, which was successfully occluded by coil embolization after a bypass between the occipital artery and the distal posterior cerebral artery was created. MR imaging in a neurologically normal 26-year-old man, performed in the course of a work-up for nonrelated symptoms, incidentally revealed a partially thrombosed and calcified aneurysm of the left posterior cerebral artery (P2 segment). This was confirmed by angiography. Due to aneurysm configuration and localization in the asymptomatic patient, primary clipping or endovascular occlusion was considered to be too hazardous. Four weeks after successful microvascular connection of the left occipital artery to the distal posterior cerebral artery, the PCA was occluded at the level of the aneurysm with a detachable coil. The patient remained asymptomatic, without visual field defects. The above presented combined microvascular (bypass) and endovascular (coil embolization) treatment with excellent result should be considered as alternative in patients with nonruptured, asymptomatic P2 aneurysms, which are high risk for primary clipping or endovascular occlusion.",M2

The amplitude of the evoked flow response significantly decreased with age (r = -0.39; P &lt; 0.001). In a group of elderly subjects (60-81 years), the evoked blood flow velocity increase was 10.8 +/- 2.7%, which is less than in young subjects aged 20-39 years (14.7 +/- 4.3%; P = 0.001). We conclude that normal aging affects photoreactive flow changes in the occipital lobe.

The predilection of ADC changes within the PCA territory and in a previously undescribed watershed distribution supports the hypothesis that vasogenic edema in eclampsia is due to hypertension-induced failure of vascular autoregulation.",M2
11056022,"Evaluation of posterior cerebral artery blood flow with transcranial Doppler sonography: value and risk of common carotid artery compression.PURPOSE: Investigations of the posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCA</e>) by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) may be less reliable than investigations of the anterior part of the circle of Willis. Nevertheless, a true PCA may be identified by manual compression of the proximal common carotid artery (CCA) during TCD. Therefore, we used CCA compression in clinically indicated TCD studies and assessed retrospectively its risks and prospectively its benefits for PCA evaluations. METHODS: Using the transtemporal approach, we prospectively assessed flow velocities in posteriorly located blood vessels in 180 consecutive patients before and during CCA compression. The complications of CCA compression were retrospectively reviewed in all 3,383 clinical TCD investigations performed over an 8-year period. RESULTS: Decreased flow velocities during ipsilateral CCA compression occurred in 17% of patients. A PCA-like vessel with perfusion from the carotid artery or PCA supply from the carotid circulation was unmasked. Mixed distal PCA support by the posterior communicating artery and proximal PCA could not be shown by TCD. Transient cerebral symptoms occurred in less than 0.4% of the 3,383 retrospectively reviewed TCD investigations; no other adverse effects were seen. CONCLUSIONS: TCD without CCA compression may lead to false identification of the PCA. Since transient cerebral symptoms during CCA compression are rare, CCA compression can be used when a clinical TCD investigation of intracranial collateral blood flow compensation is indicated or when the identification of a cerebral artery is uncertain.",M2
10773642,"Posterior cerebral artery territory infarcts: clinical features, infarct topography, causes and outcome. Multicenter results and a review of the literature.Only a few large series of posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) stroke exist, and clinical features and causes have not been studied as extensively as in other vascular territories. The PCA syndrome includes more clinical signs than the well-known visual field deficits. Concomitant findings are frequently sensory, slight motor and neuropsychological deficits. Unilateral headaches are the common presenting symptom making complicated migraine an important differential diagnosis. Combined deep and superficial PCA territory infarcts involving the lateral thalamus are more frequent than commonly assumed and are mostly associated with sensory and reversible slight motor deficits. Occlusion of the precommunal PCA segment with associated paramedian midbrain infarction causes severe motor deficits, oculomotor signs, and decreased consciousness and has a poorer outcome than other PCA territory infarcts. Embolism from a cardiac or undetermined source is the leading mechanism accounting for up to half of the cases, whereas arterial embolism from significant proximal vertebrobasilar disease is less frequent. Local atherothrombotic stenosis or occlusion of the PCA is uncommon. In spite of thorough diagnostic evaluation, the etiology of PCA territory infarction cannot be determined in at least one quarter of patients. Among the rare causes of PCA territory infarction carotid artery disease is important while the significance of migraine remains controversial.",M2
10722908,"Evaluation of posterior cerebral artery flow velocity by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography.Using transcranial color-coded real-time sonography (TCCS), we measured peak-systolic flow velocities (PSVs) in segment P2 of 102 posterior cerebral arteries (<e>PCAs</e>) in 61 patients, with angiography. We divided 102 PCAs into four groups: control group (n = 70) with no significant stenotic lesions; PCS group (n = 7) with stenosis &gt;/= 50% of P2 segment; Col (+) group (n = 13) and Col (-) group (n = 12) had occlusive lesions in the carotid system with or without collateral flow from PCA to the middle cerebral artery through the leptomeningeal anastomosis. In the PCS group, PSV (255.7 +/- 67.2 cm/s) was higher than in the other three groups (p &lt; 0.0001). PSV was higher in the Col (+) group (127.6 +/- 31.2) than in the Col (-) (86.6 +/- 20.1) and control (83.8 +/- 24.8) groups (p &lt; 0.001). The measurement of PSV in the P2 segment of PCA using TCCS may help to identify a significant stenosis in PCA.",M2
10660030,"A case of posterior cerebral artery aneurysm associated with idiopathic bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion: case report.BACKGROUND: Aneurysms of the posterior circulation are challenging lesions to neurosurgeons, despite improvements in microsurgical techniques and advances in skull base approaches. We present a rare case of a posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>)-posterior communicating artery (PcomA) junction aneurysm associated with bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion successfully treated with an endovascular procedure. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female presented with sudden onset of severe headache and loss of consciousness. CT scan showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus. The patient developed severe neurogenic pulmonary edema and shock. Although her neurogenic pulmonary edema did not resolve, she recovered from shock. However, her general condition was so critical and her vital signs so unstable, that direct surgery under general anesthesia was considered too risky. A cerebral angiogram showed complete occlusion of both internal carotid arteries without any Moyamoya vessels. A saccular aneurysm located at the right PCA-PcomA junction was seen. To obliterate the aneurysm and prevent rerupture, the patient underwent coil embolization via an endovascular approach under sedation with local anesthesia. The balloon remodeling technique was useful to prevent occlusion of parent arteries. Finally, four interlocking detachable coils (IDC) with a total length of 44 cm were used to completely obliterate the aneurysm using the balloon remodeling technique. The patient made a full recovery after treatment and the aneurysm remained obliterated 2 years after coil embolization. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the advantages of the endovascular approach for the patient in critical condition. We believe that this is the first report of a PCA-Pcom junction aneurysm associated with bilateral ICA occlusion without moyamoya disease.",M2
10658935,"Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats lose their ability to auto-regulate cerebral blood flow prior to stroke.OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF) auto-regulation under hypertensive conditions could promote cerebrovascular over-perfusion and haemorrhage formation. The possibility that CBF auto-regulation becomes defective prior to haemorrhagic stroke development was assessed in Wistar- Kyoto stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) and related to the myogenic responsiveness of the cerebrovasculature to pressure. METHODS: Laser Doppler techniques were used to measure relative CBF in relation to mean arterial pressure (MAP 130-260 mmHg) within the perfusion domains of the middle (MCA) and posterior (<e>PCA</e>) cerebral arteries. The ability of isolated MCAs and PCAs to constrict to a 120 mmHg pressure step (pressure-dependent constriction) was measured using a pressure myograph. RESULTS: Two weeks prior to stroke, 10-week-old pre-stroke SHRsp exhibited near-constant CBF regulation to a 200 mmHg MAP. Thirteen-week-old pre-stroke SHRsp and age-matched post-stroke SHRsp lost their ability to auto-regulate CBF in the MCA and PCA perfusion domains. CBF increased at a high rate and in a linear manner with MAP. A distinct upper limit to CBF auto-regulation was absent. Pressure-dependent constriction was attenuated prior to stroke, and lost after stroke in isolated MCAs, but not the PCAs, of SHRsp. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of CBF auto-regulation prior to stroke in SHRsp could enhance cerebral perfusion and facilitate the initiation of haemorrhage. Such dysfunction after stroke could produce secondary haemorrhages. Defects in pressure-dependent constriction cannot fully account for the pattern of CBF auto-regulation loss observed in post-stroke SHRsp.",M2
10625908,"Distal calcarine fusiform aneurysm: a case report and review of literature.A 50 year old female who was operated for atrial septal defect 8 years back, presented with clinical features suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage (grade I, Hunt and Hess). CT scan of brain revealed haemorrhage in all the supratentorial basal cisterns, sylvian cistern and small haematoma in the left occipital lobe. Conventional CT and MR angiography revealed aneurysm in relation to distal part of the calcarine branch of the left posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>). Left occipital craniotomy in prone position followed by deep dissection in the occipital lobe showed fusiform aneurysm of the distal part of the calcarine branch. PCA aneurysms constitute only 0.2 to 1% of all intracranial aneurysms and among them distal PCA aneurysms are most rare, constituting only 1.3%. They too are mostly seen at the bifurcation of the PCA. The present case however, is unique in the sense that it has developed as a fusiform aneurysm in the distal part of the calcarine branch. To the best of our knowledge this is rare among the rarest.",M2
10500262,"Vasoneuronal coupling in migraineurs after subcutaneous sumatriptan: a TCD study.According to the trigeminovascular model of pain in migraine, sterile neurogenic inflammation of dural vessels stimulates nociceptive fibres of the trigeminal nerve. Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, blocks this reaction and mediates vasoconstriction of meningeal arteries. However, it is uncertain, whether sumatriptan also has a vasoconstrictive effect on cerebral arteries, which may influence vasoneuronal coupling and induce secondary cerebral blood flow changes. We studied changes of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and the pulsatility index (PI) in the posterior cerebral artery (<e>PCA</e>) after stimulus activation before, 10 min and 30 min after subcutaneous application of 6 mg sumatriptan, in order to assess potential vasoactive effects on cerebral circulation. CBFV was recorded from both PCAs simultaneously in 27 migraineurs (twenty women, seven men, mean age 29 years), and arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) were monitored. Although the mean diastolic blood pressure rose significantly from 75 mm Hg to 81 mm Hg (P&lt;0.05) and systolic blood pressure and respiration rates remained constant, average CBFV values remained constant. Similarly, the relative increase of CBFV by visual stimulation, which is clearly higher compared to controls in other studies (55.0% before, 52.6% after 10 min, and 52.4% after 30 min), and absolute mean values for CBFV and PI did not change after visual stimulation. These results provide evidence against the hypothesis that sumatriptan produces vasoconstriction in the intracranial human arterial circulation as a potential risk of cerebral ischemia.",M2
20394251,"Labor analgesia in preeclampsia: remifentanil patient controlled intravenous analgesia versus epidural analgesia.BACKGROUND: Epidural analgesia is considered to be the preferred method of labor analgesia in preeclamptic patients. Systemic opioids are another good effective, easy to administer alternative but may cause maternal and fetal respiratory depression. Remifentanil's rapid onset and offset of effects, should make it an ideal drug for the intermittent painful contraction during labor. Method. 30 preeclamptic patients were randomly assigned to one of two equal groups; Epidural Group: received epidural analgesia according to a standardized protocol using bupivacaine plus fentanyl. REMIFENTANIL GROUP: <e>PCA</e> was set up to deliver remlfentanil 0.5 microg/kg as a loading bolus infused over 20 seconds, lockout time of 5 minutes, PCA bolus of 0.25 microg/kg, continuous background infusion of 0.05 microg/kg/min, and maximum dose is 3 mg in 4 hours. Women were advised to start the PCA bolus when they feel the signs of a coming uterine contraction. RESULTS: All women demonstrated a significant decrease in VAS score in the first hour after administration of analgesia (P &lt; 0.05). Analgesic quality as regard Visual Analog Pain Scores, sedation score, and post-delivery patient satisfaction in both groups, are comparable (P &gt; 0.05). PCA remifentanil infusion until time of delivery produce no observable maternal, fetal or neonatal side effects (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: PCA intravenous remifentanil is an effective option for pain relief with minimal maternal and neonatal side effects in labor for preeclamptic patients with contraindications to epidural analgesia or requesting opioid analgesia.",M3
20375829,"Comparison of perioperative oral multimodal analgesia versus IV <e>PCA</e> for spine surgery.STUDY DESIGN: A preintervention and postintervention design was used to examine a total of 200 patients. OBJECTIVE: After successful implementation at our institution of a perioperative oral multimodal analgesia protocol in major joint arthroplasty, a modified regimen was provided to patients undergoing spine procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A proactive, multimodal approach is currently recommended for the management of acute postoperative pain. Inadequate postoperative analgesia can negatively influence surgical outcome and duration of rehabilitation. Routine use of intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA) after surgery can result in substantial functional interference, side effects, and lead to untoward events as a result of programming errors. METHODS: A preintervention and postintervention design was used to compare a historical control group of spine surgery patients who received conventional IV PCA (N=100) with a prospective group who received some form of perioperative oral multimodal analgesia (N=100). The new regimen included preoperative and postoperative scheduled extended-release oxycodone, gabapentin, and acetaminophen, intraoperative dolasetron and as-needed postoperative short-acting oral oxycodone. Patient surveys and chart audits were used to measure pain intensity, functional interference from pain, opioid consumption, analgesic-related side effects, and patient satisfaction over the first 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: Patients who received the new perioperative multimodal oral regimen had significantly less opioid consumption (P&lt;0.001), lower ratings of Least Pain (P&lt;0.01), and experienced less nausea (P&lt;.001), drowsiness (P&lt;0.05), interference with walking (P=0.05), and coughing and deep breathing (P&lt;0.05) compared with the IV PCA group. CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement study shows some safety and significant advantages of a multimodal perioperative oral analgesic regimen compared with standard IV PCA after spine surgery.",M3
20351978,"Recent advances in postoperative pain management.Good pain control after surgery is important to prevent negative outcomes such as tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, decrease in alveolar ventilation, and poor wound healing. Exacerbations of acute pain can lead to neural sensitization and release of mediators both peripherally and centrally. Clinical wind up occurs from the processes of N-Methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) activation, wind up central sensitization, long-term potentiation of pain (LTP), and transcription-dependent sensitization. Advances in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms have led to the development of multimodal analgesia and new pharmaceutical products to treat postoperative pain. The new pharmacological products to treat postoperative pain include extended-release epidural morphine and analgesic adjuvants such as capsaicin, ketamine, gabapentin, pregabalin dexmetomidine, and tapentadol. Newer postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) in modes such as intranasal, regional, transdermal, and pulmonary presents another interesting avenue of development.",M3
20297614,"The effect of intravenous opioid patient-controlled analgesia with and without background infusion on respiratory depression: a meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Although the addition of a background infusion for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-<e>PCA</e>) has been identified as a risk factor for the development of respiratory depression, this has not clearly been examined in a systematic fashion. The authors undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine whether the addition of a background or continuous infusion to an IV-PCA regimen would be associated with an increased risk of respiratory depression. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database (1966 to November 30, 2008). Inclusion criteria were a clearly defined analgesic technique of demand-only IV-PCA versus IV-PCA utilizing both a demand dose and background infusion, opioid medication used, and randomized trials. Data were abstracted and analyzed with the RevMan 4.2.7 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2004). RESULTS: The search yielded 687 abstracts from which the original articles were obtained and data abstracted with a total of 14 articles analyzed. There were 402 subjects in the continuous IV-PCA with demand group versus the 394 subjects in the demand-only IV-PCA group. Addition of a background infusion to the demand dose for IV-PCA with opioids was associated with a significant increased risk for respiratory depression (odds ratio [OR] = 4.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-18.21). Subgroup analysis revealed that this increased risk was seen in adult but not in pediatric patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that the addition of a continuous or background infusion to the demand dose for IV-PCA is associated with a higher incidence of respiratory events than demand IV-PCA alone in adult but not in pediatric patients; however, our overall results should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size and the wide range of definitions for respiratory depression in studies examined.",M3

20220746,"The influence of ondansetron on the analgesic effect of acetaminophen after laparoscopic hysterectomy.The 5-HT(3) antagonists tropisetron and granisetron have been shown to block the analgesic effect of acetaminophen in healthy volunteers. To study the interaction between ondansetron and acetaminophen in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy, we randomized 134 patients into three groups to receive acetaminophen-placebo (AP), acetaminophen-ondansetron (AO), or placebo-placebo (PP). One gram of intravenous acetaminophen or placebo was administered at the induction of anesthesia and every 6 h thereafter for 24 h, and 4 mg of ondansetron or placebo was administered at the end of surgery. Pain control was provided by patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>)-oxycodone. Acetaminophen (as compared to placebo) in periodic doses starting at induction of anesthesia reduced the total dosage of oxycodone required over 0-24 h (P = 0.031), but ondansetron given at the end of the surgery had no impact on the analgesic effect of acetaminophen (P = 0.723). The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores for pain were similar whether ondansetron or placebo was administered at the end of the surgery. Therefore, it may be concluded that in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy, the administration of periodic doses of intravenous acetaminophen (as compared to placebo) starting at induction of anesthesia reduces the total dose requirement of oxycodone, and a concomitant dose of a 5-HT(3) antagonist such as ondansetron at the end of the surgery does not block the analgesic effect of acetaminophen.",M3
20209411,"[Approaches taken by nurses in treating postoperative pain]OBJECTIVES: Surgery is recognized as an important cause of pain. Expression of pain differs according to age, developmental stage, previous pain experiences, and other modifying environmental factors. The degree of postoperative pain should be reduced using different techniques, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological. This study aimed to determine the effects of various actions taken by nurses for the purpose of pain management. METHODS: One hundred eighty-nine nurses working in the surgical ward were included in this study. A questionnaire was used to investigate demographic data and the actions taken by the nurses in the study group to alleviate pain. Results: The results showed that 146 of 189 nurses (77.2%) administered analgesic medication more often than employing other techniques for pain management. CONCLUSION: The other applications in pain management included patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>), massage, visual analog scale (VAS), and teaching relaxation techniques, helping with mobilization, and assessing vital signs.",M3
20207747,"Adding ketamine to morphine for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for acute postoperative pain: a qualitative review of randomized trials.In experimental trials, ketamine has been shown to reduce hyperalgesia, prevent opioid tolerance, and lower morphine consumption. Clinical trials have found contradictory results. We performed a review of randomized, double-blinded clinical trials of ketamine added to opioid in i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) for postoperative pain in order to clarify this controversy. Our primary aim was to compare the effectiveness and safety of postoperative administered ketamine in addition to opioid for i.v. PCA compared with i.v. PCA with opioid alone. Studies were identified from the Cochrane Library 2003, MEDLINE (1966-2009), and EMBASE (1980-2009) and by hand-searching reference lists from review articles and trials. Eleven studies were identified with a total of 887 patients. Quality and validity assessment was performed on all trials included using the Oxford Quality Scale with an average quality score of 4.5. Pain was assessed using visual analogue scales or verbal rating scales. Six studies showed significant improved postoperative analgesia with the addition of ketamine to opioids. Five studies showed no significant clinical improvement. For thoracic surgery, the addition of ketamine to opioid for i.v. PCA was superior to i.v. PCA opioid alone. The combination allows a significant reduction in pain score, cumulative morphine consumption, and postoperative desaturation. The benefit of adding ketamine to morphine in i.v. PCA for orthopaedic or abdominal surgery remains unclear. Owing to huge heterogeneity of studies and small sample sizes, larger double-blinded randomized studies showing greater degree of homogeneity are required to confirm these findings.",M3
20185654,"A national survey of American Pediatric Anesthesiologists: patient-controlled analgesia and other intravenous opioid therapies in pediatric acute pain management.BACKGROUND: The influence of patient characteristics, institutional demographics, and published practice guidelines on the provision of IV opioid analgesia, particularly as delivered through a patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) delivery device, to pediatric patients is unknown. METHODS: We sent a national, web-based, descriptive survey of pediatric pain management practice to select members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia to assess institutional demographics, availability and implementation of IVPCA and PCA by proxy, and recalled occurrence of serious and life-threatening opioid-related side effects. RESULTS: Data from respondents at 252 institutions throughout the United States were collected and analyzed. Sixty-nine percent of respondents practiced in a children's hospital or children's center within a general hospital, and 51% of institutions had a pediatric pain service. Virtually all pediatric pain services (91%) were administered by departments of anesthesiology. Pediatric pain service availability correlated with the number of pediatric beds. IVPCA was available to pediatric patients at 96% of institutions surveyed, whereas IVPCA by proxy was available at only 38%. Eleven percent of respondents reported that their hospital no longer provided IVPCA by proxy as a result of the 2004 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals Sentinel Event Warning. Instructional material concerning IVPCA was provided to patients or their families by 40% of institutions. IVPCA orders were handwritten by 55% of respondents, despite 39% having computerized provider order entry systems. Ninety percent of respondents reported using pulse oximetry monitoring when patients were administered IVPCA. Forty-two respondents recalled patients having received naloxone to counteract the cardiopulmonary side effects of opioids during the year before receipt of the survey. Eight respondents recalled patient deaths having occurred over the past 5 years in patients receiving IVPCA, IVPCA by proxy, and continuous non-IVPCA opioid infusions. CONCLUSIONS: Although IVPCA was available to pediatric patients at most institutions surveyed, prescribing practices and supervision of pediatric pain management were influenced by patient characteristics, institutional demographics, and published national guidelines. Recalled life-threatening events were reported in conjunction with all modes of opioid infusion therapy. Interventions that might diminish the incidence of adverse events but are not used to their fullest extent include improved education and implementation of systems designed to minimize human error involved in the prescribing of opioids. Providing a more accurate accounting of complications would require institutions to participate in a prospective data-collecting consortium designed to track both the incidence of therapy and associated complications.",M3

In this study, we aimed to present the efficacy and safety of our postoperative PCA treatment and the patient profile along with the requirements, preferences and decision-making process. METHODS: We discuss herein the PCA protocols of our clinic, the overall distribution of operations for which PCA was applied and the principles by which a pain team works. RESULTS: The operations for which PCA was applied included knee prosthesis, cesarean section, hip prosthesis, lower extremity trauma surgery, painless delivery, gastrointestinal surgery, multiple trauma surgery, thoracotomy, hysterectomy, laminectomy, and urogenital surgery. Postoperative PCA alone was successful in 89% of the patients, and with the supplemental analgesic agent, it was successful in an additional 6% of the patients, thus achieving a total success rate of 95%.

20124282,"Prospective, randomized, controlled trial of thoracic epidural or patient-controlled opiate analgesia on perioperative quality of life.BACKGROUND: Perioperative epidural analgesia provides continuous pain control and may have advantages over parenteral opiate administration. This study assessed the impact of epidural analgesia on quality of life (QOL) of patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing thoracic or thoraco-abdominal surgery were studied prospectively. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either thoracic epidural analgesia or patient-controlled i.v. opiate analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) after operation. Visual analogue pain and sedation scores were recorded for the period of the study. QOL health surveys at 24 h (SF-8 acute form) and at 1 week (SF-36) were recorded. Results were examined by uni- and multivariate analyses corrected for the effect of multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Mean pain scores were significantly lower in the epidural group at most time points. Physical and mental scores in the epidural group were significantly better than the PCA group for both SF-8 and SF-36 QOL health surveys (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic and opioid improves QOL and delivers better analgesia compared with PCA in patients undergoing major thoraco-abdominal surgery.",M3
20081257,"Preoperative tramadol combined with postoperative small-dose tramadol infusion after total abdominal hysterectomy: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.This double blind, randomized, controlled trial investigated whether a single preoperative intravenous (iv) dose of tramadol (100 mg) given 30 min before abdominal hysterectomy resulted in improved analgesic efficacy, reduced postoperative morphine patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) use and reduced side effects when combined with a postoperative small-dose tramadol infusion. Two-hundred twenty-four patients undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomly allocated to one of two groups: the tramadol group (n = 113) received iv tramadol (100 mg) 30 min before surgery, and the control group (n = 111) received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Upon awakening from general anesthesia, all patients received a loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg of tramadol and a small-dose infusion of tramadol (0.1 mg/kg/h) for 48 h. In addition, all patients were connected to morphine PCA delivering a morphine bolus of 0.02 mg/kg with a 6-min lock-out. Data on pain intensity at rest and during movement, morphine consumption, side-effects and overall patient satisfaction were recorded. A total of 189 patients completed the study. Preemptive tramadol was associated with superior analgesia at rest and with movement in the first 24 h after surgery (p &lt; 0.01), a longer interval to first morphine PCA request (p = 0.019), and reduced morphine PCA use (p = 0.017). The tramadol group had reduced nausea (p = 0.015), dizziness (p = 0.001) and drowsiness (p = 0.0001), while other side-effects were similar. In conclusion, a single dose of iv tramadol (100 mg) 30 min prior to abdominal hysterectomy improves analgesia, and reduces morphine PCA requirements, nausea, dizziness and drowsiness when combined with a postoperative small-dose tramadol infusion and morphine PCA when compared to the same analgesic regimen that omitted the preemptive tramadol.",M3
20051153,"[Practice guideline 'Pharmaceutical pain treatment during labour'; the woman's request is sufficient indication]The basic principle of the practice guideline 'Pharmaceutical pain treatment during labour' is that during labour every woman can have adequate pain treatment at her request. Most women experience severe pain during labour, but retrospective satisfaction also depends on the support of care-givers and on the extent to which the woman was involved in decisions relating to her situation. A number of medical indications require good pain management. Epidural analgesia is the safest and most effective method, preferably as patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). PCA with remifentanil appears promising, but remains to be adequately investigated. Pethidine is far less effective. Recommended organisational changes include structured provision of information on pharmaceutical pain management in the 30th week of pregnancy, to be developed by midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists. Other recommended changes include referral to another hospital for the treatment of choice, development of local protocols across primary and secondary care with agreements about out-patient referral to the anaesthetist, structured daily contact between obstetricians and anaesthetists, the time lapse between the request for pain treatment and the administration of the treatment, and the site of administration and monitoring.",M3
20008859,"Obstetric analgesia: a comparison of patient-controlled meperidine, remifentanil, and fentanyl in labour.BACKGROUND: To compare the analgesic efficacy of remifentanil with meperidine and fentanyl in a patient-controlled setting (patient-controlled analgesia, <e>PCA</e>). METHODS: Parturients (n=159) were randomly assigned to receive remifentanil (n=52), meperidine (n=53), or fentanyl (n=54). Pain scores and an observer sedation scores were assessed hourly. Fetal outcome was evaluated with Apgar score, cord blood gas analysis and the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Score. RESULTS: Pain scores decreased in all groups, the decrease varying from mild to moderate, average pain scores remaining above 4.5 cm in all groups. Remifentanil PCA was associated with the greatest decrease in pain scores, but the difference was significant only at 1 h. Pain scores returned towards baseline over time; 3 h after the initiation of treatment, pain scores no longer differed significantly from baseline values in any of the groups. Significantly more parturients receiving meperidine crossed over to epidural analgesia. Overall satisfaction scores were higher with remifentanil, but remifentanil produced more sedation and itching. More periods of desaturation (Sa(o(2)) &lt;95%) were observed during administration of remifentanil and fentanyl. There were no significant differences in fetal outcome between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of meperidine, fentanyl, and remifentanil PCA for labour analgesia varied from mild to moderate. Remifentanil PCA provided better analgesia than meperidine and fentanyl PCA, but only during the first hour of treatment. In all groups, pain scores returned to pre-treatment values within 3 h after the initiation of treatment.",M3
20006257,"Comparison of patient-controlled analgesia with and without dexmedetomidine following spine surgery in children.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with morphine. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison. SETTING: University-affiliated children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS: The medical charts of 131 children with idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and NMS who had major spine surgery were reviewed. Out of 131, postoperatively 94 children received PCA with morphine alone (PCA group) and the remaining 37 children received PCA morphine and dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.4 mcg/kg/hour for 24 hours (PCA + Dex group). Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative morphine use data were collected. MAIN RESULTS: Intraoperative use of morphine was similar in children with IS and NMS. However, patients with IS used more morphine than patients with NMS on the first, second and third postoperative days in both groups. In children with IS, use of morphine on the second postoperative day was significantly higher in the PCA + Dex group (73 mg [50.5, 110.5]) than the PCA alone group (54 mg [36, 69], P = 0.03). The overall frequency of all perioperative complications was more in the PCA alone group (40% vs. 32%) than the PCA + Dex group. CONCLUSION: Postoperative 24-hour dexmedetomidine infusion as an adjunct to PCA with opioids might have a morphine-sparing effect as evidenced by the increase in morphine use on postoperative day 2 after the dexmedetomidine infusion was stopped.",M3

The patients received 2.5 mg/ml levobupivacaine (Chirocaine) 15 ml or placebo in a double-blind manner through an indwelling catheter in the operation site every three hours for 45 hours. All patients were given oral paracetamol 1 g x 4 orally and morphine intravenously as patient-controlled analgesia. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the intensity of the postoperative pain. Amount of morphine used was recorded. The women in the levobupivacaine group (n=21) reported significantly less pain at rest during the first 15 hours postoperatively (p&lt;0.05). During mobilisation the intensity of pain was lower for the first six hours (p=0.01) and for the interval 18-24 hours (p=0.045) in the same group. Total mean (SD) consumption of opioids in the levobupivacaine and placebo groups was 24.6 mg (22.88) and 33.8 mg (30.82), respectively (p=0.28). After reconstruction, levobupivacaine injected locally every third hour as a supplement to paracetamol orally and morphine given by <e>PCA</e> resulted in improved pain relief at rest and during mobilisation. Morphine consumption was reduced, but this was not significant (p=0.28).",M3
19947072,"Can the cognitively impaired safely use patient-controlled analgesia?Although patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) is considered the standard in postoperative pain control, research examining PCA use among cognitively impaired older adults is lacking. The authors reviewed a case series of 10 adults aged 65 years and older admitted to the geriatrics or orthopedic services of an urban tertiary care center in New York City with acute pain and cognitive impairment or dementia who were administered PCA. Four patients from this cohort are presented in detail, demonstrating the challenges of PCA use in this population. A series of clinical pearls follows each case, outlining strategies for improving pain management. The authors' findings suggest that cognitive evaluations limited to alertness and orientation and failure to perform functional assessments may binder the identification of patients who are poor candidates for PCA. Once PCA has been initiated, clinicians must regularly review device use and document cognitive function and pain score patterns to identify PCA underuse or misuse. Finally, rapid fluctuations in cognitive or functional status may require adoption of a more flexible pain management strategy. Despite these challenges, a subset of cognitively impaired older adults can successfully understand and operate PCA devices. Additional research is needed to (1) develop screening tools for identifying and monitoring older adults who may benefit from PCA and (2) create innovative approaches for improving pain management in the cognitively impaired.",M3
19947071,"Meta-analysis of the effect of extended-release epidural morphine versus intravenous patient-controlled analgesia on respiratory depression.OBJECTIVE: Extended-release epidural morphine (EREM) is a single-dose, extended-release epidural morphine formulation intended to provide postoperative pain relief over a 48-hour period. There have been a few randomized controlled trials investigating the use and safety of EREM versus intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with opioids (IV-<e>PCA</e>); however, the adverse event of respiratory depression of this treatment is unclear. The authors have undertaken a meta-analysis to examine this issue. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database was conducted for terms related to EREM. Only randomized controlled trials, in the English language, assessing the rates of respiratory depression of EREM to IV-PCA were included for analysis. Data on pertinent study characteristics and relevant outcomes were extracted from accepted articles. Meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 4.2.7 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2004). A random effects model was used. RESULTS: The authors' literature search yielded three articles which met all inclusion criteria. All studied doses of EREM were evaluated. Pooled estimates (odds ratio) were made for rates of adverse events of respiratory depression. Use of EREM was associated with significantly higher odds of respiratory depression compared to IV-PCA (odds ratio = 5.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 30.54, p = 0.04). Even when examining only Food and Drug Administration approved dosages for EREM, the use of EREM was associated with significantly higher odds of respiratory depression when compared with IV-PCA (odds ratio = 5.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 31.93, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although perioperative single-dose epidural EREM (versus IV-PCA) was effective for postoperative pain relief for up to 48 hours, it is associated with significantly higher odds of respiratory depression. Further examination of the issue of respiratory depression of epidural EREM may be warranted.",M3
19947068,"Comparison of the effect of adding remifentanil to patient-controlled tramadol or morphine for postoperative analgesia after major abdominal surgery.OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors investigated the effect of the addition of remifentanil to tramadol or morphine for patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: The authors randomly allocated 133 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery to receive IV PCA with tramadol alone, tramadol plus remifentanil, morphine alone or morphine plus remifentanil. INTERVENTIONS: Bolus doses of tramadol (0.2 mg/kg), tramadol (0.2 mg/kg) plus remifentanil (0.2 microg/kg), morphine (0.02 mg/kg), or morphine (0.02 mg/kg) plus remifentanil (0.2 microg/kg) were available every 10 minutes without time limit or background infusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Discomfort, sedation, pain scores, side effects, and total and bolus tramadol and morphine consumption were recorded for up to 24 hours after the start of PCA. RESULTS: Pain scores at rest and movement were greater with tramadol alone than in the other groups at 1, 2, and 6 hours (p &lt; 0.0125). The addition of remifentanil reduced cumulative tramadol consumption at 6, 12, and 24 hours, but not morphine consumption. More patients required supplementary rescue analgesia with meperidine, and with greater dosage, with tramadol alone (p &lt; 0.001), and the incidence of nausea was greater with tramadol alone. The addition of remifentanil not only significantly improved discomfort scores in remifentanil groups, but also increased the degree of sedation in morphine-remifentanil group. CONCLUSIONS: After major abdominal surgery, adding remifentanil to PCA tramadol resulted in better pain scores, lower analgesic consumption, and fewer side effects when compared with tramadol alone. However, analgesic outcome with remifentanil was not prominent in MR group as much as in TR group.",M3
19933175,"I.V. infusion of magnesium sulphate during spinal anaesthesia improves postoperative analgesia.BACKGROUND: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective study, we have evaluated the effect of i.v. infusion of magnesium sulphate during spinal anaesthesia on postoperative analgesia and postoperative analgesic requirements. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing total hip replacement arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia were included. After the induction of spinal anaesthesia, the magnesium group (Group M) received magnesium sulphate 50 mg kg(-1) for 15 min and then 15 mg kg(-1) h(-1) by continuous i.v. infusion until the end of surgery. The saline group (Group S) received the same volume of isotonic saline over the same period. After surgery, a patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) device containing morphine and ketorolac was provided for the patients. Postoperative pain scores, PCA consumption, and the incidences of shivering, postoperative nausea, and vomiting were evaluated immediately after surgery, and at 30 min, 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery. Serum magnesium concentrations were checked before the induction of anaesthesia, immediately after surgery, and at 1 and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in Group M at 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery (P&lt;0.05). Cumulative postoperative PCA consumptions were also significantly lower in Group M at 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery (P&lt;0.05). Postoperative magnesium concentrations were higher in Group M (P&lt;0.05 at 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery), but no side-effects associated with hypermagnesemia were observed. Haemodynamic variables and the incidences of shivering, nausea, and vomiting were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: I.V. magnesium sulphate administration during spinal anaesthesia improves postoperative analgesia.",M3

19807886,"Parent-assisted or nurse-assisted epidural analgesia: is this feasible in pediatric patients?AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of parent-assisted or nurse-assisted epidural analgesia (PNEA) for control of postoperative pain in a pediatric surgical population. METHODS: After the institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained, an analysis of our pain treatment services database of pediatric surgical patients with epidural catheters in whom the parent and/or nurse were empowered to activate the epidural demand-dose button was evaluated. RESULTS: Over a 10 -year period between 1999 and 2008, 128 procedures in 126 patients were provided parent or nurse assistance of the epidural demand dose. Satisfactory analgesia was obtained in 86% of patients with no or minor adjustments in PNEA parameters. Fourteen percent of patients were converted to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) for inadequate analgesia (7%) or side effects (7%). None of the patients in this cohort required treatment for respiratory depression or excessive sedation. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-assisted or nurse-assisted epidural analgesia can be safely administered to children undergoing surgery who are physically or cognitively unable or unwilling to self-activate a demand dose. Additional studies are needed to compare the efficacy of PNEA with other modalities for postoperative pain control in children.",M3
19794994,"Is intravenous patient controlled analgesia enough for pain control in patients who underwent thoracoscopy?This prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of two common analgesic techniques, thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia (Epidural <e>PCA</e>), and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA), in patients undergoing lobectomy by the video-assisted thoracic surgical (VATS) approach. Fifty-two patients scheduled for VATS lobectomy were randomly allocated into two groups: an Epidural PCA group receiving an epidural infusion of ropivacaine 0.2%+fentanyl 5 microg/mL combination at a rate of 4 mL/hr, and an IV PCA group receiving an intravenous infusion of ketorolac 0.2 mg/kg+fentanyl 15 microg/mL combination at a rate of 1 mL/hr. Pain scores were then recorded using the visual analogue scale at rest and during motion (VAS-R and VAS-M, 0-10) for five days following surgery. In addition, we measured the daily morphine consumption, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), satisfaction score, and the incidence of side effects. Thirty-seven patients out of 52 completed the study (18 in the Epidural PCA group, 19 in the IV PCA group). There were no differences in the pain scores, analgesic requirements, pulmonary function, satisfaction score, and the incidence of side effects between groups. This indicates that IV PCA and Epidural PCA are equally effective to control the postoperative pain after VATS lobectomy, which suggests that IV PCA may be used instead of Epidural PCA.",M3
19784640,"CYP3A4*1G genetic polymorphism influences CYP3A activity and response to fentanyl in Chinese gynecologic patients.PURPOSE: To investigate whether the CYP3A4*1G genetic polymorphism contributes to the variability in CYP3A activity and response to fentanyl. METHODS: One hundred and forty-three gynecologic patients who were scheduled to undergo abdominal total hysterectomy or myomectomy with general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Intravenous fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia was provided postoperatively for satisfactory analgesia. The degrees of pain at rest during <e>PCA</e> treatment were assessed with visual analog scale. The fentanyl consumption and occurrence of any adverse effects were recorded in the first 24 h postoperatively. CYP3A activity was measured by plasma 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to-midazolam ratio 1 h after intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg midazolam. CYP3A4*1G variant allele was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: The frequency of the CYP3A4*1G variant allele was 0.269 in 143 Chinese gynecologic patients. The activity of CYP3A4 in patients homozygous for the *1G/*1G variant (0.34 +/- 0.15) was significantly lower than that in patients bearing the wild-type allele (*1/*1) (0.46 +/- 0.14) or in patients heterozygous for the *1/*1G variant (0.46 +/- 0.12) (P &lt; 0.05). The patients with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype needed less fentanyl (227.8 +/- 55.2 microg) to achieve pain control than patients carrying the CYP3A4*1/*1 (381.6 +/- 163.6 microg) and CYP3A4*1/*1G (371.9 +/- 180.1 microg) genotypes (P &lt; 0.05) during the first 24 h postoperatively. There was no significant difference in incidence of adverse events among the different genotype groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4*1G genetic polymorphism decreases CYP3A activity and fentanyl consumption for postoperative pain control.",M3
19783285,"Perioperative outcomes comparing patient controlled epidural versus intravenous analgesia in gynecologic oncology surgery.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare perioperative patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) versus patient controlled intravenous analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) after gynecologic oncology laparotomy. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study where perioperative pain management was decided through patient-centered discussion by anesthesia and surgical teams. The study was designed to accrue 224 patients, to test for equivalence in pain control on postoperative day 1, defined as less than a 10% difference in the proportion of patients with a visual analog scale pain score of &lt;2 (0-10 scale). RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were enrolled, with 205 patients evaluable for outcomes: 98 received PCA, while 107 received a thoracic level PCEA. Utilization of PCEA was associated with longer anesthesia time pre-op (means: 60 vs. 44 min, p&lt;0.0001), as well as more likely use of pressors during surgery (78% vs. 57%, p=0.002). Pain control was comparable between groups on postoperative day 1 (mean VAS: 2.4 vs. 2.5, p=0.56), but patients with PCEA tended to require more supplemental pain medications. Time to first ambulation was longer in the PCEA patients (means: 49 vs. 36 h post-op, p=0.03), with no difference in time to tolerating regular diet (means: 89 vs. 77 h post-op, 0.17) and no difference in readiness for discharge (means: 144 vs. 145 h post-op, p=0.95).

19723272,"Postoperative pain assessment with three intensity scales in Chinese elders.PURPOSE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R), the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), and the Iowa Pain Thermometer (IPT) for pain assessment in Chinese elders who have had surgery. DESIGN: A descriptive correlational design with repeated measures was used. A convenience sample of 180 Chinese elders (age range 65 to 95 years) undergoing scheduled surgery at a university-affiliated hospital was recruited. METHODS: On the day before surgery, recalled pain and anticipated postoperative pain intensity were rated by patients with three scales presented in randomized order, and then cognitive function was measured. On the first 3 postoperative days, participants completed the three scales in random order to assess current, worst, and least pain on each day. On the 3rd postoperative day, single retrospective ratings on worst, least, and average pain over the 3 days for each scale were also obtained and scale preferences were investigated. FINDINGS: The failure rates for all three scales were extremely low. The intraclass correlation coefficients across current, worst, and least pain on each postoperative day were consistently high (0.949 to 0.965), and all scales at each rating were strongly correlated (r=.833 to .962). Pain scores significantly decreased during the 3 postoperative days and all three scales were found to be sensitive in evaluating patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) efficacy. The scale mostly preferred was the IPT (54.7%), followed by the FPS-R (28.5%) and the NRS (15.6%). No significant differences were noted in participant preference by age and cognitive status, but preference for the IPT and the FPS-R were significantly related to gender and education level. CONCLUSIONS: Although all three scales show good reliability, validity, and sensitivity for assessing postoperative pain intensity in Chinese elders, the IPT appears to be a better choice based on patient preference. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The FPS-R, the NRS, and the IPT can be used confidently to assess postoperative pain in Chinese surgical elders.",M3
19716489,"Patient-controlled analgesia in orthognathic surgery: evaluation of the relationship to anxiety and anxiolytics.BACKGROUND: Although patient-controlled analgesia' (<e>PCA</e>) use has been reported in oral and maxillofacial surgery,(8) it has not been evaluated for use in orthognathic surgery. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between age, gender, and preoperative anxiety and postoperative morphine intake after orthognathic surgery in the PCA environment. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-one patients (34 female, 17 male) underwent orthognathic surgery. Patients' anxiety was evaluated preoperatively. All patients received morphine-based postoperative PCA. Relationship between preoperative anxiety and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) and 24 hour morphine intake was evaluated. Patients were randomly grouped according to whether preoperative oral anxiolytics were prescribed. RESULTS: Age and VAS were correlated, as well as preoperative anxiety score and postoperative morphine intake (P &lt; .05). Female patients receiving anxiolytics before surgery had less morphine consumption than those who did not. CONCLUSION: Preoperative anxiety directly influences postoperative PCA morphine intake. Anxiolytics preoperatively seem to reduce the need for postoperative analgesics.",M3
19706349,"Patients' assessment of the convenience of fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS) versus morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV <e>PCA</e>) in the management of postoperative pain after major surgery.The patient-controlled fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS) is a compact, self-contained, needle-free system that has been approved for acute postoperative pain management in hospitalized adults. The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate patients' assessment of fentanyl ITS and morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) convenience on 7 different subscales, using a validated patient ease of care (EOC) questionnaire in 2 prospective, open-label, randomized, phase IIIb clinical trials. Patients received fentanyl ITS or morphine IV PCA (N = 1,305) for up to 72 h after total hip replacement surgery (THR study) or abdominal or pelvic surgery (APS study). For the majority of items on the patient EOC questionnaire, trends suggest that greater percentages of patients reported the most positive response for fentanyl ITS than they did for morphine IV PCA in both studies; differences were particularly noteworthy for items on the Movement subscale. In the THR study, more patients in the fentanyl ITS group were responders compared with those in the morphine IV PCA group for the subscales Confidence with Device, Pain Control, Knowledge/Understanding, and Satisfaction. In the APS study, responder rates for these subscales did not differ between treatment groups. These findings indicate that patients assessed the EOC associated with fentanyl ITS higher compared with morphine IV PCA for the management of acute postoperative pain and suggest that fentanyl ITS has the potential to improve acute postoperative pain care for patients and nurses.",M3
19700988,"Epidural analgesia compared with intravenous analgesia after pediatric posterior spinal fusion.BACKGROUND: Pain management remains challenging for pediatric patients after posterior spinal fusion (PSF). This study compares the effectiveness of hydromorphone and bupivacaine administered through patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with hydromorphone patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (IV-<e>PCA</e>) in this population. METHODS: Patients aged 8 to 18 years undergoing PSF for idiopathic scoliosis were randomized to receive either PCEA (0.1% bupivacaine plus hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL at 8 mL/h plus bolus dosing) or IV-PCA (hydromorphone 2 mcg/kg/h continuous infusion; 2 mcg/kg bolus dose). Pain scores, severity of muscle spasms, and analgesic doses were recorded for 3 postoperative days (PODs). Adverse events were followed until discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were included (19 PCEA and 19 IV-PCA). Seven in the PCEA group (37%) experienced early epidural failure, and 2 in the IV-PCA group remained intubated, sedated, and ventilated for several hours postoperatively; these patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. All data are presented as  per protocol  unless otherwise specified. Pain scores were significantly lower on days 2 and 3 (P &lt; or = 0.042). Eight percent of the patients who received PCEA experienced moderate-to-severe spasms through POD 3 compared with 35% of those in the IV-PCA group (P=NS). Seven (58%) patients in the PCEA group and 17 (100%) in the IV-PCA group required diazepam (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Epidural catheters provide modestly improved analgesia in patients after PSF for idiopathic scoliosis. However, the high failure rate in this population emphasizes a need for a close assessment for adequate blockade early in the recovery period. This study provides an excellent platform on which to build future trials that could include increased baseline dosing for the epidural medications, radiographic confirmation of catheter placement, and dual catheter techniques toward the goal of improving pain control in these patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2, randomized, controlled trial.",M3
19697825,"[Patient-controlled continuous epidural analgesia vs intravenous remifentanil infusion for labour anaesthesia]BACKGROUND: Although epidural anaesthesia has become a standard method for labour analgesia all over the world, it is far from being ideal because of side effects and contraindications. Many alternative techniques have therefore been proposed, including the continuous infusion of remifentanil. Encouraged by positive reports, we compared the efficacy of patient-controlled remifentanil infusion (<e>PCA</e>) with patient-controlled continuous epidural analgesia (PCEA). METHODS: Fifty-two ASA I and II parturients were arbitrarily allocated, without randomisation, to two groups to receive PCEA with 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2 microg kg(-1) fentanyl (basic infusion 1 mL h(-1), bolus 4 mL, lock-out time 15 min) or remifentanil PCA (0.2 microg kg(-1) bolus doses, without basic infusion, lock-out time 2 min). The intensity of pain was assessed using the VAS scale every 15 min in the PCEA group and every 10 min in the PCA group. RESULTS: During the first two hours of labour, the VAS score was significantly lower in the PCEA group. Later there was no difference between the groups. The clinical status of the newborns was similar. CONCLUSION: The results are difficult to interpret since there was no randomisation and parturients participated in decisions about allocation to one of the study groups. Analgesia provided by remifentanil was assessed as highly acceptable by the patients and the drug can be regarded as a safe alternative to epidural analgesia during labour.",M3
19685108,"Effects of intravenous adenosine 5'-triphosphate on intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative pain in patients undergoing major orofacial surgery: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.PURPOSE: We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of the intraoperative intravenous infusion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) on intraoperative hemodynamics and postoperative pain in patients undergoing major orofacial surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients (age, 16-42 years; 16 males/14 females) scheduled for sagittal split ramus osteotomy were assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive intraoperative intravenous infusion of ATP (n = 15) or saline (n = 15). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium. Local anesthesia was added for intraoperative analgesia. In the ATP group, ATP was infused at a rate of 160 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) throughout surgery. Postoperative pain was managed with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with morphine. The intensity of postoperative pain was assessed with a verbal numeric rating scale (NRS). Morphine consumption was also assessed. RESULTS: There were no differences in demographic, anesthetic, and surgical data between the ATP and placebo groups. Intraoperatively, ATP effectively suppressed responses of blood pressure and heart rate to painful surgical stimuli. There were no differences in postoperative NRS scores between the two groups. However, postoperative morphine consumption was significantly less in the ATP group, compared with the placebo group, throughout the 72-h postoperative observation period. Cumulative morphine consumption for 72 h postoperatively was 47% less with ATP, compared with placebo. No adverse effect of ATP was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intraoperative ATP infusion can blunt hemodynamic responses to surgical stimuli and produce prolonged analgesia in patients undergoing major orofacial surgery.",M3
19672166,"Does postoperative delirium limit the use of patient-controlled analgesia in older surgical patients?BACKGROUNDPostoperative pain Is an independent predictor of postoperative delirium. Whether postoperative delirium limits patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) use has not been determined. METHODS: The authors conducted a nested cohort study in older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and used PCA for postoperative analgesia. Delirium was measured by using the Confusion Assessment Method. The authors computed a structural equation model to determine the effects of pain and opioid consumption on delirium status and the effect of delirium on opioid use. RESULTS: Of 335 patients, 108 (32.2%) developed delirium on postoperative day (POD) 1, and 120 (35.8%) on POD 2. Postoperative delirium did not limit the use of PCA. Patients with postoperative delirium used more PCA in a 24-h period (POD 2) compared to those without delirium (mean dose of hydromorphone +/- SE adjusted for covariates was 2.24 +/- 0.71 mg vs. 1.25 +/- 0.67 mg, P = 0.02). Despite more opioid use, patients with delirium reported higher Visual Analogue Scale scores than those without delirium (POD 1: mean visual analog scale +/- SE at rest 4.2 +/- 0.23 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.22, P = 0.0051; POD 2: 3.3 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.19, P = 0.004). Path coefficients from structural equation model revealed that pain and opioid use affect delirium status, but delirium does not affect subsequent opioid dose. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative delirium did not limit PCA use. Despite more opioid use, visual analog scale scores were higher in patients with delirium. Future studies on delirium should consider the role of pain and pain management as potential etiologic factors.",M3
19671221,"Comparison of epidural and intravenous patient controlled analgesia in patients undergoing radical cystectomy.OBJECTIVE: Postoperative analgesia is an important factor influencing surgical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the role of patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) versus intravenous (IV) patient controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. METHODS: We reviewed data from consecutive patients who had a radical cystectomy at our institution between 2003 and 2007 to evaluate the effect of either PCEA or IV PCA on the patients' postoperative pain--the primary outcome--as well as secondary outcomes including time to begin eating solid food, time to ambulation, and length of hospital stay. The patients received either hydromorphone or morphine via IV PCA, or bupivacaine and hydromorphone or ropivacaine via PCEA. Pooled t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare outcomes. A mixed model regression analysis was used to compare pain scores. RESULTS: Data was analyzed from 131 patients to compare 73 patients (56%) who received PCEA versus 58 patients (44%) who received IV PCA. No significant differences in patient mobilization, progress to eating solid food, or length of hospital stay were detected, although there was a trend for earlier progress to eating solid food for patients in the PCEA group (p = 0.09). Using a mixed model analysis, we found no significant difference in pain scores at rest (p = 0.11). However, pain scores during activity were significantly lower for patients in the PCEA group, (p = 0.02), with a significant interaction effect (p = 0.03), indicating that the benefit with PCEA occurred in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that compared with IV PCA, PCEA for radical cystectomy patients can result in lower immediate postoperative pain during activity, with a trend to earlier progress to eating solid foods, but no shortening of hospital stay.",M3
19664944,"Rhythmic pattern of <e>PCA</e> opioid demand in adults with cancer pain.INTRODUCTION: Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has an established role in managing postoperative pain and has been successfully used in-patients with cancer pain. The variation of opioid requirement over a 24h period for patients with cancer pain is debated with suggestions of reduced need over night. METHODS: Retrospective review of 10years (1997-2006) data of all in-patients with cancer pain treated with strong opioids delivered by PCA. RESULTS: 141 patients with cancer pain had a mean cumulative 10day morphine equivalent dose per patient of 671mg (median 470mg; range 10-2170mg). At night (10:01pm to 06:00am) the patient's self administered less bolus doses (69mg, (25%)) than during the other two 8h periods (06:01am to 02:00pm, 91mg (33%) and 02:01pm to 10:00pm, 116mg (42%)). In 8 out of 10days a significant variation in bolus requests was observed with significantly less bolus requests during the night (Friedman test, p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the median number of delivered bolus requests per patient, at night, was 2-3 compared to the morning and afternoon periods of 3-7 and 3.5-6, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCA met individual patient's opioid needs in a safe and effective manner despite a large inter-individual variability in opioid consumption. Moreover, the study indicated a pattern of less opioid requirement at night.",M3
19635216,"Remifentanil combined with low-dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia of lower limb fracture: a double-blind, controlled study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the adjuvant effect of intraoperative and postoperative low-dose ketamine administration to remifentanil consumption in patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) for lower limb fracture. METHODS: A total of 200 patients with lower limb fracture receiving the surgery were randomly divided into 4 groups. In Groups A, B and C, patients received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion under general anesthesia, and ketamine in a dose of 0.1 mg/ kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.01 mg/kg per hour continuously for 24 hours after surgery, respectively. The control group (Group D) received an equivalent volume of normal saline only. With 20 microgram/ml remifentanil in normal saline, postoperative PCA was administered with a background infusion at 2 ml/h following 2 ml as a loading dose and 1ml demand dose with a 3-minute lockout period. Remifentanil consumption, 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) scores, global satisfaction score (GSS), and side effects were also recorded by the acute pain service. RESULTS: Cumulative PCA remifentanil consumption in Groups A and B were (1378+/-77) microgram and (1531+/-402) microgram, significantly lower than (1807+/-510) microgram and (1838+/-523) microgram in Groups C and D (P&lt;0.01). VAS scores in Groups A and B were significantly lower than those in Groups C and D (P&lt;0.01). In the first 12 hours after operation, GSS was improved (P&lt;0.01). No respiratory depression was observed. No significant difference in side effects was observed among groups. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine can relieve postoperative pain and moderately decrease remifentanil consumption for PCA, with no obvious side effects of ketamine.",M3
19624630,"Bacterial contamination of <e>PCA</e> and epidural infusion devices.We prospectively audited the bacterial contamination of re-usable analgesia infusion pumps. In a one-month period, 112 samples from the handset and keypads of our analgesia infusion pumps were cultured for bacterial contamination. Forty-five percent of handset swabs and 46% of keypad swabs grew bacteria; the commonest organism being coagulase-negative staphylococcus. An additional cleaning step using 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes was introduced and the contamination rate was re-audited in 100 samples. The contamination rate was reduced to 6% of handset swabs and 4% of keypad swabs. A high initial rate of bacterial contamination of re-usable analgesia infusion pumps was significantly reduced by the implementation of a simple, additional cleaning procedure.",M3
19619108,"[Comparing the effects of analgesia techniques with controlled intravenous and epidural on postoperative pain and knee rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty]OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the effects of controlled intravenous (iv.) and epidural analgesia techniques on postoperative analgesia and knee rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: After the approval of the ethical committee, both i.v. (group I.V; n=20) and epidural (group E; n=22) postoperative analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) were applied in 42 patients (range 18 to 75 years) undergoing TKA. Because of dislocation of epidural catheters in the postoperative period, two cases were excluded from the study and 20 patients in each group were evaluated. Postoperative pain was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS) and it was recorded in the recovery unite and then at the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 24th, 48th and 72nd hours. The knee flexion angles of patients were daily measured with a goniometer. The data were analyzed using Mann Whitney U-test, two-samples independent t-test, Fisher exact-chi squared and Pierson chi squared tests. RESULTS: Demographic variables were similar in two groups. In group E, VAS scores at rest and motion were found to be significantly lower and knee flexion angles were significantly higher than that of the group I.V. CONCLUSION: We determined that epidural PCA provided better pain relief and rehabilitation than iv. PCA in postoperative period after TKA.",M3

19594851,"Intranasal ketorolac for postoperative pain: a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study.OBJECTIVE: Analgesic efficacy and tolerability of intranasal (IN) ketorolac was evaluated in postoperative patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Patients received IN ketorolac (30 mg) or placebo three times daily for up to 5 days, with access to morphine by patient controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). Patients in a single-dose phase were removed from PCA 3 hours prior to the first study dose the day after surgery, and received a single IN ketorolac or placebo dose when visual analog scale scores were &gt; or =40. RESULTS: Three hundred patients (N = 199 ketorolac, N = 101 placebo) were enrolled following primarily hysterectomies (135/300, 45%) and hip replacements (100/300, 33%); 189 (N = 115 ketorolac, N = 74 placebo) entered the single-dose phase. Mean age was 52 years (range 19-81) and 69% of patients were women. The primary efficacy endpoint, the single-dose summed pain intensity difference score at 6 hours, was significantly higher in the ketorolac group compared with placebo (83.3 vs 37.2, P &lt; 0.007), indicating greater pain reduction with ketorolac. Morphine use was reduced by 34% in the ketorolac group compared with the placebo group. The incidence of adverse events ( approximately 98%) was similar in the two groups. The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea and vomiting. There was a trend in the ketorolac group for a lower incidence of opioid-related side effects such as constipation and pruritus. Nasal irritation occurred more frequently with ketorolac vs placebo (24% vs 2%). CONCLUSION: IN ketorolac was well tolerated and effective in treating moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in inpatients; the convenience of IN dosing suggests that its usefulness in the ambulatory care setting should be evaluated.",M3
19586828,"Combination of low-dose nalbuphine and morphine in patient-controlled analgesia decreases incidence of opioid-related side effects.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The addition of ultra-low-dose naloxone to patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with morphine reduces opioid-related side effects. Nalbuphine, a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist, may be able to attenuate opioid-related side effects. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of combined low-dose nalbuphine and morphine in PCA for postoperative pain control after gynecological surgery. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, controlled study enrolled 174 female patients who were undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy, myomectomy, or ovarian tumor excision. In the control group, the PCA formula was 1 mg/mL pure morphine. In the study group, the PCA formula was 1 mg/mL morphine and 10 microg/mL nalbuphine (1:100). Numerical rating score, PCA requirement, nausea, vomiting, use of antiemetics, pruritus, use of antipruritics, and opioid-related adverse events were investigated at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-nine patients completed the study: 86 in the control group and 83 in the study group. The incidence of nausea was lower in the study group (41%) than in the control group (65%). The incidence of vomiting, use of antiemetics, pruritus, and use of antipruritics did not differ between the two groups. The numerical rating pain score and PCA requirements were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Combination of low-dose nalbuphine and morphine in PCA decreases the incidence of opioid-related nausea, without affecting the analgesia and PCA requirement. This novel combination can improve the quality of PCA used for postoperative pain control after gynecological surgery.",M3

METHODS: Thirty ASAI-II patients, aged 35-65, weighing 42-75 kg, with visual analogue score&gt;or=3, undergoing elective radical operation for esophageal carcinoma under general anesthesia received intravenous morphine 2 - 3 mg were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: group m receiving morphine 0.02 mg.kg(-1).h(-1), and with group mk receiving morphine 0.02 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) combined with ketamine 0.08 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) for 50 h. In the course of treatment the patients received intravenous injection of morphine 2-3 mg when the VAS was &gt;or=3. VAS was recorded 4, 8, 20, 24, and 48 h after operation. The amount of morphine used after operation, PCA button pressing times (effective/active), side effects, and vital signs including pulse, saturation of blood oxygen, respiratory rate, heart rate, and average arterial pressure were recorded. Central venous blood samples were collected when entering the operation room (T0), by the end of operation (T1), and 6 h (T2), 24 h (T3), and 48 h (T4) after operation respectively to examine the beta-endorphin level. RESULTS: During the period 4-48 h after operation the VAS scores of the group mk were significantly lower than those of the group m in activity state (all P&lt;0.05) and were not significantly different those of the group m at resting state (all P&gt;0.05). The total amount of morphine consumed and the actual PCA button pressing times were significantly less in the group mk than in the group m (both P&lt;0.05). The incidence rates of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus of the group mk were all significantly lower than those of the group m (all P&lt;0.05). There were not significant differences in the incidence rates of dreaming and pseudoesthesia between these 2 groups. All the vital signs were stable in the 2 groups. The plasma beta-EP levels at the time point T1 of these 2 groups were both significantly higher than those at T0 (both P&lt;0.05). The plasma beta-endorphin levels at T2-4 of the group mk decreased gradually from the level at T1 to the level at T0, and the plasma beta-endorphin levels of the group m rapidly decreased from the level at T0 to the T0 level and remained at this level to the 48 h after operation. CONCLUSION: The combination of small dose of ketamine with morphine provides optimal analgesia with low side-effect rate and little effect on the plasma beta-EP level.",M3
19562535,"[The effects of two different multimodal analgesic regimens in total hip replacement surgery]OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effectiveness of two different multimodal analgesia protocols in terms of postoperative pain relief, tramadol consumption during patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) and side effects after total hip replacement surgery. METHODS: Group F (n=18) received general anesthesia after a 3-in-1 femoral nerve block (FNB) was applied using 40 ml of bupivacaine 0.25%. Group FD (n=18) received general anesthesia after the same block and dexketoprofen p.o. was given. All patients received intravenous tramadol at the end of surgery via a PCA device. Group FD was given dexketoprofen 75 mg/day for 48 hours postoperatively. Pain scores were evaluated at 0, 1/2, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48h at rest and on movement of the hip. Side effects and global satisfaction scores in both groups were also evaluated in this setting. RESULTS: Total tramadol consumption was lower in Group FD (377.7+/-137.4) than in Group F (593.9+/-132.3) (p&lt;0.05). Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were &lt;/=3 in all follow-up periods in both groups. While in Group FD, 6 patients had nausea, 3 vomiting and 1 sedation, in Group F, 5 patients had nausea, 3 vomiting and 2 sedation. Patient global satisfaction scores in Group F were very good in 14 patients and good in 4 patients, and in Group FD were very good in 13 patients and good in 5 patients. CONCLUSION: Both analgesia protocols were effective in pain relief in total hip replacement patients, with similar side effects. The effect of additional dexketoprofen was to reduce postoperative tramadol consumption.",M3
19549643,"Influence of patient-controlled i.v. analgesia with opioids on supraventricular arrhythmias after pulmonary resection.BACKGROUND: Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) are common after pulmonary resection and autonomic imbalance is thought to be one of the triggers. Opioids can increase parasympathetic activity and may balance heightened sympathetic tone after operation. We have examined the effect of postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with opioids on postoperative SVA. METHODS: Forty-eight patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The GA group received general anaesthesia PCA and PCA with opioids (fentanyl 6 microg ml(-1) and tramadol 3 mg ml(-1)). The GEA group received combined general/epidural anaesthesia plus patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Holter recording was completed for 12 h before operation and 12 and 48 h after operation. The incidence of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs) was evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative SVT was significantly lower in the GA group than in the GEA group (3/22 vs 10/22, P=0.021). The incidence of postoperative SVEBs was not statistically different between the groups, but the frequency of postoperative SVEBs increased less in the GA than the GEA group (7/22 vs 15/22, P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: PCA with opioids (fentanyl and tramadol) can reduce postoperative SVA after pulmonary resection compared with PCEA with ropivacaine.",M3
19530742,"Patient-controlled analgesia-related medication errors in the postoperative period: causes and prevention.Patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) is a common and effective means of managing postoperative pain. Unfortunately, the complex processes and equipment associated with the setup, programming and administration of intravenous or epidural PCA have allowed it to become a significant source of preventable medication errors. These errors can be classified into two major categories: human (operator) errors and equipment errors (malfunctions). Such errors are potentially harmful to patients, time-consuming for hospital staff and costly for healthcare providers. The objective of this article is to describe PCA medication errors and examine systems and modalities that may help reduce the incidence of system-related errors. Data from the US FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database indicate that 6.5% of intravenous PCA-related events were due to operator error. Most (81%) of these errors were due to pump misprogramming, of which almost half were associated with patient harm; 76.4% of adverse events were attributed to device malfunction (e.g. due to frayed wires or a crack in the drug cartridge), although only 0.5% of these were associated with harm to patients. In a report based on data from MEDMARX, a voluntary database that captures reports on medication errors, 7.9% of the PCA-related errors captured over a 5-year period were described as causing harm to patients. Technological advances, such as improved PCA pump designs based on ergonomic and cognitive engineering principles, the use of barcode technology and other 'smart pump' safety features, and new postoperative pain management modalities, may play a significant role in reducing the future incidence and severity of PCA medication errors.",M3
19525843,"A comparison of three methods of pain control for posterior spinal fusions in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with morphine alone, a single preoperative intrathecal morphine injection and PCA (IT/PCA), and epidural catheter infusion without PCA (EPI) for postoperative pain control after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Postoperative pain control after PSF and SSI in AIS can be managed in different ways. EPI provides for a longer period of pain relief but is reliant on the correct placement and maintenance of the catheter in the epidural space. A single preoperative intrathecal morphine injection also provides for long acting analgesia. No direct comparison of these 3 methods of postoperative pain control has been reported. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was performed at 2 institutions from 1997 to 2005. The medical record was reviewed to determine pain scores after surgery at multiple time periods. The 3 groups were compared using Student t test and chi and significance was defined as P &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the gender, age, magnitude of curve, or number of levels fused in the IT/PCA (N = 42), PCA (N = 41), or EPI (N = 55) groups. Postoperative pain scores were lowest in the IT/PCA group in the first 8 hours (P &lt; 0.05) but the pain scores in the EPI group were then lower through 24 hours (P &lt; 0.05). Total morphine use (mg/kg) was lower in the IT/PCA group compared with the PCA group at 12 hours and 24 hours (P = 0.0001). Return to solid food ingestion was quickest in the EPI group (2.0 days) followed by the IT/PCA (2.6 days) and PCA alone (3.2 days) (P &lt; 0.002). Respiratory depression and transient neurologic change occurred most frequently in the EPI group (EPI 11/55 pts vs. 1/42 IT/PCA vs. 0/41 PCA P &lt; 0.001). Pruritus was greatest in the epidural group (11/55 P &lt; 0.05). There were no intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential changes or permanent neurologic injury recorded in any group. CONCLUSION: An EPI controls postoperative pain for the longest period of time and allows for a quicker return to consumption of solid foods. However, a single preoperative intrathecal morphine injection controls the pain equally for the first 24 hours with less pruritus and with less adverse events thus requiring less nursing and physician intervention after PSF and SSI in AIS. All methods were safe with no neurologic injury recorded.",M3
19517674,"[Comparative study of postoperative analgesia after intrathecal administration of bupivacaine with fentanyl or morphine for elective Caesarean section.]BACKGROUND: Various opioids have been recommended for spinal anaesthesia during Caesarean section. The aim of this prospective randomized, double-blind study was to compare the quality of postoperative analgesia and adverse effects after intrathecal administration of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (HB) combined with either morphine or fentanyl. METHODS: Sixty parturients were randomly allocated to receive intrathecally, 7.5-15 mg of HB with either 25 microg fentanyl (group F), or 100 microg morphine (group M). All women received 100 mg ketoprofen at 2 and 14 h after surgery, and 1.0 g paracetamol at 2, 8, 14 and 20 h after surgery. Additionally, meperidine was offered as a rescue analgesic via patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). During the first 24 h after surgery, pain intensity was evaluated using a VAS score, meperidine consumption was noted, and possible side effects were assessed. RESULTS: Mean PCA meperidine consumption was 47 mg and 130 mg, for groups M and F, respectively. Intrathecal morphine significantly prolonged the time to first PCA use, when compared to fentanyl. The mean VAS score was lower in group M. Pruritus was more frequently observed in group M. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both intrathecal morphine and fentanyl significantly reduced the intensity of postoperative pain. Morphine increased the duration of postoperative analgesia and reduced the demand for rescue meperidine.",M3

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients undergoing visceral surgery (hysterectomy, cholecystectomy) were randomly assigned to group A (three sessions of needle acupuncture, n=21), group M (3x1000 mg metamizole, n=20), or group K (control, n=25). All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) using piritramide. To adjust for nonspecific effects due to physician-patient interaction during acupuncture sessions in group A, patients in groups M and K also received three standardized visits. Primary outcome parameters were defined as pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and frequency of nausea and vomiting in a period up to the morning of the second postoperative day. RESULTS: Patients in group A reported significant less pain, nausea, and vomiting compared to patients in group K. Mean cumulative piritramide consumption was significantly lower in group A (25.0 mg) than in group M (34.5 mg) and group K (55.2 mg). CONCLUSION: Repeated needle acupuncture may be effective in postoperative pain relief and the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period. These effects seem not to be due solely to interaction between the acupuncturist and the patient.",M3

19469296,"Clinical benefits related to the combination of ketamine with morphine for patient controlled analgesia after major abdominal surgery.BACKGROUND: combination of ketamine may improve morphine patient controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) but clinical results are still equivocal. AIM: The authors designed a powerful study to evaluate this hypothesis after major abdominal surgery. METHODS: 138 patients undergoing abdominal surgery participated in the randomized double blind study. Patients were allocated to two groups: M-group: morphine 0.5 mg/ml + placebo in PCA and MK-group: morphine 0.5 mg/ml + ketamine 0.5 mg/ml with the same bolus dose and lock out time. The patients were evaluated during 48 hours by visual analog scale (VAS), simplified verbal scale (SVS). Side effects and amount of morphine used were monitored. RESULTS: The two groups are comparable for demographic data and surgery characteristics. From the 24th hour, morphine consumption was significantly lower in the MK-group. At 48 hours after surgery, the amount of morphine received in the MK-group was significantly lower than in the M-group (48 vs 66 mg, p &lt; 0.001). The average value of VAS was lower in the MK-group from the 12th hour at rest and 20th hour during mobilization. SVS was significantly lower for the MK-group after the 12th postoperative hour. The incidence of respiratory depression was higher in the M-group: 4 vs none in the MK-group. The incidence of nausea, vomiting and pruritus was halved in the MK-group (p &lt; 0.04). CONCLUSION: The combination of ketamine with morphine in PCA after major abdominal surgery offers a reduction of the morphine consumption, a reduction of pain scores and a decrease in the incidence of adverse effects.",M3
19459553,"Local anaesthetic use for the iliac crest-donor site: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations.During orthopaedic surgery of the limb, we performed a prospective, double blind controlled study on three parallel groups in 30 patients to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effect of infiltration of the iliac crest bone graft harvest site with 20 ml of bupivacaine (100 mg), ropivacaine (150 mg) or saline as control group (n = 10 in each group). Then, in a sheep model of iliac crest infiltration, we compared the pharmacokinetics of single administration of plain bupivacaine (100 mg) and bupivacaine (500 mg)-loaded microspheres. In the clinical control group, pain from the iliac crest was worse than pain from the primary surgical site. Pain from the iliac crest was significantly reduced during the first 12 postoperative hours in local anaesthetic groups compared to the control group. However, during this period, pain from the primary surgical site was increased compared to the control group. Finally, there was no difference between the three groups in the average intake of <e>PCA</e> morphine. There was no significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic difference between plain bupivacaine and ropivacaine. The maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of ropivacaine and bupivacaine were 964 (282) ng ml(-1) and 638 (366) ng ml(-1), respectively. In the sheep model, it was clearly shown that the release of bupivacaine from microspheres was controlled and prolonged despite the largest dose of bupivacaine used (500 mg; n = 4). Wound infiltration of iliac crest harvest site with local anaesthetic is an easy technique for postoperative analgesia. However, this effect lasts only 12 hours without reducing the morphine consumption due to an increase of pain from the primary surgical site. The local anaesthetic infiltration produced a significant peak of plasma level, which could be dangerous if another infiltration or regional anaesthetic technique was associated with it. Experimentally, as a drug delivery system, the use of local anaesthetic-loaded microspheres could be an interesting alternative.",M3

The main outcome measure of PCA analgesimetry is the difference in opioid requirements between the control (placebo) group and the new drug (or treatment) group. The following potential problems of PCA analgesimetry are analyzed: 1) weak correlation between pain intensity and opioid consumption, 2) interference of nonanalgesic effects of opioids, 3) role of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of opioids, 4) problems of the patient's training, 5) interaction between main outcome measures, and 6) sample size and negative outcome problems. Knowledge of the pitfalls of PCA analgesimetry should decrease the risk of errors in its use.",M3
19446688,"[Systemic analgesia for postoperative pain management in the adult]Severe postsurgical pain contributes to prolonged hospital stay and is also believed to be a risk factor for the development of chronic pain. Locoregional anesthesia, which results in faster patient recovery with fewer side effects, is favored wherever feasible, but is not applicable to every patient. Systemic analgesics are the most widely used method for providing pain relief in the postoperative period. Improvements in postoperative systemic analgesia for pain management should be applied and predictive factors for severe postoperative pain should be anticipated in order to control pain while minimizing opioid side effects. Predictive factors for severe postoperative pain include severity of preoperative pain, prior use of opiates, female gender, non-laparoscopic surgery, and surgeries involving the knee and shoulder. Pre- and intraoperative use of small doses of ketamine has a preventive effect on postoperative pain. Multimodal or balanced analgesia (the combined use of various analgesic agents) such as NSAID/morphine, NSAID/nefopam, morphine/ketamine improves analgesia with morphine-sparing effects. Nausea and vomiting, the principle side effects of morphine, can be predicted using Apfel's simplified score; patients with a high Apfel score risk should receive preemptive antiemetic agents aimed at different receptor sites, such as preoperative dexamethasone and intraoperative droperidol. Droperidol can be combined with morphine for postoperative patient-controlled anesthesia (<e>PCA</e>). When PCA is used, dosage parameters should be adjusted every day based on pain evaluation. Patients with presurgical opioid requirements will require preoperative administration of their daily opioid maintenance dose before induction of anesthesia: PCA offers useful options for effective postsurgical analgesia using a basal rate equivalent to the patient's hourly oral usage plus bolus doses as required.",M3
19440955,"Nurse-administered propofol-alfentanil sedation using a patient-controlled analgesia pump compared with opioid-benzodiazepine sedation for outpatient colonoscopy.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Nurse-administered propofol sedation (NAPS) and patient-controlled sedation using patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) pumps are gaining increasing popularity for gastrointestinal endoscopy. We compared the safety and efficacy of NAPS using PCA pumps with diazemuls-pethidine sedation (DPS) for outpatient colonoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial patients underwent outpatient colonoscopy with sedation by either NAPS or DPS. For NAPS, following intravenous loading of 0.8 mg/kg propofol, mixtures of 14.3 mg propofol and 35 microgram alfentanil were titrated by nurses using a PCA pump. For DPS, 0.1 mg/kg diazemuls and 0.5 mg/kg pethidine were given as intravenous bolus; further titration was administered as half doses at the endoscopist's discretion. Adequacy of sedation was measured by the Observer's Scale for Sedation and Alertness (OSSA) score (range 1-5). RESULTS: Between July 2005 and June 2006, 88 patients were randomly allocated to NAPS and 90 to DPS. The groups were comparable for baseline characteristics and procedure time. With NAPS, levels of sedation both during colonoscopic intubation and at reaching the cecum were significantly deeper than with DPS (OSSA 3 vs. 5, P &lt; 0.0001). There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary complication rates, pain scores, satisfaction scores, and patients' willingness to repeat colonoscopy with the same sedation. Drugs cost for NAPS was higher than for DPS (Hong Kong dollars [HKD] 98.34 vs. 5.01). CONCLUSION: Despite higher costs, nurse-administered propofol-alfentanil sedation using a PCA pump can provide deeper conscious sedation, comparable satisfaction, and similar complication risks compared with conventional opioid-benzodiazepine sedation.",M3
19419359,"Comparison of spinal anesthesia with general anesthesia on morphine requirement after abdominal hysterectomy.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare morphine consumption with patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) between spinal anesthesia (SA) (bupivacaine, morphine and fentanyl) and general anesthesia (GA) (sufentanil) after an abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: Forty women were randomly assigned to receive SA with bupivacaine 15 mg, 0.15 mg of intrathecal morphine and 15 microg of fentanyl or GA with sufentanil, both combined with PCA. The primary outcome was morphine consumption with the PCA device. The secondary outcomes were post-operative pain at rest and under stress on a visual analog scale, nausea, pruritus and respiratory depression on a standardized scale. Outcome measures were recorded at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 h post-anesthesia. The duration of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: Patients in the SA group consumed at least two times less morphine at each time interval than the GA group: at 48 h, they used 19 +/- 17 vs. 81 +/- 31 mg (P&lt;0.0001). Post-operative pain at rest was lower in the SA group until the 18th hour and under stress until the 48th. There was more sedation in the GA group until the 18th hour. Little difference was observed in the incidence of pruritus. Nausea was more intense at the 6th hour in the GA group. There was no difference in the respiratory rate. The duration of PACU stay was shorter for the SA group (52 +/- 9 vs. 73 +/- 11 min, P&lt;0.0001) as was the duration of hospital stay (2.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.7 days, P=0.01).

METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial included women undergoing laparotomy for a gynecologic disorder. Patients were randomized to postoperative IV morphine PCA (control arm) or to postoperative morphine-bupivacaine PCEA (treatment arm). Postoperative outcomes such as pain, and length of hospital stay were compared with an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain at rest and when coughing--assessed by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: Between 9/04 and 6/07, 153 patients were randomized and 135 were evaluable (PCEA=67; PCA=68). Over 75% of the women in this study had gynecologic cancer. Patients in the PCEA arm had significantly less postoperative pain at rest on Day 1 and during the first 3 postoperative days when coughing compared to the PCA arm (P&lt;0.05). The mean pain score at rest on Day 1 was 3.3 for the PCEA group compared to 4.3 for the PCA group (P=0.01). Overall, postoperative pain at rest and while coughing in the first 6 days was less in women treated with PCEA compared to PCA (P&lt;0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PCEA offers superior postoperative pain control after laparotomy for gynecologic surgery compared to traditional IV PCA. Women requiring major open surgery for gynecologic cancer should be offered PCEA for postoperative pain management if there are no contraindications.",M3
19364000,"[Combined intrathecal morphine and bupivacaine for elective post-caesarean pain]BACKGROUND: Intrathecal morphine is widely used for analgesia following cesarean section in Europe and North America. In Japan analgesic method of intrathecal morphine was admitted to the insurance adjustment and it is necessary to study optimal dose of the morphine. METHODS: We examined 72 parturients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive, in a double-blind fashion, either morphine 0.05 mg, morphine 0.1 mg, morphine 0.2 mg, or saline in 0.1 ml (control group) mixed with the bupivacaine for cesarean section. A patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) device for intravenous morphine provided free access to additional analgesics for 24 hr. RESULTS: Total amount of morphine during postoperative first 24 hrs using PCA was significantly higher in the control group than in 0.1 and 0.2 mg groups. There were no significant differences between the control group and the morphine groups with respect to nausea. The incidence of pruritus was significantly higher in 0.1 and 0.2 mg groups than in the control group. In one patient in 0.2 mg group, oxygen saturation decreased below 95% postoperatively, but it was improved by oxygen inhalation. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that intrathecal morphine 0.1 mg gives effective analgesia with minimum side effects after cesarean section for the Japanese patients.",M3
19361945,"[Acute respiratory distress subordinate to a morphine overdose during a frail elderly patient controlled analgesia]We describe a case-report of an 85-year-male patient with a patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) after a total hip arthroplasty. Four hours after surgery, acute respiratory distress secondary to a morphine overdose occurred, requiring an antagonisation with naloxone. Morphine overdose during a PCA was always caused by a wrong use of the pump. In this case-report, no mistake of programming or administration's use was found. Too important morphine's doses managed in comparison with the patient's age and his renal failure could explain this morphine's accumulation and the respiratory distress. This observation reminds us the obligation to determine the optimal posology in accordance with the rate of glomerular filtration estimated by Cockcroft and Gault formula for patients using a PCA.",M3
19337241,"Remifentanil vs. meperidine for patient-controlled analgesia during colonoscopy: a randomized double-blind trial.OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction in terms of efficacy and safety of remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) during colonoscopy with that of a combination of midazolam and meperidine. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomly assigned to two groups. All of the patients received midazolam 0.03 mg/kg intravenously for premedication. In the remifentanil group, a bolus dose of remifentanil was given, and a patient-controlled sedation analgesia (PCSA) pump was set to inject further bolus doses with no  lockout  time. Patients in the meperidine group received a bolus of meperidine and sham PCSA. Non-invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry were monitored throughout the study. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (OAA/S) was performed at baseline, every 5 min during, and after colonoscopy. Assessment of pain and satisfaction with sedoanalgesia was scheduled after colonoscopy and 24-72 h later by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). The technical difficulty of the examination and the gastroenterologist's satisfaction were assessed similarly. RESULTS: The degree of pain, the level of satisfaction with sedoanalgesia by patients and gastroenterologists, and the degree of difficulty experienced by the endoscopist were not different in the two groups. The time to reach an Aldrete score &gt; or = 9 was significantly shorter in the remifentanil group (P &lt; 0.0001); discharge times did not differ between the groups (P = 0.36). There was no difference between the groups regarding the duration of colonoscopy (P = 0.82) and the stability of vital signs. At the end of the procedure, OAA/S was significantly higher in the remifentanil group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil PCA is safe and effective to induce sedoanalgesia during colonoscopy. Further studies should address the optimization of dosing and lock out setting.",M3
19326422,"Intrathecal morphine combined with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia is an effective and safe method for immediate postoperative pain control in live liver donors.The healthy condition of living donors makes their tolerance to pain particularly low, and clinicians are often challenged to come up with an analgesic technique that is effective yet ensures donor safety. This study compared, in donor right hepatectomy, the efficacy and safety of preoperative intrathecal morphine (ITM) combined with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-<e>PCA</e>) with IV-PCA alone. Forty adult patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups: ITM+IV-PCA group (n = 20) and IV-PCA-only group (n = 20). Patients in the ITM+IV-PCA group received morphine sulfate (400 microg). The visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and when coughing and supplementary meperidine and IV-PCA (fentanyl) consumption were assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 56, 64, and 72 hours after surgery. Also, side effects such as sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and respiratory depression were evaluated. The ITM+IV-PCA group showed significantly less pain at rest and when coughing for up to 30 hours and 24 hours, respectively. Cumulative postoperative consumption of meperidine and IV-PCA (fentanyl) were significantly less in the ITM+IV-PCA group. The incidence of side effects were comparable between the 2 groups except for pruritus; its incidence was significantly higher in the ITM+IV-PCA group during the first 24 hours, but no treatment was required due to its mild severity. The results of our study suggest that preoperative ITM combined with IV-PCA may be considered as an effective and safe pain management regimen in living liver donors who have characteristics of low tolerance to pain and postoperative coagulation derangement.",M3
19318296,"Comparison of the effect of epidural and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia on bowel activity after cesarean section: a retrospective study of 726 Chinese patients.BACKGROUND: Epidural patient-controlled analgesia (EPCA) and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) have been used widely in parturients after cesarean section. Although many studies have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of both EPCA and IVPCA, their effects on bowel activity of patients who have undergone cesarean section delivery have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of EPCA and IVPCA on bowel activity after cesarean section. METHODS: We collected data from 726 parturients who consented to receive either EPCA or IVPCA for postoperative analgesia following cesarean section delivery. All patients used postoperative <e>PCA</e> for at least 2 days. The analgesic solution for EPCA was 0.05% bupivacaine plus fentanyl (3 microg/mL), and that for IVPCA was 0.1% morphine. The patients were assessed by visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores at rest and in a dynamic state, time to first flatus passage after the surgery, and overall satisfaction after completion of the PCA course. Student's t test was used to determine intergroup differences. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the EPCA and IVPCA groups in the time to first flatus passage, overall satisfaction and VAS scores at rest and in a dynamic state. Patients in the EPCA group had a shorter time to first flatus passage, higher overall satisfaction and lower VAS scores. In addition, regional anesthesia offered an apparently shorter time to first flatus passage in comparison with general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: PCA is safe and effective in alleviating postoperative pain following cesarean section. EPCA offers a faster return of bowel activity, lower VAS scores, and better patient satisfaction than IVPCA.",M3
19299145,"Efficacy of intra-articular cocktail analgesic injection in total knee arthroplasty - a randomized controlled trial.In a randomized, double-blind, placebo, parallel and controlled study, 80 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent unilateral TKA were randomly assigned to two groups: Trial Group, where patients received intra-articular intraoperative injection containing morphine, bupivacaine and betamethasone, and Control Group, where patients received normal saline as control. All patients received patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) for 48 h postoperatively. We found that intra-articular cocktail analgesic injection significantly reduced the morphine consumption during the 0-36 h postoperative period and the total morphine consumption. VAS at rest in Trial Group at postoperative 6, 10, 24 and 36 h was significantly lower than that in Control Group, and VAS during activity in Trial Group at postoperative 24 h and 36 h was significantly lower than that in Control Group. The time of ability to perform an active straight leg raise and to actively reach 90 degrees knee flexion, as well as ROM of the knee at the 15th postoperative day, was better in Trial Group than those in Control Group. There were no significant differences in postoperative wound healing, infection, blood pressure, heart rate, rash, respiratory depression, urine retention and DVT between the two groups. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting in Trial Group was lower than that of Control Group. This study revealed that intra-articular cocktail analgesic injection reduced the need for morphine and offered a better pain control, without apparent risks following TKA.",M3
19262363,"Intravenous versus epidural analgesia after surgical repair of pectus excavatum.Surgical repair of pectus excavatum can be associated with significant postoperative pain. Various analgesic modalities have been suggested including thoracic epidural analgesia and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV <e>PCA</e>). The current study compares the efficacy and adverse efficacy profile of these 2 analgesic modalities. The charts of 18 adolescents who had undergone pectus excavatum repair were retrospectively reviewed and divided into 2 groups: thoracic epidural analgesia (E) or IV PCA (I). Demographic data included age, weight, sex, and anesthesia/surgical times. Treatment days (defined as the number of days the patients received intravenous or epidural analgesia), time to oral intake, and time to discharge from the hospital were also recorded. Pain scores using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) and sedation scores were recorded in the postanesthesia care unit and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours postoperatively. The charts were also reviewed for side effects including nausea and/or vomiting, pruritus, oxygen desaturation, and respiratory depression. The study cohort included 18 patients divided equally into group E (epidural analgesia) (n = 9) and group I (IV PCA). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to demographic data, time to oral intake, and time to hospital discharge. Anesthesia to surgery times were longer in group E compared with group I (43 +/- 11 versus 25 +/- 11 minutes, P = 0.004), but there was no difference in overall surgery and anesthesia times. The number of treatment days (days that the patients received intravenous or epidural medications) was decreased in group E versus group I (2.3 +/- 0.7 versus 3.3 +/- 1.0 days, P = 0.027). There was no difference between the 2 groups in regard to the onset of oral intake or hospital discharge time. Pain scores were initially higher in the postanesthesia care unit in group E versus group I (6.78 +/- 2.17 versus 5.78 +/- 3.77); however, after that point, pain scores were lower in group E than in group I. There was no difference between the 2 groups in regard to sedation scores or adverse effect profile. Epidural analgesia provided better pain control than the intravenous route for the management of patients after pectus excavatum repair. No adverse effects related to epidural analgesia were noted. The only issue identified with thoracic epidural anesthesia was a mean increase of 18 minutes for anesthesia time required for catheter placement before the start of the case.",M3
19214642,"Multimodal pain management after total hip and knee arthroplasty at the Ranawat Orthopaedic Center.Improvements in pain management techniques in the last decade have had a major impact on the practice of total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA). Although there are a number of treatment options for postoperative pain, a gold standard has not been established. However, there appears to be a shift towards multimodal approaches using regional anesthesia to minimize narcotic consumption and to avoid narcotic-related side effects. Over the last 10 years, we have used intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>), femoral nerve block (FNB), and continuous epidural infusions for 24 and 48 hours with and without FNB. Unfortunately, all of these techniques had shortcomings, not the least of which was suboptimal pain control and unwanted side effects. Our practice has currently evolved to using a multimodal protocol that emphasizes local periarticular injections while minimizing the use of parenteral narcotics. Multimodal protocols after THA and TKA have been a substantial advance; they provide better pain control and patient satisfaction, lower overall narcotic consumption, reduce hospital stay, and improve function while minimizing complications. Although no pain protocol is ideal, it is clear that patients should have optimum pain control after TKA and THA for enhanced satisfaction and function. Level of Evidence: Level V, expert opinion.

19249923,"Efficacy of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia after supratentorial intracranial surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial. Clinical article.OBJECT: Opioid administration following major intracranial surgery is often limited by a presumed lack of need and a concern that opioids will adversely affect postoperative outcome and interfere with the neurological examination. Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating that these patients suffer moderate to severe postoperative pain and that this pain is often undertreated. The authors hypothesized that intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) would safely and more effectively treat postoperative supratentorial craniotomy pain than conventional as needed (PRN) therapy. METHODS: Following a standardized course of general anesthesia, adult patients who underwent elective supratentorial intracranial surgery were randomized in the neurosciences intensive care unit to receive either PRN intravenous fentanyl 25-50 microg every 30 minutes or PCA intravenous fentanyl 0.5 microg/kg every 15 minutes (maximum 4 doses/hour). The authors measured pain (self-reported scale score [0-10]), sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale score), Glasgow Coma Scale score, fentanyl use, and major adverse events (excessive sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea, or vomiting) hourly. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with a mean age of 48 years (range 22-77 years) were randomized to intravenous PCA (29 patients) or PRN fentanyl (35 patients) groups. There were no statistically significant demographic differences between the 2 groups. Patients receiving intravenous PCA had significantly lower pain scores than those receiving intravenous PRN fentanyl (2.53 +/- 1.96 vs 3.62 +/- 2.11 [p = 0.039]) and received significantly more fentanyl than the PRN group (44.1 +/- 34.5 vs 23.6 +/- 23.7 microg/hour [p = 0.007]). There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding the number of patients with adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous PCA more effectively treats the pain of supratentorial intracranial surgery than PRN fentanyl, and patients in the former group did not experience any untoward events related to the self-administration of opioids.",M3
19122548,"Continuous infusion of butorphanol combined with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia after total abdominal hysterectomy: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Postoperative pain therapy is still a problem for clinicians. Continuous basal infusion of drugs combined with standard patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) is considered to be an effective means of postoperative acute pain management. This study was designed to investigate the analgesic efficacy, morphine-sparing effects and side effects of butorphanol delivered as a continuous infusion adjunct to intravenous morphine PCA after abdominal hysterectomy. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-six ASA physical status I-II patients, undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy, were allocated to this randomized double-blind controlled study and assigned to one of two groups. In the butorphanol (n = 96) group, patients received an intravenous loading dose of 10 microg kg(-1) butorphanol followed by infusion of 2 microg kg(-1) h(-1) butorphanol combined with intravenous PCA set at a bolus of 0.02 mg kg(-1) morphine after surgery. The control group (n = 90) received a physiological saline infusion combined with the same morphine PCA. Pain intensity on movement and at rest, sedation, satisfaction with analgesia, morphine consumption and side effects were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients completed the study. The butorphanol group had analgesia superior to the physiological saline control (P &lt; 0.001). The butorphanol infusion group produced higher sedation ratings (P &lt; 0.001) and better satisfaction (P &lt; 0.05) and a lower incidence of side effects (P &lt; 0.001) with the exception of sweating and dry mouth (P &lt; 0.05) than the physiological saline group. The butorphanol group consumed less morphine over 48 h, 24.6 mg (95% confidence interval, 18.7-46.6), than the physiological saline group, 58.5 mg (95% confidence interval, 41.5-79.2; P = 0.006). There were no differences between urinary catheterization of more than 24 h, first time out of bed and time to discharge to home. CONCLUSION: Basal infusion of butorphanol combined with intravenous morphine PCA in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy shows effective analgesia with sedation and fewer side effects.",M3
19192974,"Fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system versus morphine IV-<e>PCA</e> for postoperative pain management: survey of healthcare provider opinion.OBJECTIVE: This survey estimated differences in staff time requirements between fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system (fentanyl ITS) and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) in post-operative pain management. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: European Delphi panels of nurses and anaesthesiologists, who had practical experience with both fentanyl ITS and IV-PCA, were provided a task list, developed from a previous clinical trial, associated with each modality. The panellists were asked to estimate time spent on each task. Estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated patient proportion for whom the task was performed by the expected frequency of task performance, by the estimated task time. RESULTS: Data is presented as mean minutes (standard deviation). Fentanyl ITS use was estimated to save an average of 68.7 min total staff time per patient per treatment period compared to IV-PCA (86.5 (20.3)) vs. 156.4 (55.2); respectively; p &lt; 0.001), the largest amount of savings being in the 'Setup' category (19.4 (6.7) vs. 47.8 (17.5), respectively; p &lt; 0.001), and mostly due to IV-PCA task elimination. Significant time savings were estimated using fentanyl ITS over IV-PCA in the 'Discontinuation' category (4.8 (2.4) vs. 20.6 (3.3), respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Panellists agreed that fentanyl ITS use would decrease staff assistance time required for helping patients during self-care routines and it may also decrease the patient's time to ambulation. Survey limitations included: possible recall bias due to the observational nature of the data; task list descriptions resulting in possible double-counting of data; no sensitivity analyses; and the declarative nature of the responses possibly leading to a dilution of survey findings. CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl ITS use was estimated, by expert opinion, to require 44% less staff time than IV-PCA use.",M3
19104182,"Comparison of continuous infusion versus automated bolus for postoperative patient-controlled analgesia with popliteal sciatic nerve catheters.BACKGROUND: This investigation was designed to compare a new methodology of automated regular bolus with a continuous infusion of local anesthetic for continuous popliteal sciatic block; both regimens were combined with patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing hallux valgus repair were randomly allocated to receive an infusion of 0.125% levobupivacaine administered through a popliteal catheter as an automated regular bolus (n = 25) or as a continuous infusion (n = 25), both combined with PCA. Postoperative pain scores, incremental doses delivered by the PCA, local anesthetic consumed per hour, and the need for rescue tramadol analgesia were recorded. RESULTS: Both dosing regimens provided similar postoperative analgesia. Consumption of local anesthetic (5.14 ml/h, 5-5.75 ml/h) and dose request from the PCA (1, 0-5.4) was lower in the automated bolus group as compared to the continuous infusion group (5.9 ml/h, 5.05-7.8 ml/h; doses by PCA: 6.5, 0-20.5; P &lt; 0.05). The need for rescue tramadol was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In continuous popliteal sciatic block, local anesthetic administered as an automated regular bolus in conjunction with PCA provided similar pain relief as a continuous infusion technique combined with PCA; however, the new dosing regimen reduced the need for additional PCA and the overall consumption of local anesthetic.",M3
19111995,"Predicting the effectiveness of virtual reality relaxation on pain and anxiety when added to <e>PCA</e> morphine in patients having burns dressings changes.BACKGROUND: Pain arising in burns sufferers is often severe and protracted. The prospect of a dressing change can heighten existing pain by impacting both physically and psychologically. In this trial we examined whether pre-procedural virtual reality guided relaxation added to patient controlled analgesia with morphine reduced pain severity during awake dressings changes in burns patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in all patients with burns necessitating admission to a tertiary burns referral centre. Eligible patients requiring awake dressings changes were randomly allocated to single use virtual reality relaxation plus intravenous morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion or to intravenous morphine patient controlled analgesia infusion alone. Patients rated their worst pain intensity during the dressing change using a visual analogue scale. The primary outcome measure was presence of 30% or greater difference in pain intensity ratings between the groups in estimation of worst pain during the dressing change. FINDINGS: Of 88 eligible and consenting patients having awake dressings changes, 43 were assigned to virtual reality relaxation plus intravenous morphine PCA infusion and 43 to morphine PCA infusion alone. The group receiving virtual reality relaxation plus morphine PCA infusion reported significantly higher pain intensities during the dressing change (mean=7.3) compared with patients receiving morphine PCA alone (mean=5.3) (p=0.003) (95% CI 0.6-2.8). INTERPRETATION: The addition of virtual reality guided relaxation to morphine PCA infusion in burns patients resulted in a significant increase in pain experienced during awake dressings changes. In the absence of a validated predictor for responsiveness to virtual reality relaxation such a therapy cannot be recommended for general use in burns patients having awake dressings changes.",M3
19084439,"Effect of somatostatin analogue octreotide on pain relief after major abdominal surgery.BACKGROUND: Octreotide acetate is an 8-amino-acids synthetic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin with much-enhanced duration of action and lower incidence of side effects. We assessed the utility of using intravenous octreotide as an adjuvant to opioid analgesia that might exert a post-operative opioid-sparing effect. METHODS: Forty-four patients were randomly allocated, to receive either a placebo or intraoperative octreotide 0.33 microg kg(-1)h(-1) intravenous infusion that was maintained in the post-operative period. Patients received for post-operative analgesia an intravenous piritramide patient controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>), set to deliver a piritramide 0.02 mgkg(-1) dose. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA revealed significantly fewer (P=0.0003) mean+/-SD weighted piritramide dose requirements in the octreotide group (19.5+/-6.3 microg kg(-1)h(-1)) than in the control group (35.7+/-8.2 microg kg(-1)h(-1)). Dunnett's two-sided multiple-comparison post hoc test revealed a significant difference between the two groups during the first 22 post-operative hours, following which there were no differences between the two groups. There were no significant differences over time in the mean arterial pressure (P=0.722), heart rate (P=0.579) and respiratory rate (P=0.823) between the octreotide group (80+/-10mm Hg, 74+/-12, 14+/-2) and the control group (82+/-9 mm Hg, 76+/-11, 15+/-3), respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that perioperative octreotide intravenous infusion could be an adjuvant to opioid analgesia as it exerted a piritramide opioid-sparing effect. We encountered more systemic side effects such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea in the octreotide group than in the control group. Our findings could be beneficial to patients who cannot tolerate the adverse effects of opioids.",M3
19100932,"Patient-controlled analgesia combined with either ondansetron or ondansetron plus prochlorperazine for control of pain and nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare ondansetron with ondansetron plus prochlorperazine, added to a patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) solution for control of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: 150 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients undergoing abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given a PCA morphine solution containing either 30 mg of ondansetron (Group O), 30 mg of ondansetron plus 20 mg of prochlorperazine (Group OP), or no antiemetic (Group C; control group). MEASUREMENTS: Demographic data were recorded, along with anesthetic and surgical time, total fluid intake, frequency of Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU) PONV, discharge time and length of stay, frequency of PONV while on the hospital floor, highest nausea scores, total PCA morphine use, and PCA utilization times. MAIN RESULTS: Demographic and intraoperative variables were similar in all groups. In the first 24 hours after surgery, nausea was higher in Group C than Group OP. Emesis in Group C was twice that of either Group O or Group OP. No differences were noted between groups in PACU PONV. Patients receiving ondansetron plus prochlorperazine when on the hospital floor had a lower frequency of nausea, while patients receiving ondansetron alone had a lower frequency of vomiting than did the control group. The adjusted odds of vomiting doubled for every 12 hours for Group C patients when receiving PCA.

19083025,"[Circadian rhythm of <e>PCA</e>-based opioid consumption in children with chemotherapy-related mucositis]BACKGROUND: In order to match the interindividual and intraindividual differences in opioid requirements of pediatric oncology patients with mucositis, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) seems to be the optimal pain therapy option, but scientific data are lacking. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of PCA-treated children with mucositis was carried out over a 6-year period (2000-2006) at the university hospital for children in Erlangen. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 12.6 years and they mainly suffered from forms of acute leukemia. Daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) requirements increased with the start of the PCA therapy from 14.5 mg/day to 18.7 mg/day (p=0.021; Wilcoxon test). Children required more opioids by bolus request during the night (10:01 p.m. to 06:00 a.m.; 6.28 mg; 13%) than during the other 8-hour intervals (06:01 a.m. to 02:00 p.m. and 02:01 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.; both 21.3 mg (43.5%) during the whole 10-day study period. In 8 out of 10 days there was a significant diurnal variation in opioid requirement with significantly lower requirement during the night (p&lt;0.05 Friedman test). The median count of delivered and un-delivered bolus requests during the night was 0-1 and 0, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCA seems to be an ideal, dependable and feasible mode of analgesic administration for the individual titration of dose in children with chemotherapy-induced mucositis. This is expressed through the increase in daily self-administered opioid doses after starting PCA, the huge interindividual variability in opioid consumption and the rare event of an un-delivered bolus request during lock-out time. With the use of a background infusion, additional bolus requests are rare during the night.",M3
19016572,"Analgo-sedation of patients with burns outside the operating room.Following the initial resuscitation of burn patients, the pain experienced may be divided into a 'background' pain and a 'breakthrough' pain associated with painful procedures. While background pain may be treated with intravenous opioids via continuous infusion or patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) and/or less potent oral opioids, breakthrough pain may be treated with a variety of interventions. The aim is to reduce patient anxiety, improve analgesia and ensure immobilization when required. Untreated pain and improper sedation may result in psychological distress such as post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression or delirium. This review summarizes recent developments and current techniques in sedation and analgesia in non-intubated adult burn patients during painful procedures performed outside the operating room (e.g. staple removal, wound-dressing, bathing). Current techniques of sedation and analgesia include different approaches, from a slight increase in background pain therapy (e.g. morphine PCA) to PCA with rapid-onset opioids, to multimodal drug combinations, nitrous oxide, regional blocks, or non-pharmacological approaches such as hypnosis and virtual reality. The most reliable way to administer drugs is intravenously. Fast-acting opioids can be combined with ketamine, propofol or benzodiazepines. Adjuvant drugs such as clonidine or NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have also been used. Patients receiving ketamine will usually maintain spontaneous breathing. This is an important feature in patients who are continuously turned during wound dressing procedures and where analgo-sedation is often performed by practitioners who are not specialists in anaesthesiology. Drugs are given in small boluses or by patient-controlled sedation, which is titrated to effect, according to sedation and pain scales. Patient-controlled infusion with propofol has also been used. However, we must bear in mind that burn patients often show an altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response to drugs as a result of altered haemodynamics, protein binding and/or increased extracellular fluid volume, and possible changes in glomerular filtration. Because sedation and analgesia can range from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) to general anaesthesia, sedative and analgesic agents should always be administered by designated trained practitioners and not by the person performing the procedure. At least one individual who is capable of establishing a patent airway and positive pressure ventilation, as well as someone who can call for additional assistance, should always be present whenever analgo-sedation is administered. Oxygen should be routinely delivered during sedation. Blood pressure and continuous ECG monitoring should be carried out whenever possible, even if a patient is undergoing bathing or other procedures that may limit monitoring of vital pulse-oximetry parameters.",M3

18997527,"Recent advances in patient-controlled sedation.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in minimally invasive procedures have resulted in an increased demand for procedural sedation. Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) has been in clinical use for almost 20 years, but has not been reviewed in over 10 years. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances in microprocessor technology, increased demand for procedural sedation in a cost-conscious environment, and the availability of readily titratable pharmacologic agents together stimulated the development of alternative sedation practices. Continued research into the neurobiology of pain perception and the placebo effect has also played a role. PCS and patient-maintained sedation, primarily with propofol, have emerged as intriguing clinical alternatives to traditional sedation based in part on extensions of traditional <e>PCA</e> models. SUMMARY: PCS has been applied to a wide variety of procedures, but systems that can be applied 'off-the-shelf' are not easy to tune. New approaches to PCS may address these limitations. Better understanding of the psychology of sedation may lead to better patient acceptance of PCS.",M3
18976162,"Postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia in thyroid surgery: comparison of fentanyl and ondansetron regimens with and without the nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drug ketorolac.BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), through synergistic action with opioids, can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). We compared the efficacy of three PCA regimens. METHODS: Patients (n = 135) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly allocated to three PCA regimens. All groups received 12 mg ondansetron (a serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist). In addition, Group I received the opioid fentanyl, 15 microg/kg. Group II received fentanyl 12.5 microg/kg and the NSAID ketorolac, 1.5 mg/kg, and Group III received fentanyl 10 microg/kg and ketorolac 3 mg/kg. Pain scores, nausea and vomiting, and dizziness were assessed 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: Pain scores were similar among the three groups. However, postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in groups II and III (p &lt; 0.05) than group I. Postoperative dizziness was significantly lower in group III than groups I and II (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The NSAID ketorolac when combined with lower doses of the opioid fentanyl and the same dose of ondansetron is associated with the same analgesic efficacy but less nausea and vomiting after thyroid surgery. A higher ratio of NSAID to opioid, when used as reported here, is associated with less postoperative dizziness.",M3
18987053,"Effect of combining dexmedetomidine and morphine for intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.BACKGROUND: Perioperative use of dexmedetomidine is associated with reduction in postoperative analgesic requirements. This study examined whether dexmedetomidine added to i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) morphine could improve analgesia while reducing opioid-related side-effects. METHODS: In this double-blinded, randomized, controlled study, 100 women undergoing abdominal total hysterectomy were allocated to receive either morphine 1 mg ml(-1) alone (Group M) or morphine 1 mg ml(-1) plus dexmedetomidine 5 microg ml(-1) (Group D) for postoperative i.v. PCA, which was programmed to deliver 1 ml per demand with a 5 min lockout interval and no background infusion. Cumulative PCA requirements, pain intensities, cardiovascular and respiratory variables, and PCA-related adverse events were recorded for 24 h after operation. RESULTS: Compared with Group M, patients in Group D required 29% less morphine during the 0-24 h postoperative period and reported significantly lower pain levels from the second postoperative hour onwards and throughout the study. Whereas levels of sedation were similar between the groups at each observational time point, decreases in heart rate and mean blood pressure from presurgery baseline at 1, 2, and 4 h after operation were significantly greater in Group D (by a range of 5-7 beats min(-1) and 10-13%, respectively). The 4-24 h incidence of nausea was significantly lower in Group D (34% vs 56.3%, P&lt;0.05). There was no bradycardia, hypotension, oversedation, or respiratory depression. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of dexmedetomidine to i.v. PCA morphine resulted in superior analgesia, significant morphine sparing, less morphine-induced nausea, and was devoid of additional sedation and untoward haemodynamic changes.",M3
18930428,"[Postoperative analgesia with continuous intra-articular infusion of ropivacaine following trapeziectomy]OBJECTIVES: A pilot study was implemented to evaluate the efficacy of patient controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with continuous intra-articular infusion of ropivacaine following trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition. METHODS: Twelve patients were prospectively included. A catheter was placed into the trapezium void and connected to a PCA pump set on a continuous intra-articular infusion rate of ropivacaine: 2mg/ml. Patients were allowed to deliver additional boluses when analgesia was incomplete. RESULTS: Pain was evaluated less than 3/10 (Numeric Scale Evaluation) by 92% of the patients during the first 48 h. No toxicity of the local anaesthetic nor catheter-related complication were reported. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study showed continuous basal and bolus infusion of ropivacaine through a single catheter placed into the trapezium void to provide an excellent postoperative pain control and to be related to a high patient's satisfaction level.",M3
18945716,"Effectiveness and safety of postoperative pain management: a survey of 18 925 consecutive patients between 1998 and 2006 (2nd revision): a database analysis of prospectively raised data.BACKGROUND: Approximately 30-80% of postoperative patients complain about moderate to severe post-surgical pain, indicating that postoperative pain treatment is still a problem. METHODS: We analysed prospectively collected data on patients in a university hospital receiving systemic and epidural patient-controlled analgesia and continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) documented by the acute pain service team in a computer-based system. RESULTS: Of 18 925 patients visited in the postoperative period between 1998 and 2006, 14 223 patients received patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), 1591 i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (IV-<e>PCA</e>), 1737 continuous brachial plexus block, and 1374 continuous femoral/sciatic nerve block. Mean dynamic and resting pain scores (VAS 0-100) were significantly lower for peripheral or neuroaxial regional analgesia compared with patient-controlled systemic opioid analgesia (P&lt;0.05). The risk of a symptomatic spinal mass lesion including epidural haematoma (0.02%; 1:4741) or epidural abscess (0.014%; 1:7142) after PCEA was 1:2857 (0.04%). Neurological complications after CPNB occurred in two patients who received interscalene brachial plexus block. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PCEA, IV-PCA, and CPNB are safe and efficient. Although all of these treatment strategies provide effective analgesia, PCEA and CPNB provided superior pain relief compared with IV-PCA. We demonstrated that serious complications of analgesic techniques are rare but possibly disastrous necessitating a close supervision by an acute pain service. We found a low rate of adverse effects including hypotension and motor impairment and a low incidence of epidural haematoma for thoracic PCEA compared with lumbar PCEA.",M3
18806056,"The side effects of morphine and hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia.BACKGROUND: Despite  clinical lore  among health care providers that treatment with hydromorphone results in improved pain control and fewer adverse side effects, morphine continues to be the first-line medication for postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). In this study, we compared the efficacy and side-effect profiles of morphine and hydromorphone at concentrations producing equivalent drug effect measured by pain score and miosis. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 50 general and gynecological surgery patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either morphine (1 mg/mL) or hydromorphone (0.2 mg/mL) via PCA after surgery and were followed for a period of 8 h. The primary outcome was nausea. Secondary outcome variables were pruritus, vomiting, sedation, pain report, pupillary miosis, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The side effect profile was not different between drugs. The incidence of nausea did not differ between morphine and hydromorphone-treated patients (1 h: 44% vs 52%, 8 h: 68% vs 64%), vomiting (1 h: 4% vs 0%, 8 h: 0% vs 4%), or pruritus (1 h: 4% vs 16%, 8 h: 40% vs 40%). There was no difference in the amount of medication required to treat side effects or patient satisfaction. The average ratio of morphine to hydromorphone use was about 7:1. The patients used 10.9+/-6.0 mg morphine versus 1.57+/-1.0 mg hydromorphone after 1 h and 29.0+/-18.0 mg morphine versus 3.9+/-2.5 mg hydromorphone after 8 h. There was no difference between the morphine and hydromorphone groups with respect to postoperative pain scores with movement at 1 h (7.9+/-2.3 vs 7.1+/-2.4) or 8 h (5.7+/-2.8 vs 5.9+/-2.7). There was also no difference in pain at rest or miosis between groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no systematic difference between morphine and hydromorphone in opioid-related side effects. Neither was there any difference in efficacy of pain control or patient satisfaction when patients self-titrated to equal drug effect as measured by equianalgesia and pupillary miosis. The choice between morphine and hydromorphone for use in PCA should be guided by patient history, as there may be idiosyncratic reactions to either drug.",M3
18834819,"The efficacy of intravenous patient-controlled remifentanil versus morphine anesthesia after coronary artery surgery.OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of remifentanil and morphine after coronary artery surgery in a patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) protocol. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study. SETTING: Single institution, university hospital. PARTICIPANT: Sixty cardiac surgical patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. INTERVENTIONS: After the operation, patients were allocated to 1 of 2 groups. In the first group (group R, n = 30), the following intravenous PCA protocol was programmed: remifentanil infusion, 0.05 microg/kg/min; bolus, 0.25 microg/kg; and lockout time, 5 minutes. In the second group (group M, n = 30), the intravenous PCA protocol was as follows: morphine infusion, 0.3 mg/h; bolus, 1 mg; and lockout time, 5 minutes. In addition to intravenous opioids, paracetamol was administered during the study. In both groups, tramadol was added to the regimen after PCA had been terminated at 24 hours after surgery. In addition to tramadol and paracetamol, 10 mg of morphine sulfate was administered if the numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain was 3 or more after the first postoperative day. Pain was assessed with an NRS in each patient at rest, while coughing, and during movement for 72 hours. Sedation levels were measured with the Ramsay sedation scale. Overall effectiveness of pain relief was evaluated with a 4-stage scale ( very good,   good,   moderate,  or  bad ). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During coughing, the NRS values were statistically significantly lower in group R than they were in group M at 12 and 24 hours after surgery (median 1 vs 3 at 12 hours and 2 v 3.5 at 24 hours) (p &lt; 0.05). On movement, NRS values were statistically significantly lower in group R than they were in group M at 12 hours after surgery (median 1 v 2.5) (p &lt; 0.05). After the first 24 hours, the requirement for additional analgesia was similar in both groups. The overall effectiveness of pain relief was rated  very good  or  good ' in 87% of patients in group R and in 72% of patients in group M (p &gt; .05). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in patient satisfaction between the 2 groups. On the basis of the reduction of pain scores (with cough and movement) at 1 or 2 postoperative time points, PCA-remifentanil infusion is a better analgesic technique; overall, both PCA techniques provided for effective pain scores (&lt;3). In patients in whom PCA morphine is contraindicated after CABG surgery, PCA remifentanil is a safe alternative.",M3
18758200,"Patient-controlled analgesia versus oral controlled-release oxycodone - are they interchangeable for acute postoperative pain after laparoscopic colorectal surgeries?BACKGROUND: Standard therapy for postoperative pain after laparoscopic colorectal surgeries at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital consists of intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) for the first 24-48 h, followed by oral analgesics. We compared the efficacy and safety of oral controlled-release (CR) oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin tablets) and PCA after laparoscopic colorectal surgeries. METHODS: Between March and August 2006 (phase 1 study), 14 patients underwent laparoscopic colectomy, laparoscopic hemicolectomy or laparoscopic-assisted anterior resections. All patients were on oral CR oxycodone with oral immediate-release oxycodone on an as-needed basis for breakthrough pain. Pain intensity, analgesic use, length of hospital stay and side effects were evaluated. These were compared to data obtained from a second study of a similar design where 9 patients underwent similar operations from October 2006 to July 2007 (phase 2 study) and were on PCA morphine. RESULTS: All patients in the CR oxycodone and PCA morphine groups needed the opioid medication for only 2 days. There was no difference in mean (range) postoperative pain intensity scores between patients on oxycodone and those on PCA morphine for the 1st postoperative day [2.07 (0-5) vs. 2.78 (2-4) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10; p = 0.10] and the 2nd postoperative day [1.14 (0-2) vs. 1.67 (0-3); p = 0.10]. Generalized estimating equations with linear link function confirmed that there was a significant relief of pain in patients after operation. On average, the VAS score of pain was 1.00 units lower on day 2 when compared with day 1 (p &lt; 0.01). The mean (range) doses of oxycodone used on the 1st and 2nd postoperative day were 13.57 mg (10-30) and 15.36 mg (10-30), and the mean (range) doses of morphine used on the 1st and 2nd postoperative day were 14.9 mg (8-28) and 16.3 mg (4-31), respectively. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was 14.2 and 20% for the CR oxycodone and PCA groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oral CR oxycodone 20 mg per day is a cheaper, convenient and an efficacious alternative analgesic to PCA opioids after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",M3
18797963,"Pain levels within 24 hours after UFE: a comparison of morphine and fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia.The purpose of this study was to assess the presence and severity of pain levels during 24 h after uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) for symptomatic leiomyomata and compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of morphine patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) versus fentanyl PCA. We carried out a prospective, nonrandomized study of 200 consecutive women who received UFE and morphine or fentanyl PCA after UFE. Pain perception levels were obtained on a 0-10 scale for the 24-h period after UFE. Linear regression methods were used to determine pain trends and differences in pain trends between two groups and the association between pain scores and patient covariates. One hundred eighty-five patients (92.5%) reported greater-than-baseline pain after UFE, and 198 patients (99%) required IV opioid PCA. One hundred thirty-six patients (68.0%) developed nausea during the 24-h period. Seventy-two patients (36%) received morphine PCA and 128 (64%) received fentanyl PCA, without demographic differences. The mean dose of morphine used was 33.8 +/- 26.7 mg, while the mean dose of fentanyl was 698.7 +/- 537.4 lg. Using this regimen, patients who received morphine PCA had significantly lower pain levels than those who received fentanyl PCA (p \ 0.0001). We conclude that patients develop pain requiring IV opioid PCA within 24 h after UFE. Morphine PCA is more effective in reducing post-uterine artery embolization pain than fentanyl PCA. Nausea is a significant adverse effect from opioid PCA.",M3

METHODS: Patients undergoing burns dressings changes were given a PCA device of ketamine and midazolam to use during the procedure. The aims were to investigate the efficacy of the device and to ascertain what (if any) adverse effects were associated with its use. RESULTS: During the trial period, 44 patients who underwent 95 separate procedures were enrolled. The effectiveness of the device was rated (out of 10) by both staff and patients with the mean scores being 8.47 and 8.50, respectively. In all but 1 case, the proposed procedure was carried out successfully. Thirteen patients reported a total of 23 adverse effects, with hallucinations (11) being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ketamine/midazolam delivered by PCA was shown to be an effective means of pain control during burns dressings as assessed by both staff and patients. The incidence of adverse events was low.",M3

METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy of ASA status I-II were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: C2 group was pretreated with epidural clonidine 2 microg/kg at the L2-3 interspace, 15 min later, epidural anesthesia was performed with 0.5% levobupivacaine, and then 0. 4 microg/ml combined with levobupivacaine 2 mg/ml was given for postoperative epidural patient-controlled analgesia. C4 group was pretreated with epidural clonidine 4 microg/kg, and C0 group was pretreated with normal saline. The analgesic effect, PCA drug dosage, adverse reaction, and visual analog scale (VAS) score were recorded. RESULTS: Anesthesia was clinically satisfactory in all patients. The rate of atropine use of the C4 group was 30%, significantly higher than those of the C2 group (15% ) and C0 group (5%, both P &lt; 0.05). The rate of VAS &lt; or = 3 at rest 24 h postoperatively of the C2 and C4 groups were 88% and 93% respectively, both significantly higher than that of the C0 group (75%, P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01). The rate of VAS &lt; or = 3 while coughing 24 h postoperatively of the C2 and C4 groups were 61% and 79% respectively, both significantly higher than that of the C0 group (48%). The dosages of PCA drug of the C2 and C4 groups were significantly lower than that of the C0 group by 11.8% and 22.8% respectively (both P &lt; 0.05). The dosage of PCA drug 0-4 h after operation of the C2 was significantly higher than that of the C4 group. The sedative degree of the C4 group was higher than that of the C0 group. The rate of postoperative vomiting of the C0 group was 40%, significantly higher than that of the C4 group (10%, P &lt; 0.05).

18670328,"Effect of ramosetron on patient-controlled analgesia related nausea and vomiting after spine surgery in highly susceptible patients: comparison with ondansetron.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of ramosetron with that of ondansetron on opioid-based IV patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) related postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in highly susceptible patients after lumbar spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Optimal postoperative pain management is important to facilitate early mobilization after lumbar spine surgery. Opioid analgesia is associated with a high incidence of PONV. Among the currently available 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 antagonists (5-HT3), ondansetron is being most widely used with unsatisfactory results regarding opioid-based IV PCA related PONV. Ramosetron is a newly developed 5-HT3 antagonist with higher receptor affinity and longer duration of action having theoretical advantage over ondansetron in this setting. However, data to support this view are lacking. METHODS: All 94 female nonsmoker patients (aged 18-65 years) were randomly allocated into either ondansetron group (group O, n = 47) or ramosetron group (group R, n = 47). Fentanyl-based IV PCA was administered for 48 hours after surgery. Overall incidence and severity of nausea and incidence of vomiting were assessed for 48 hours after surgery. Secondary measures included: pain intensity and total amount of administered rescue analgesic. RESULTS: Patients' characteristics were similar between the groups. Overall incidence of nausea was similar between the groups; however, moderate to severe degree of nausea was significantly more in the group O (34%) than in the group R (13%) 6 to 24 hours after surgery. Overall incidence of vomiting and use of rescue antiemetic 6 to 24 hours after surgery was significantly lower in the group R (30% vs. 11% and 28% vs. 11%, respectively). Pain scores at 24 to 48 hours after surgery were significantly lower in the group R (31 +/- 25 vs. 13 +/- 15). CONCLUSION: Ramosetron was superior to ondansetron in terms of preventing vomiting and reducing the severity of nausea related to fentanyl-based IV PCA, with less adverse events, in patients with high susceptibility, undergoing lumbar spine surgery.",M3
18635469,"The prevalence of and risk factors for adverse events in children receiving patient-controlled analgesia by proxy or patient-controlled analgesia after surgery.BACKGROUND: Recent reports emphasize the risks associated with patient-controlled analgesia by proxy (<e>PCA</e>-P), yet data regarding such risks in children remain sparse. We compared the prevalence of clinically significant adverse events in children receiving PCA-P versus PCA, and examined factors that place children at increased risk. METHODS: The records were reviewed of opioid-naïve children, ages birth to 18 yr, who received PCA or PCA-P after surgery. Data included demographics, comorbidities, perioperative information, pain, sedation, and respiratory assessments, oxygen saturation, analgesics, adverse outcomes, and interventions. RESULTS: This study included 145 children who received PCA-P and 157 PCA. The PCA-P group was younger and had more comorbidities (P &lt; 0.05). Opioid orders were similar, but pain scores and opioid dosages were lower, and fewer children received diazepam in the PCA-P group (P &lt; 0.05). Clinically significant adverse events (i.e., those requiring intervention) occurred in 22% and 24% of patients in the PCA-P and PCA groups, respectively; however, more children in the PCA group had  threshold events  (minor intervention) and more in the PCA-P group had  rescue events  (opioid reversal or escalation of level of care). Respiratory events occurred earlier in the PCA-P group (P &lt; 0.05). Factors associated with adverse events included orthopedic surgery, cognitive impairment, respiratory comorbidity, use of continuous basal opioid infusion, use of diazepam, and larger opioid doses on days 1, 2, and 3. Yet, cognitive impairment and opioid dose on day 1 were the only factors independently predictive of these events. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that although a significant number of children receiving PCA and PCA-P experienced adverse events, there was no difference in the prevalence between groups. The PCA-P group was at greater risk for events requiring rescue interventions, perhaps due to the prevalence of underlying comorbidities. These findings emphasize the need for vigilant monitoring to facilitate early recognition and timely intervention of respiratory depression.",M3
18640992,"Combination of opioid agonist and agonist-antagonist: patient-controlled analgesia requirement and adverse events among different-ratio morphine and nalbuphine admixtures for postoperative pain.BACKGROUND: Nalbuphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid, has a potential to attenuate the mu-opioid effects and to enhance the kappa-opioid effects. However, when morphine and nalbuphine are mixed together, the clinical interactions in different combining ratios on analgesic effect and adverse events are unknown. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind controlled study investigated five different combining ratios of morphine and nalbuphine in 311 patients undergoing gynaecologic operations. The concentrations [morphine (mg ml(-1))]/[nalbuphine (mg ml(-1))] were 1/0 in Group 1, 0.75/0.25 (ratio 1:3) in Group 2, 0.5/0.5 (ratio 1:1) in Group 3, 0.25/0.75 (ratio 3:1) in Group 4, and 0/1 in Group 5. Patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) requirement, postoperative pain, and adverse events were evaluated throughout the postoperative 24 h period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hour PCA requirements were similar among the five groups. Verbal rating scores for pain were statistically higher in Groups 2 and 4 than in Group 3. The incidences of pruritus were higher in Group 1 (15.6%) than in Group 2 (6.2%), Group 3 (3.4%), Group 4 (1.6%), and Group 5 (0%). The incidences and severity of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between morphine and nalbuphine in PCA admixture on analgesia is additive. Combinations of morphine and nalbuphine in PCA can decrease the incidence of pruritus, and the antipruritus effect is ratio-dependent. This may provide a novel combination strategy of opioid agonist and agonist-antagonist for postoperative pain management after gynaecologic surgery.",M3
18612876,"Comparison of two patient-controlled analgesia techniques on neuropsychological functioning in the immediate postoperative period.Pain may contribute to cognitive decline, which is a common complication in the early postoperative period. We compared the effects of two common pain management techniques, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>-IV) and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), on cognitive functioning in the immediate postoperative period. Patients hospitalized for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (30 patients per group). A battery of objective, standardized neuropsychological tests was administered preoperatively and 24 hours after surgery. Pain intensity was also evaluated. Nonoperated volunteers served as controls. Patients of the PCA-IV group exhibited significantly higher pain scores than did patients of the PCEA group. PCA-IV patients exhibited significant deterioration in the postoperative period in all the neuropsychological measures, while the PCEA patients exhibited significant deterioration only in one cognitive index, compared to controls.",M3
18617126,"Postoperative analgesia after total hip arthroplasty: patient-controlled analgesia versus transdermal fentanyl patch.STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a new transdermal fentanyl patch (TFP) is a good choice for the postoperative pain management of patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty compared with patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). DESIGN: Randomized, prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: 30 patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either a TFP (group T; Duragesic 50 microg/h, matrix fentanyl patch, Janssen-Cilag) applied approximately 10 hours before induction of general anesthesia and PCA programmed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), or PCA programmed in the PACU (group P). MEASUREMENTS: Intraoperative sufentanil and additional postoperative morphine administration were recorded, as well as visual analog scores and routine vital signs at predetermined intervals during the first 48 hours. MAIN RESULTS: Morphine consumption on arrival in the PACU was 3.5+/-3 mg in group T versus 13+/-5 mg in group P (P&lt;0.0001). Visual analog scores on arrival in the PACU were 37+/-22 mm in group T versus 73+/-13 mm in group P (P&lt;0.0001). Cumulative morphine consumption at the 24th hour was 43+/-16 mg in group P and 4+/-3 mg in group T (P&lt;0.0001). Cumulative morphine consumption at the 48th hour was 54+/-26 mg in group P and 5+/-4 mg in group T (P&lt;0.0001). Intraoperative sufentanil consumption was 38+/-15 microg in group T versus 30+/-5 microg in group P (not significant). The sedation score was 0 in both groups during the first 48 postoperative hours. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative TFP application decreases pain scores and morphine consumption in the PACU and appears to have prolonged effects spanning the first 48 postoperative hours.",M3
18602474,"Ketamine spares morphine consumption after transthoracic lung and heart surgery without adverse hemodynamic effects.BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy is associated with severe pain. Large doses of morphine can depress respiratory drive and compromise hemodynamic stability. Ketamine reduces hyperalgesia, prevents opioid tolerance and resistance and lowers morphine consumption. At sub-anesthetic (&lt; or = 500 microg/kg) doses, ketamine rarely produces undesirable hemodynamic alterations. We hypothesized that by combining a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine with morphine, we could effectively control pain with less morphine and minimize drowsiness, while maintaining safe hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. METHODS: Sequential patients undergoing anterolateral thoracotomy for MIDCAB, lung tumor resection, or median sternotomy for OPCAB were randomized to one of the two intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-<e>PCA</e>) protocols. MO-only patients received 1.5 mg MO bolus, and MK patients received 1.0 mg MO+5 mg ketamine/bolus, both with a 7 min lockout time. IV-PCA was initiated when the patient was sufficiently awake (&gt; or = 5/10 VAS) and rated pain &gt; or = 5/10 on a 0-10 VAS. Rescue intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg was available. Follow-up of respiratory, hemodynamic and pain statuses lasted 72 h. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients completed the 6-month study. Heart rate and blood pressures were identically stable in both groups. Respiratory rate and pulse oximetry were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the MK than in the MO group. MO patients (n = 28) used twice (2.0 +/-2.3 mg/patient/h) the amount of morphine compared to MK patients (n = 30, 1.0 +/- 1.4 mg/patient/h, P &lt; 0.05). Thirty-six hours after starting PCA, 10 MO patients still required IV-PCA compared to 5 MK patients (P &lt; 0.05). Diclofenac was used 70% more in MO than in MK patients. MO patients suffered more postoperative nausea and vomiting. No patients had hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant use of sub-anesthetic ketamine plus two-thirds the standard MO dose following thoracotomy, MIDCAB or OPCAB resulted in lower pain scores, reduced MO consumption and shorter postoperative IV-PCA dependence. These advantages were associated with cardiovascular stability and even better respiratory parameters.",M3
18612266,"Negative words on surgical wards result in therapeutic failure of patient-controlled analgesia and further release of cortisol after abdominal surgeries.BACKGROUND: The perception of pain is germane to the environmental stimuli. Nurses on surgical wards are the main contributor in influencing patients' psychophysiological fettle. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different words, negative or positive, from nurses on postoperative pain therapy with patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>). METHODS: 1500 ASA I-II patients, who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, were screened and 771 were randomized into one of four groups. In the no words group (NW, N.=35), no words was delivered. The positive (PW, N.=248), partially negative (NW1, N.=241) and totally negative (NW2, N.=247) groups received corresponding words when treating with morphine PCA, the words were given singly at the 3(rd), 6(th), 12(th), 18(th) h and repeatedly at the 3(rd) and 6(th) h, and each group was redivided into six subgroups according to varying time points. Pain intensity, morphine consumption, side effects, overall sedation and satisfaction scores were recorded and plasma cortisol was tested. RESULTS: A total of 614 patients completed the study. Negative words expressed significant influence on pain therapy at the 3(rd) and 6(th) h after surgeries (P&lt;0.01), and this effect was more convenient in repeatedly treated patients (P&lt;0.001). Positive and the 12(th) and 18(th) h negative words displayed little role in pain management. Morphine consumption, side effects, satisfaction and cortisol level converted with the change of the pain intensity. No intergroup differences were observed in patients' overall conditions. CONCLUSION: Negative words on surgical wards influenced postoperative pain management at the earlier period of time after abdominal surgeries associated with the HPA axis activation.",M3

18583219,"Effect of combining ultralow-dose naloxone with morphine in intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: the cut-off ratio of naloxone to morphine for antiemesis after gynecologic surgery.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Admixing an ultralow dose of naloxone with intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) has been shown to decrease postoperative nausea. However, the cut-off ratio of the naloxone-morphine admixture for antiemetic effects has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cut-off ratio of naloxone-morphine admixture in PCA for antiemesis after gynecologic surgery. METHODS: This double-blind study enrolled 120 female patients who were scheduled for gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 40 for each group). The concentration of naloxone and morphine respectively was 0 microg/mL and 1 mg/mL in group 1, 0.1 microg/mL and 1 mg/mL in group 2 (1:10,000), and 1 microg/mL and 1 mg/mL in group 3 (1:1000). Morphine consumption, verbal rating score of wound pain at rest and with exertion, and morphine-related side effects were investigated at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients completed the study (37 in group 1, 36 in group 2, 39 in group 3). The incidence of nausea during the postoperative 4-24 hours was significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1 (23.1% vs. 56.8%, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the overall incidence of severe nausea was significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1 (2.6% vs. 24.3%, p &lt; 0.05) as was the rescue antiemetic requirements (5.1% vs. 24.3%, p &lt; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between groups 2 and 1. The pain scores (at rest and with exertion) and 24-hour morphine consumption were not significantly different among the three groups. CONCLUSION: The antiemetic efficacy of ultralow-dose naloxone combined with PCA morphine is limited by a cut-off ratio of naloxone to morphine of 1:10,000.",M3
18544002,"Parecoxib versus dipyrone (metamizole) for postoperative pain relief after hysterectomy : a prospective, single-centre, randomized, double-blind trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors provide postoperative pain relief similar to conventional NSAIDs. However, many of these non-opioid analgesics are available only for oral administration, and are therefore ineffective in patients experiencing postoperative nausea or vomiting. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of the COX-2 inhibitor parecoxib with that of dipyrone (metamizole) administered intravenously for 48 hours after vaginal hysterectomy. METHODS: Fifty women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy under general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to two groups: the parecoxib group, who received intravenous parecoxib 40 mg intraoperatively and every 12 hours after surgery over a period of 48 hours, and the dipyrone group, who received intravenous dipyrone 2.5 g injected intraoperatively, followed by dipyrone 1 g every 6 hours after surgery over a period of 48 hours. Because of the double-blinded study protocol, patients in the parecoxib groups were required to receive placebo infusions 6, 18, 30 and 42 hours after the operation. Visual analogue scale (VAS [scale 0-10]) scores were recorded 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours after surgery. To assess the cumulative opioid administration, all patients were fitted with an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) device containing the opioid piritramide. An alpha value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: VAS scores did not differ between groups with one exception: VAS scores were lower in the parecoxib group 12 hours after surgery than in the dipyrone group (1 and 2, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences in cumulative piritramide administration were measured between groups 1 hour or 24 hours after surgery (parecoxib 14.7 [+/- SD 4.4] and 30.6 [+/- 12.8] mg, respectively; dipyrone 11.8 [+/- 4.9] and 36.5 [+/- 10.7] mg, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib 40 mg twice daily provides postoperative pain relief equivalent to that of dipyrone 4 g daily during the first 48 hours in patients after hysterectomy.",M3
18551260,"[Postoperative pain management. Application of an iontophoretic patient-activated transdermal system]Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (i.v. <e>PCA</e>) for parenteral postoperative pain control is considered standard therapy as patients can individually titrate the amount of analgesic as needed. Iontophoretic patient-activated transdermal systems (IPATS) are a new non-invasive pre-programmed method for postoperative pain control. By pressing the dosing button a 40 microg dose of fentanyl is delivered over a 10 min period via iontophoresis through the intact skin. Several comparative randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that IPATS provide postoperative pain control equivalent to i.v. PCA with morphine. Thus, IPATS is a new method in the management of acute postoperative pain which increases patient mobility and reduces time and effort of care as well as the risk of programming errors. In this review the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, handling and process cost-effectiveness of IPATS are discussed.",M3
19811422,"Asymmetric IgG antibodies induced by different immunotherapies in a murine model of allergy.Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is the only potentially curative treatment for those allergic processes mediated by IgE. We compared the effects of different SITs in mice sensitised with ovalbumin (OVA) Al (OH)(3) : 1) OVA entrapped in particles of poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-OVA), 2) Soluble OVA (OVA-sol) and 3) Polymerised OVA (OVA-pol). Serum levels of specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2a and asymmetric IgG, the cutaneous anaphylaxis test (<e>PCA</e>), and the IL-10, IFNgamma and IL-4 levels in culture supernatants of splenocytes challenged with OVA were assessed. Mice treated with PLGA-OVA had higher levels of asymmetric antibodies than non-desensitised mice; a low IgG1 and high IgG2a level was observed together with inhibitory effect in the PCA reaction that reversed in the absence of asymmetric IgG. IL-10 and IFNgamma levels were higher in supernatants from mice treated with PLGA-OVA and OVA-sol than those obtained from non-desensitised controls. Our results suggest that among the different SITs evaluated, PLGA-OVA is the one that best showed an increase in the asymmetric IgG molecules and an effective deviation of the immune response. Furthermore, the increase in the proportion of asymmetric antibodies would be of importance when designing new vaccination strategies for allergy.",M4
18541691,"Implementation of standard order sets for patient-controlled analgesia.PURPOSE: The implementation of standard order sets for patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) is described. SUMMARY: A review of naloxone usage at the University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) from January to June 2004 found that 8% of patients receiving PCA had severe respiratory depression. A subanalysis of each event found that 85% of these patients had never before received opioid therapy. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression with PCA, separate standard order sets were developed for patients new to or tolerant of opioid therapy. A major component of both order sets was the standardization of a 10-minute lockout interval between each PCA dose. Implementation of the new PCA order sets raised concerns among health care professionals at UMMC that medication safety may be improved at the cost of increased pain. After implementation of the order sets, prescriber compliance, pharmacist interventions, the frequency of adverse effects, and patients' pain management were evaluated. After implementation of standard order sets for patients receiving PCA, 57% of patients' pain was documented as being controlled, and the orders for 93% of patients were in compliance with the recommended dosage interval of &gt; or =10 minutes. There were no reports of oversedation or respiratory depression requiring reversal with naloxone. CONCLUSION: The implementation of standard order sets for PCA resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of cases of severe respiratory depression and increased use of the order set for patients new to opioid therapy. Changing the order sets to improve medication safety did not appear to negatively affect patients' satisfaction with pain management.",M3
19426688,"Morin inhibits Fyn kinase in mast cells and IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity response in vivo.Mast cells are responsible for IgE-mediated allergic responses. Although dietary flavonoid morin has been known to suppress mast cell activation, its in vivo anti-allergic activity and the underlying mechanisms remain are largely unknown. In this study, we determine whether morin suppresses IgE-mediated allergic responses in an animal model and its mechanism of action. Morin suppressed IgE-mediated <e>PCA</e> in mice (ED50 23.9 mg/kg) and inhibited degranulation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-4 in antigen (Ag)-stimulated mast cells. The mechanism of action was a follows. Morin inhibited the activating phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and linker for activation of T cells (LAT) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Akt and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were inhibited as well. In vitro kinase assay indicated that Fyn kinase, not Lyn and Syk, was inhibited by morin in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 5.7 microM). In conclusion, the results suggest that morin suppresses the IgE-mediated allergic response by primarily inhibiting Fyn kinase in mast cells.",M4

Orally and intraperitoneally administered mangiferin potently inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex as well as pruritus induced by compound 48/80 in mice. Mangiferin also inhibited the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the IgE-switching cytokine IL-4 as well as transcription factor NF-kappaB activation in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by IgE-antigen complex. These findings suggest that mangiferin may improve PCA reaction and pruritus.",M4
19394399,"Houttuynia cordata water extract suppresses anaphylactic reaction and IgE-mediated allergic response by inhibiting multiple steps of FcepsilonRI signaling in mast cells.Houttuynia cordata has been used as a traditional medicine in Korea and is known to have antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-allergic activities. The precise effect of H. cordata, however, remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of H. cordata water extract (HCWE) on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in mice and on IgE-mediated allergic response in rat mast RBL-2H3 cells. Oral administration of HCWE inhibited IgE-mediated systemic PCA in mice. HCWE also reduced antigen (DNP-BSA)-induced release of beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, and reactive oxygen species in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, HCWE inhibited antigen-induced IL-4 and TNF-alpha production and expression in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. HCWE inhibited antigen-induced activation of NF-kappaB and degradation of IkappaB-alpha. To investigate the inhibitory mechanism of HCWE on degranulation and cytokine production, we examined the activation of intracellular FcepsilonRI signaling molecules. HCWE suppressed antigen-induced phosphorylation of Syk, Lyn, LAT, Gab2, and PLC gamma2. Further downstream, antigen-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAP kinases (ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 but not p38 MAP kinase) were inhibited by HCWE. Taken together, the in vivo/in vitro anti-allergic effect of HCWE suggests possible therapeutic applications of this agent in inflammatory allergic diseases through inhibition of cytokines and multiple events of FcepsilonRI-dependent signaling cascades in mast cells.",M4
19425227,"Inhibitory mechanism of saponins derived from roots of Platycodon grandiflorum on anaphylactic reaction and IgE-mediated allergic response in mast cells.The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of saponins isolated from the root of Platycodi Radix (Changkil saponins: CKS) anti-allergic effects in mice and mast cells. Oral administration of CKS inhibited the dinitrophenyl (DNP)-IgE antibody-induced systemic <e>PCA</e> reaction in mice. CKS reduced the beta-hexosaminidase and histamine release from anti-DNP-IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, CKS inhibited the IgE antibody-induced increases in IL-4 and TNF-alphaproduction and expression in RBL-2H3 cells. In order to explore the inhibitory mechanism of CKS in PCA and mast cell degranulation, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules. CKS suppressed DNP-IgE antibody-induced Syk phosphorylation. Further downstream, CKS also inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and MAP kinases. Taken together, the in vivo/in vitro anti-allergic effects of CKS suggest possible therapeutic applications for this agent in allergic diseases through the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and Syk-dependent signaling cascades.",M4
19099230,"Anti-allergic activity of an ethanol extract from Salviae miltiorrhiza.As part of an ongoing investigation aimed at the discovery of novel bioactive medicinal herbs with anti-inflammatory properties, the effects of an ethanolic extract from the parts of Salviae miltiorrhiza Bunge (ESM) were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo animal model analysis. ESM inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and COX-1-dependent phases of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) generation in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 3.96 microg/mL and 21.54 microg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, ESM inhibited leukotriene C4 (LTC4) production with an IC50 value of 2.6 microg/mL. These results clearly demonstrated the dual COX-2 selective/5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity that ESM possessed. ESM strongly inhibited a degranulation reaction in a dose dependent manner within a BMMC system, with an IC50 value of 22.4 microg/mL. Additionally, ESM was tested in a rat passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction assay by oral administration (25 to 100 mg/kg). ESM dose-dependently inhibited the PCA reaction, which was activated by anti-dinirophenyl (DNP) IgE. These results suggested that ESM might be beneficial in regulating various allergic reactions.",M4
19318257,"Inhibitory effects of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Eupatorium chinense L. on IgE-mediated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in mice.Sesquiterpene lactones (SQTLs) have been shown to suppress the degranulation as inferred by histamine release in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. In this study, we isolated the 9 kinds of SQTLs from Eupatorium chinense L. and examined the effects of these SQTLs on the degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. The chemical structures of two novel compounds (SQTL-3 and 8) were determined. All the SQTLs suppressed the degranulation from Ag-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. To disclose the inhibitory mechanism of degranulation by SQTLs, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, and PLCgammas and intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). None of these SQTLs showed the activation of Syk and PLCgammas. The intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was elevated by Fc epsilonRI activation, but SQTLs treatment reduced the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i by suppressing Ca(2+) influx. Thus, it was suggested that the suppression of Ag-stimulated degranulation by these SQTLs is mainly due to the decreased Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, in order to clarify the in vivo effect of SQTL-rich extract, we administered SQTL-rich extract to the type I allergic model mice and measured the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex. The SQTLs remarkably suppressed PCA reaction in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, it was suggested that SQTLs would be a candidate as an anti-allergic agent.",M4

HPLC-ECD methods were performed to detect the contents of histamine released from rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80 in vitro. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, RSE could ameliorate the ear swelling and capillary permeability in mice induced by DNFB and PCA. RSE also reduced the thickness of the mice hind paw induced by SRBC in significant dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, RSE obviously inhibited the release of histamine in rat peritoneal mast in vitro, a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: RSE exerts potential anti-allergy effects and the mechanisms may be partly related to its inhibitory effect on the release of histamine from mast cells.",M4
18937215,"Inter-laboratory comparisons of assessment of the allergenic potential of proteins in mice.Assessment of the potential allergenicity of novel proteins, including those expressed in genetically modified plants, is an important issue. In previous studies, we have shown that the IgE measurement induced by systemic exposure of BALB/c mice to a range of proteins correlates broadly with what is known of their allergenic potential in humans. The approach used a homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) assay that reflects IgE-dependent biological activity and is of sufficient sensitivity to detect IgE production in the absence of adjuvant. In previous studies, the immunization phase was conducted independently in two separate facilities, and the subsequent analytical work (PCA) conducted in a single facility. The purpose here was to further evaluate the transferability of this approach. To this end, BALB/c mice were exposed to a range of doses of peanut agglutinin or ovalbumin, allergenic proteins of peanut and hen's egg, respectively, in two independent laboratories. Serial doubling dilutions of serum pooled for each treatment group were analyzed for specific IgE. At higher doses of allergen very similar, or identical, IgE titers were achieved in both laboratories, although at lower doses, responses were somewhat more variable. These data demonstrate that, although technically demanding, the measurement of protein allergen-induced IgE antibody production in mice using PCA is relatively robust and is transferable and reproducible between laboratories. This approach may provide a useful tool for the safety assessment of novel proteins and suggests that continued evaluation of the approach with a wider range of protein allergens and non-sensitising proteins is justified.",M4
18717341,"[Determination of the allergic impurities in the parenteral injection of Chinese traditional medicines containing Salvia miltiorrhiza]The residual protein mixture (the content is 4%, approximately), called Salvia miltiorrhiza antigen, was extracted from the Salvia miltiorrhiza cruel materials by mimicking the alcohol-deposit extracts process. Both rabbits and guinea pigs sensitized by Salvia miltiorrhiza could produce specified antibodies. Large molecular antigenic impurities were extracted from the Danshen injection and Xiangdan injection using the centrifugal filtering method. The test results of active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in guinea pigs confirmed that the extracted antigenic impurities could induce the anaphylaxis reaction in the animals which were sensitized by the Salvia miltiorrhiza antigen. Using the specified antibody produced from rabbits which were sensitiyed by Salvia miltiorrhiza, ELISA test method was developed to test the residual Salvia miltiorrhiza antigenic materials contained in the parenteral Chinese traditional medicines. Calculated as residual protein, the linear range was 0.08-5.12 microg x mL(-1) (r2 = 0.9906), the detection limit and quantization limit are 0.08 microg x mL(-1) and 0.4 microg x mL(-1), respectively. 308 batches of parenteral Chinese traditional medicines containing water-soluable components of Salvia miltiorrhiza were tested, and the Salvia miltiorrhiza antigenic impurities were spotted in 35 (11.4%) batches of samples. The test results show that the extracting process currently used can not remove the Salvia miltiorrhiza antigenic impurities completely, and this may be one of the reasons for anaphylactic reaction in clinics. The proposed ELISA method can be used for improving the manufacture process and for routine quality control of drug products.",M4
18721841,"Augmentation of antigen-stimulated allergic responses by a small amount of trichloroethylene ingestion from drinking water.In previous report, we have shown that trichloroethylene (TCE) increases histamine release and inflammatory cytokine production from antigen-stimulated mast cells. In this study, we examined the enhancing effect of a small amount of TCE ingestion from drinking water on antigen-stimulated allergic responses. After exposure of Wistar rats to TCE ingestion for 2 or 4 weeks, we performed a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction. TCE ingestion for 2 and 4 weeks enhanced PCA reaction in a dose-dependent manner. On histological examination, TCE ingestion for 2 weeks exacerbated inflammation characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and accumulation of mast cells around the vessel in the skin. After TCE ingestion for 4 weeks, the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) showed increase of the size and wet weight, and germinal centers changed distinctly. The interleukin-4 (IL-4) mRNA levels on spleen, MLNs and leukocytes were increased. Moreover, serum total IgE levels of TCE ingestion increased in a time-dependent manner. Our results suggest that TCE ingestion induces pro-inflammatory responses and causes Th1/Th2-type helper T-cell imbalance. And more, a small amount of TCE ingestion may lead to the initiation and acceleration of type I allergic reaction.",M4

To evaluate antiallergic effect of PL, we isolated its main constituents, paeoniflorin and paeonol, and evaluated in vivo their inhibitory effects against passive cutaenous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex and scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80. PL, paeoniflorin and paeonol potently inhibited PCA reaction and scratching behaviors in mice. Paeoniflorin exhibited the most potent inhibition against scratching behaviors and the acetic acid-induced writhing syndrome in mice. Paeonol most potently inhibited PCA reaction and mast cells degranulation. These findings suggest that PL can improve IgE-induced anaphylaxis and scratching behaviors, and may be due to the effect of its constituents, paeoniflorin and paeonol.",M4

We screened approximately 100 oriental herbal medicines for anti-allergic activity. Sophorae flos exhibited the most potent effect on degranulation in antigen-stimulated mast cells. We further investigated the effect of Sophorae flos on the IgE-mediated allergic response in vivo and its mechanism of action in mast cells. Sophorae flos exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on degranulation in antigen-stimulated mast cells with IC(50) values of approximately 31.6 microg/mL (RBL-2H3 mast cells) and approximately 47.8 microg/mL (bone marrow-derived mast cells). Sophorae flos also suppressed the expression and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in the cells and IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in mice. Sophorae flos inhibited the activating phosphorylation of Syk and LAT in mast cells. Further downstream, activating phosphorylation of Akt and the prototypic MAP kinases, namely, p38, ERK1/2, and JNK, were also inhibited. These results suggest that Sophorae flos inhibits the Src family kinase-dependent signaling cascades in mast cells and may thus exert anti-allergic activity.",M4
18261158,"Camellia japonica suppresses immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic response by the inhibition of Syk kinase activation in mast cells.BACKGROUND: Novel approaches are being explored to develop new therapies for various allergic diseases. Complementary and alternative medicines are considered to be promising avenues for the development of such new therapies. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of many Korean plants on the IgE-mediated allergic response in mast cells and in vivo, and its mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-allergic activity was tested by evaluating effects on degranulation of mast cells in culture and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in vivo. Its mechanism of action was investigated by immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitation, RT-PCR, and other molecular biological approaches in mast cells. RESULTS: We screened approximately 100 natural plant extracts collected in Korea for in vitro anti-allergic activity. The leaf extract of Camellia japonica (LECJ) exhibited the most potent effect on degranulation in antigen-stimulated rodent and human mast cells. LECJ reversibly inhibited degranulation in a dose-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of approximately 50 microg/mL for the mast cells, and it also suppressed the expression and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in rat basophilic leukaemia-2H3 mast cells. In agreement with its in vitro activity, LECJ significantly inhibited mast cell-mediated PCA in an animal model. LECJ inhibited activating phosphorylation of tyrosine Y371 on Syk kinase, indicating that LECJ inhibits the activity of Src-family kinases in mast cells. In the in vitro kinase assay, LECJ directly inhibited Lyn kinase, the major Src-family kinase in the cells. It also suppressed Akt and MAP kinases, which are critical for the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines in mast cells. In high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, quercetin-3-beta-D-glucoside and eugenol were identified as the major active components. CONCLUSION: The present results strongly suggest that the anti-allergic activity of LECJ is mediated through inhibiting degranulation and allergic cytokine secretion by inhibition of Src-family kinase in mast cells and it may be useful for the treatment of mast cell-related immediate and delayed allergic diseases.",M4
18309276,"Lactic acid bacterial fermentation increases the antiallergic effects of Ixeris dentata.Ixeris dentata (ID, family Asteraceae), called Seumbakuy in Korea, was fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antiallergic activities were investigated. Fermentation of ID with Bifidobacterium breve or Lactobacillus acidophilus increased its inhibition of degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells induced by the IgE-antigen complex. Oral administration of these extracts to mice inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by the IgE-antigen complex and scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80. The fermented ID more potently inhibited the PCA reaction and scratching behaviors than the non-fermented one. These extracts also inhibited mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-4, as well as NF-kappaB activation in RBL-2H3 cells induced by the IgE-antigen complex. These findings suggest that LAB fermentation improves ID-mediated inhibition of IgE-induced allergic diseases such as rhinitis and asthma, and that ID works by inhibiting degranulation and NF-kB activation in mast cells and basophils.",M4
17978493,"Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 on experimental allergic rhinitis in BALB/c mice.We investigated the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-55 isolated from infant feces on experimental allergic rhinitis in BALB/c mice. The heat-treated cells of strain L-55 were orally administrated for 4 consecutive weeks to mice sensitized by ovalbumin (OVA), and nasal symptoms (sneezing and nasal rubbing) induced by OVA challenge were evaluated. Strain L-55 at doses of 1 and 10 mg cells/mouse significantly inhibited nasal symptoms by repeated administration over a period of 2 weeks. Furthermore, we measured the level of OVA-specific IgE titers in the serum by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction. PCA titers in the sera from mice administrated strain L-55 were significantly lowered compared with the control. These results suggest that oral administration of strain L-55 may be useful for alleviating the nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis.",M4

These isolated components potently inhibited the release of beta-hexosaminidase from RBL-2H3 cells induced by the IgE-antigen complex, with IC(50) values of 3.4 and 4.5muM, respectively. Eupatilin and jaceosidin potently inhibited the PCA reaction and scratching behaviors induced by IgE- antigen complex and compound 48/80, respectively. Orally administered jaceosidin more potently inhibited the PCA reaction than that of eupatilin, although the PCA reaction-inhibitory activity of intraperitoneally administered jaceosidin was nearly the same as that of eupatilin. Eupatilin and jaceosidin inhibited the gene expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in RBL-2H3 cells stimulated by IgE-antigen complex. Eupatilin and jaceosidin inhibited the activation of NF-kB. Based on these findings, eupatilin and jaceosidin may be useful for protection from the PCA and itching reactions, which are IgE-mediated representative skin allergic diseases.",M4

Using a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) model, the antianaphylactic effects of EA were examined. Interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured using the ELISA method. The level of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB/RelA protein and NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was determined using the Western blot analysis and the transcription factor enzyme-linked immunoassay method. RESULTS: EA inhibits PCA and beta-hexosaminidase release, IL-6 secretion on the PCA, and in addition, EA reduces NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that EA may possess antianaphylactic and antiinflammatory properties.",M4
17721724,"Observations of Forsythia koreana methanol extract on mast cell-mediated allergic reactions in experimental models.To explore effects of Forsythia koreana methanol extract (FKME) on mast cell-mediated allergic and inflammatory properties, the effect of FKME was evaluated on compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis, ear swelling, and anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) immunoglobulin E (IgE)-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>). In addition, the effect of FKME was investigated on the histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs) stimulated by compound 48/80, which promotes histamine release. The human mast cell line HMC-1 was stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187. Activated HMC-1 can produce several proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8. Cytokine levels in the culture supernatant were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytotoxicity by FKME was determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. FKME inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylactic shock and ear swelling in mice. When 1 g/kg FKME was pretreated or posttreated with mice, compound 48/80-induced mice morality was 50 and 66.7%, respectively. One gram per kilogram of FKME pretreatment inhibited ear-swelling responses derived from compound 48/80 by 29.75%. A PCA reaction was inhibited by 17.9%. In an in vitro model, FKME (1 mg/ml) inhibited histamine release from the RPMCs by 13.8% and TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 production from HMC-1 cells by 71.16% (P &lt; 0.001), 86.72% (P &lt; 0.001), and 44.6%, respectively. However, FKME had no cytotoxic effects on cell viability. In conclusion, FKME inhibited not only systemic anaphylaxis and ear swelling induced by compound 48/80 but also inhibited a PCA reaction induced by anti-DNP IgE in vivo. Treatment with FKME showed significant inhibitory effects on histamine, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 release from mast cells.",M4
17581197,"Novel IgE peptide-based vaccine prevents the increase of IgE and down-regulates elevated IgE in rodents.BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with anti-IgE antibodies for treatment of allergy is promising but a short half-life and extremely high cost limit its application. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop IgE vaccines that induce longer-lasting auto-antibodies to neutralize self-IgE as an alternative therapy. METHODS: The vaccine was made by conjugating three synthetic peptides corresponding to human IgE receptor-binding sites to a carrier, hepatitis B surface antigen. To test the immunogenicity of the vaccine, rats were immunized with the vaccine or hepatitis B surface antigen as control. Serum IgG titres to human IgE and the IgE of other species were measured. The inhibition by rat antisera of the binding of human IgE to its receptor was assessed by ELISA, flow cytometry analysis, and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>), and its ability to recognize receptor-bound IgE was examined. The in vivo effect of the vaccine was evaluated in trichosanthin-sensitized mice and rats. In the preventative study, vaccination started before sensitization commenced, while in the treatment study, vaccination started after sensitization. Sensitized mice and rats receiving injections of the carrier served as controls. Trichosanthin-specific IgE was measured using PCA. RESULTS: Sera from vaccine-immunized rats contained high titre antibodies that reacted with soluble and plate-bound but not with receptor-bound human IgE; they also reacted with mouse, rat, and dog IgE. Furthermore, the sera inhibited the binding of human IgE to its receptor in a dose-dependent manner. In preventative and treatment studies, serum trichosanthin-specific IgE levels were significantly reduced in vaccinated groups compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Antibodies against self-IgE can be induced by IgE peptide-based vaccines, which are effective in preventing the increase of IgE and in down-regulating IgE in sensitized animals.",M4
17643865,"Anti-anaphylactic effect of Euphorbia hirta.The Euphorbia hirta ethanolic extract (EH A001) was found to possess a prominent anti-anaphylactic activity. A preventive effect of EH-A001 given by oral route at dose from 100 to 1000 mg/kg was observed against compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis. At the same range of dose, EH-A001 inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rat and active paw anaphylaxis in mice. A suppressive effect of EH-A001 was observed on the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 from anti-DNP-HSA activated rat peritoneal mast cells.",M4
17544150,"Anti-allergic properties of a new all-D synthetic immunoglobulin-binding peptide.Using a combinatorial chemistry approach, we identified a tetrameric tripeptide, denoted Protein A Mimetic (PAM) or TG19318, able to bind to immunoglobulins of different classes and species. The inverso variant, with the tripeptide in the all-D configuration (D-PAM or TG19320), is described as retaining binding properties to Ig. This peptide has now been assayed as a binder for E class immunoglobulins, in linear and competitive ELISA experiments, dot-blot and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. We show that D-PAM binds IgE with high specificity and selectivity, the interaction being sufficient to inhibit anaphylactic release of beta-hexosaminidase from RBL 2H3 cells, with an IC50 value of 10 microg/mL. Intradermal administration of D-PAM suppresses <e>PCA</e> in the rat, with an IC50 of 1.25 microg/kg dose of peptide, while its intraperitoneal injection inhibits mouse PCA with an IC50 of about 7 mg/kg and an efficacy comparable to that of ketotifen. Similarly, D-PAM inhibits ACA in the mouse, with 50% suppression at 10 mg/kg. The results presented here show that the peptide is active on the studied models, with effective doses below toxicity level, hence the molecule is a promising candidate for development of a new class of anti-allergic drugs.",M4
17546203,"Gamijeonssibaekchulsan regulates mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reaction.Gamijeonssibaekchulsan (GJBS) is a typical Oriental medicine prescription which has been used in Korea for the treatment of allergic diseases and the development of physical strength. However, as yet there is no clear explanation of how GJBS affects the anaphylactic reaction and the immune function. In the present study murine models and MOLT-4 cells, a T cell line, were used to investigate these effects. Compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylactic shock and ear swelling response were firstly analyzed. We also assayed histamine release and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in mice and cytokine productions in MOLT-4 cells. GJBS significantly inhibits compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylactic shock and ear swelling response. GJBS also inhibits histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. PCA activated by anti-dinitrophenyl immunoglobulin E is attenuated by GJBS. However, GJBS dose not affect the production of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-4 in MOLT-4 cells. These results indicate that GJBS has a potential regulatory effect on allergic reactions that are mediated by mast cells.",M4
17202687,"In vitro and in vivo antiallergic effect of the fructus of Evodia rutaecarpa and its constituents.The unripe fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa (JUSS) BENTH (ER, Family Rutaceae) has been used frequently as a traditional medicine against inflammatory diseases in Korea, China and Japan. To evaluate antiallergic effect of ER, we isolated its main constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, and evaluated in vivo their inhibitory effects against passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by IgE-antigen complex and scratching behaviors by compound 48/80. ER and its constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, potently inhibited PCA reaction and scratching behaviors in mice, although ER weakly inhibited scratching behaviors. Evodiamine and rutaecarpine inhibited TNF-alpha and IL-4 protein expression in RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE-antigen complex, although these did not inhibit degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE-antigen complex and rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. These findings suggest that ER and its constituents, evodiamine and rutaecarpine, may be effective for IgE-induced allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and rhinitis.",M4
17541172,"Inhibitory effect of schizandrin on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and scratching behaviors in mice.To evaluate the antiallergic effect of the fruit of Schizandra chinensis Baill (Family Magnoliaceae), which inhibited the mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction in a preliminary experiment, its main constituent, schizandrin, was isolated and its antiallergic effect investigated. Schizandrin inhibited the PCA reaction induced by the IgE-antigen complex, the scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80 and the serum IgE production induced by ovalbumin. Schizandrin also inhibited the in vitro degranulation of compound 48/80-induced rat peritoneal mast cells and IgE-induced RBL 2H3 cells. Schizandrin reduced the protein expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-4 in IgE-induced RBL 2H3 cells. These findings suggest that schizandrin can improve IgE-induced anaphylaxis and scratching behaviors.",M4
17024848,"Lactic acid bacteria increase antiallergic effect of Artemisia princeps pampanini SS-1.Artemisia princeps Pampanini, which is called Ssajuarissuk in Korean (SS-1), was fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction-inhibitory activity was investigated. Of these fermented agents, SS-1 extract fermented with Bifidobacterium infantis K-525 (F-SS-1) most effectively inhibited the release of P-hexosamindase from RBL-2H3 cells induced IgE. In IgE-induced RBL-2H3 cells, F-SS-1 inhibited proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA expression. Oral administration of SS-1 and F-SS-1 to mice inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction induced by IgE and scratching behaviors induced by compound 48/80. The inhibitory activity of F-SS-1 against scratching behaviors was more effective than that of SS-1. These findings suggest that the fermentation of SS-1 with LAB can increase its antiallergic activity.",M4
17141437,"Immunological and allergenic responses induced by latex fractions of Calotropis procera (Ait.) R.Br.Immunological and allergenic responses against the latex of Calotropis procera were investigated in mice by oral and subcutaneous routes. The latex was fractionated according to water solubility and molecular size of its components. The fractions were named as non-dialyzable latex (NDL) corresponding to the major latex proteins, dialyzable latex (DL) corresponding to low molecular size substances and rubber latex (RL) which was highly insoluble in water. Anti-sera against these fractions were assayed for total IgG and IgA titration by ELISA and IgE and IgG(1) were quantified by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rats and mice, respectively. None of the fractions induced antibodies level increases when mice received latex fractions by oral route and thus, did not develop allergy. Nonetheless, anti-sera of mice sensitized with NDL and RL by subcutaneous route displayed considerable immunological response while DL did not. IgG level augmented consistently against NDL and RL while IgA response was detected only to NDL. NDL and RL induced very strong PCA reactions suggesting that both fractions would contain latex substances involved in allergy. Furthermore, protein analysis of NDL and RL suggests that RL still retain residual proteins abundantly found in NDL that could explain its similar allergenic effect. No IgG(1) reaction was detected in any of the anti-sera tested. According to the results, the proteins of latex of Calotropis procera can provoke allergy by subcutaneous route. The NDL has previously shown to display anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities by intraperitoneal injection. It should be relevant to determine whether NDL could induce such activities when assayed by oral route since it was ineffective to induce allergy by this way.",M4
16899984,"Readministration of IgE is required for repeated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice.BACKGROUND: Homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) is an established technique that provides a useful tool to study local inflammation due to mast cell activation. Since mast cells are responsive to repeated challenge by IgE receptor crosslinking in vitro, we investigated the responsiveness of mice to repeated PCA activation. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were sensitized with intradermal injection of IgE into the ear and provocated through intravenous injection of trinitrophenol-BSA. Repeated provocation was administered, and the outcome was determined by colorimetrical measurement of Evans blue dye leakage. RESULTS: After local IgE injection, mice could be challenged to demonstrate a PCA reaction at least up to 13 days after IgE sensitization. In contrast, passively sensitized mice did not respond to repeated antigen challenge, i.e. a second provocation administered between 1 and 12 days after the first PCA reaction. However, if these mice were intradermally resensitized with IgE at the same site after the first challenge, they became responsive to the repeated challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Mast cells become desensitized upon PCA reaction, and resensitization with IgE is critical for mice repeatedly stimulated by PCA activation.",M4
16946499,"Inhibitory effects of Korean red ginseng and its genuine constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 in mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and contact dermatitis models.The inhibitory effects of the Korean red ginseng (steamed root of Panax ginseng C.A. MEYER, family Araliaceae) saponin fraction (KRGS) and its constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 in mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) and contact dermatitis models were measured. Orally administered KRGS and its genuine ginsenosides potently inhibited the PCA reaction induced by IgE. However, when these ginsenosides were intraperitoneally administered, ginsenoside Rh2 showed the most potent inhibition. The ginsenoside Rh2 also the most potently inhibited the beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE with antigen. KRGS administered topically at a dose of 0.1% suppressed ear swelling in an oxazolone-induced mouse contact dermatitis model by 38.8%. Its constituents ginsenosides Rg3, Rf, and Rh2 at a concentration of 0.05% also potently suppressed mouse ear swelling by 47.5%, 34.8%, and 49.9% at 16 d, respectively. These ginsenosides also significantly reduced mRNA expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma induced by oxazolone applied to mouse ears. However, the ginsenosides, except for ginsenoside Rh2, almost did not notably reduce IL-4 levels. The ginsenoside Rh2 also potently inhibited COX-2 and inducible NO synthetase protein expression in liphopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Based on these findings, KRGS and its ginsenosides are suggested to improve atopic and contact dermatitis by regulating expression of cytokines.",M4
16287547,"Sensitization increases esterase-positive macrophage number in appendix from an animal model of food allergy.BACKGROUND: Macrophages are mononuclear cells with phagocytic and antigen presenting properties. The role of macrophages in IgE-dependent allergic reactions and oral tolerance remains unclear. In previous works we demonstrated that ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rabbits present histopathological modifications of the mucosa in different regions of the digestive tract. The present study analyzes macrophage distribution and quantitative modifications in the cecal appendix of OVA-sensitized animals. METHODS: Adult new Zealand rabbits were divided into two groups: G1 (non-sensitized normal controls) and G2 (rabbits sensitized to OVA twice by subcutaneous route, with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant). The alpha-naphthyl esterase technique was used for macrophage detection. RESULTS: Specific anti-OVA IgE was detected in sensitized animals by the <e>PCA</e> (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) method. In 5 regions of the cecal appendix we observed a significant increase in the number of macrophages in sensitized animals (G2) versus the control group (G1). The observed sensitization-mediated increase in cells is probably related to enhanced recruitment of monocytes from peripheral blood towards the appendix. This process could be induced by chemical mediators, and demonstrates macrophage participation in local immune response during sensitization phenomena.",M4
16818790,"Zinc is required for Fc epsilon RI-mediated mast cell activation.Zinc (Zn) is an essential nutrient, and its deficiency causes growth retardation, immunodeficiency, and neuronal degeneration. However, the precise roles and molecular mechanism(s) of Zn function in immune response have not been clarified. Mast cells (MCs) are granulated cells that play a pivotal role in allergic reactions and inflammation. The granules of MCs contain various chemical mediators and inflammatory cytokines that are released upon FcepsilonRI cross-linking. In this study, we report that Zn is essential for MC activation both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that a Zn chelator, N,N,N,N-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine, inhibited in vivo allergic reactions such as <e>PCA</e> and PSA. Consistent with this, N,N,N,N-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine significantly inhibited the FcepsilonRI-induced degranulation and cytokine production. We found that Zn was required for FcepsilonRI-induced translocation of granules to the plasma membrane, a process that we have shown to be important for MC degranulation. In addition, we showed that Zn was essential for plasma membrane translocation of protein kinase C and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, leading to cytokine production, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These results revealed that Zn was involved in multiple steps of FcepsilonRI-induced MC activation and required for degranulation and cytokine production.",M4
15678369,"Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-inhibitory activity of flavanones from Citrus unshiu and Poncirus trifoliata.This study examined the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-inhibitory activity of the flavanones isolated from the pericarp of Citrus unshiu (Family Rutaceae) and the fruit of Poncirus trifoliata (Family Rutaceae). Naringenin, hesperetin and ponciretin potently inhibited IgE-induced beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells and the <e>PCA</e> reaction. Among the flavanones examined, naringenin was the most potent with an IC50 value for beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells of 0.029 mM. Intraperitoneally administered naringenin (5 mg/kg) inhibited PCA by 70 +/- 1.7 %, compared with the control group. The inhibitory activity of naringenin was found to be comparable to that of azelastine, which is a commercially available antiallergic drug. However, their glycosides, hesperidin, naringin and poncirin, did not inhibit the in vitro release of beta-hexosaminidase from the RBL-2H3 cells. On the other hand, these flavanones did not improve the oxazolone-induced dermatitis in the mouse ears. When the flavanone glycosides were administered to rats, the aglycones, but not the flavanone glycosides, were excreted in urine. This suggests that the flavanone glycosides can be activated by intestinal bacteria, and may be effective toward IgE-induced atopic allergies.",M4

Spores contained a concentration of allergens higher than mycelia. Results of PCA tests suggested that spores contained specific allergens. However, in a comparative study of extracts from different species of Cladosporium animal and human models gave different estimates of the allergenic potency of the different species. In spite of these variations it was shown that extracts from spores of Cladosporium contained the highest amount of Cladosporium allergens.",M4
15387643,"Structures of new beta-carboline-type alkaloids with antiallergic effects from Stellaria dichotoma(1,2).The aqueous ethanolic extract from the roots of Stellaria dichotoma showed an antiallergic effect on ear passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction in mice (in vivo) and inhibitory activity on the release of beta-hexosaminidase in RBL-2H3 cells (in vitro). From the aqueous ethanolic extract, new beta-carboline-type alkaloids, dichotomines A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4) and dichotomides I (5) and II (6), were isolated. The structures of the new constituents (1-6) were determined on the basis of chemical and physicochemical evidence, including the application of the modified Mosher's method. The effects of the isolated constituents on the release of beta-hexosaminidase in RBL-2H3 cells were examined, and 3 was found to show inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 62 microM). Moreover, 3 also inhibited the releases of antigen-IgE-mediated TNF-alpha and IL-4 (19 and 15 microM, respectively) in RBL-2H3 cells, both of which participate in the late phase of type I allergic reactions.",M4
15588913,"Evaluation of an in vitro method for the measurement of specific IgE antibody responses: the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell assay.The evaluation of allergenic potential is a key parameter in the safety assessment of novel proteins, including those expressed in genetically modified crops and foodstuffs. The majority of allergic reactions to food proteins are immediate type hypersensitivity reactions in which the principal biological effector is IgE antibody; the accurate measurement of specific IgE antibody is therefore a critical factor in experimental systems designed to characterize protein allergenic potential. Due to the presence of much higher concentrations of other immunoglobulin isotypes, the assessment of specific serum IgE antibody poses substantial technical challenges. We have examined the utility of the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line for the measurement of murine IgE responses. RBL cells were sensitized with mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody and challenged with DNP-albumin conjugates with various hapten substitution ratios (SR). Polyclonal anti-OVA IgE antisera were also assessed for activity in the RBL assay. Results were compared with titers measured in homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) assay. Marked degranulation of RBL cells was induced by conjugates with SRs of between 16 and 32, whereas conjugates with lower SRs (of 10 or 3) failed to elicit significant serotonin release. All conjugates were able to induce mast cell degranulation in vivo in a PCA assay. Anti-OVA antisera with PCA titers of 1/32 to 1/64 failed to stimulate RBL cell degranulation, whereas high titer antibody (1/2048 to 1/4096 by PCA) induced a positive RBL cell response. Successful stimulation of RBL cell degranulation requires not only appropriate epitope densities but also high affinity antibody. These data indicate that this assay is inappropriate for the routine analysis of specific polyclonal IgE antibody responses such as those that are induced by exposure to complex protein allergens.",M4
15209365,"Inhibition of mast cell-dependent allergy reaction by extract of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa).Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) has been used as therapeutics for pain and inflammation in Korean folk medicine. The potential effects of black cohosh extract (BCE) on mast cell-dependent allergy reaction, however, have not been well elucidated yet. In the present study, we investigated the effect of BCE on the allergy reaction using mast cell-dependent in vivo and in vitro models. BCE showed no potential of skin sensitization in local lymph node assay (LLNA). The oral administration of BCE significantly inhibited the anti-IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction. BCE also showed inhibitory potential on the compound 48/80-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. In addition, BCE inhibited the IL-4, IL-5 and TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA and A23187 in human leukemia mast cells, HMC-1. These results demonstrated that BCE has an anti-allergic potential and it may be due to the inhibition of histamine release and cytokine gene expression in the mast cells.",M4
15240993,"Antiallergic activity of hesperidin is activated by intestinal microflora.When hesperidin isolated from pericarpium of Citrus unshiu (family Rutaceae) was incubated with human intestinal microflora, its main metabolite was hesperetin, which was a main metabolite in urine of orally hesperidin-administered rats. The antiallergic activity of hesperidin and its metabolite hesperetin were investigated. Hesperidin did not inhibit the histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE. However, its metabolite hesperetin potently inhibited the histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells induced by IgE and the <e>PCA</e> reaction. The inhibitory activity of hesperetin was found to be comparable with azelastine, a commercially available antiallergic drug, and to potently inhibit prostaglandin E2 production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Hesperetin weakly inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme activities. These results suggest that hesperidin may be a prodrug, which is metabolized to hesperetin by intestinal bacteria.",M4
15124255,"Immunogenicity of hylan g-f 20 in Guinea pigs and mice.OBJECTIVE: To determine the product-specific immunogenicity of a chemically-modified sodium hyaluronate derivative, hylan G-F 20, that is used in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. METHODS: Guinea pigs were subcutaneously immunized with hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) once a week for 3 weeks. After resting, these animals received an intradermal challenge with hylan to elicit allergic skin reactions. Animal sera were tested for the presence of hylan-specific antibodies by homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) assay and of anti-hylan IgG by ELISA. Further, mice were similarly immunized with hylan, and their sera were analyzed by heterologous PCA assay in rats and by ELISA for anti-hylan Ig(G+M) and anti-hylan IgE. RESULTS: In the guinea pig studies, acute and delayed erythematous skin reactions were elicited in immunized animals after the intradermal challenge with hylan. The sera of hylan-immunized guinea pigs showed positive reaction in the homologous PCA assay and significantly high amount of anti-hylan IgG, whereas the sera did not show any cross-reactivity against sodium hyaluronate. Hylan also exhibited immunogenicity in mice of 3 inbred strains, and C3H/HeN mice showed higher production of anti-hylan antibodies than Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSION: Hylan G-F 20 exhibited immunogenicity in guinea pigs and mice. Recent reported severe acute inflammatory reactions in human patients after repeated intraarticular injections of hylan G-F 20 might involve product-specific, immune-mediated mechanisms.",M4
15206583,"Studies on experimental iodine allergy: 3. Low molecular weight elicitogenic antigens of iodine allergy.We hypothesize that iodine allergy is an immune response to iodinated self proteins produced in vivo from various iodine-containing chemicals. Since an antigenic determinant of experimental iodine allergy is diiodotyrosine (DIT), we designed low molecular weight DIT derivatives having provocative antigenicity without sensitizing immunogenicity. Tetraiododityrosine and hexaiodotrityrosine provoked dose-dependent skin reactions in guinea pigs previously immunized with iodine. No guinea pigs immunized with hexaiodotrityrosine showed anaphylactic reaction by i.v. challenge with hexaiodotrityrosine and none of their antisera showed positive passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction in guinea pigs, indicating the non-immunogenic nature of the compound. Erythrosine, one of the color additives having a structure common with DIT, was assessed for its immunological property. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition studies on erythrosine revealed that the inhibitory activity of erythrosine was stronger than that of DIT. Furthermore, erythrosine provoked a PCA reaction in animals sensitized with anti-iodine antisera. In conclusion, hexaiodotrityrosine is thought to be useful for skin testing of iodine allergy without any fear of sensitization to the allergen. Erythrosine was shown to provoke an experimental iodine allergy and, also, the relationships between the new concept of iodine allergy and features of clinical findings of adverse effects by iodocontrast media are discussed.",M4
15098481,"[Determination of protein allergenicity--BN rat model]OBJECTIVE: Protein allergenicity was investigated in BN rat model. METHODS: OVA or BSA was administered i.p. (1 mg/ml) or orally (10 mg/ml) to male BN rats for 6 weeks. In different intervals, blood samples were obtained from the orbital plexus for <e>PCA</e> and histamine determination. In addition, blood pressure of rats in OVA-treated group and control group was measured. RESULTS: Relatively high titres (1/32-1/128) IgE responses were provoked by administration of OVA, while BSA stimulated only low titres (1/2-1/4) IgE. Compared with the controls, the plasma histamine concentrations of OVA groups were higher. An oral challenge with OVA did not induce a clear effect on blood pressure in the majority of rats. However, two rats demonstrated a temporary drop in blood pressure. CONCLUSION: BN rat model may be a suitable animal model to determine protein allergenicity.",M4

Deoxypodophyllotoxin was tested in a rat <e>PCA</e> (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) assay by administering deoxypodophyllotoxin intraperitoneally (1.0 to 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and intravenously (0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.). Deoxypodophyllotoxin dose-dependently inhibited the PCA reaction activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE. The PCA inhibitory activity of deoxypodophyllotoxin was stronger than those of prednisolone and indomethacin, which were used as positive controls. These results suggest that deoxypodophyllotoxin may be beneficial in regulating the immediate-type allergic reaction.",M4
12813625,"Characteristics of the antihistamine effect of TAK-427, a novel imidazopyridazine derivative.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The characteristics of the antihistamine effect of the new antiallergic compound TAK-427 were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro binding assay of [(3)H] pyrilamine was performed using recombinant human histamine H(1) receptors (rhH(1)R). In vivo studies were performed in male ICR mice or Hartley guinea pigs. Drugs were administered orally 1 h before examinations. Determinations were made of histamine-induced skin reaction, ex vivo measured radioligand binding to brain and lung H(1) receptors, pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction, and antigen-induced itch-scratch responses (ISRs). RESULTS: TAK-427 inhibited ligand binding to rhH(1)R with an IC(50) value of 17.3 nmol/l. TAK-427 inhibited histamine-induced skin reactions in guinea pigs and mice with an ID(50) value of 0.884 and 0.450 mg/kg, p.o., respectively; significant inhibition associated with 10 mg/kg of TAK-427 was still observed 24 h after dosing in guinea pigs. TAK-427 showed as high selectivity for peripheral H(1) receptors as terfenadine and epinastine did, which was evaluated by ex vivo measured radioligand binding. Even at 300 mg/kg, TAK-427 did not affect pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice. TAK-427 significantly inhibited PCA in mice and guinea pigs, and also inhibited antigen-induced ISRs in guinea pigs.

Meyer, Araliaceae) has been reported to possess various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antitumor actions. In this study, we investigated the antiallergic activity of ginsenosides isolated from ginseng. METHOD: We isolated ginsenosides by silica gel column chromatography and examined their in vitro and in vivo antiallergic effect on rat peritoneal mast cells and on IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in mice. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of ginsenoside Rh1 (Rh1) in RAW264.7 cells was investigated. RESULTS: Rh1 potently inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells and the IgE-mediated PCA reaction in mice. The inhibitory activity of Rh1 (87% inhibition at 25 mg/kg) on the PCA reaction was found to be more potent than that of disodium cromoglycate (31% inhibition at 25 mg/kg); Rh1 was also found to have a membrane-stabilizing action as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry. It also inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells, and the activation of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, in nuclear fractions. CONCLUSION: The antiallergic action of Rh1 may originate from its cell membrane-stabilizing and anti-inflammatory activities, and can improve the inflammation caused by allergies.",M4
12672153,"Anti-allergic effect of Perilla frutescens and its active constituents.The leaves of Perilla frutescens Britton (Labiatae) are one of the most popular garnishes in Japan, used as an antidote for fi sh and crab meat allergy or as a food colorant. The present study was conducted to evaluate its anti-allergic effect and to identify its active constituents using mice ear-passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>)-reaction. 48 h after the cutaneous injection of anti-ovalbumin serum into the ears of mice, ovalbumin and evansblue dye were intravenously injected. Perilla was extracted with boiling water, and intraperitoneally injected 15 min before ovalbumin-treatment. Thirty min after ovalbumin-treatment, the ears were removed and the colorant in the ear was colorimetrically quantitated. Perilla extract significantly suppressed the PCA-reaction, which was brought about by rosmarinic acid with a partial contribution from some macromolecular compounds. The anti-allergic titer of rosmarinic acid was more effective than tranilast, which is a modern anti-allergic drug. Perilla and rosmarinic acid are potentially promising agents for the treatment of allergic diseases.",M4
12784918,"Inhibition of immunologic and nonimmunologic stimulation-mediated anaphylactic reactions by the aqueous extract of Mentha arvensis.The effect of aqueous extract of Mentha arvensis L. var. piperascens Malinv. (Labiatae) (MAAE) on immunologic and nonimmunologic stimulation-mediated anaphylactic reactions was studied. Nonimmunologic anaphylactic reaction was induced by compound 48/80 injection. MAAE (0.005 to 0.5 g/kg) inhibited systemic anaphylactic reaction induced by compound 48/80. Immunologic anaphylactic reaction was generated by sensitizing the skin with anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE followed 48 h later with an injection of antigen. MAAE (0.001 to 1 g/kg) dose-dependently inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) when intraperitoneally, intraveneously and orally administered. MAAE (0.001 to 1 mg/ml) dose-dependently inhibited the histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) activated by compound 48/80 or anti-DNP IgE. Moreover, MAAE (0.1 mg/ml) had a significant inhibitory effect on anti-DNP IgE-mediated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production. These results indicate that MAAE inhibits immunologic and nonimmunologic stimulation-mediated anaphylactic reactions and TNF-alpha production from RPMC.",M4
12641656,"Brown Norway rat ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin E antibodies increase the human basophil expression of CD63 marker.Anaphylactic shock is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent hypersensitivity. Biological tests like leucocyte histamine release (LHR) and human basophil activation (HBA), frequently used in human allergy, reflect both the amount of IgE fixed on cells and the cellular reactivity. To assess whether serum-specific IgE from Brown Norway (BN) rats prepared for ovalbumin (OVA)-induced anaphylactic shocks can activate human basophils which has a potential interest in experimental allergy: such a test could rapidly assert an IgE sensitization in laboratory animals genetically T-helper 2 (Th2)-predisposed. Rats (n = 39) were immunized three times (day 0, day 5 and day 21) with OVA injected subcutaneously. One week after the third immunization, a shock was induced with an intravenous (i.v.) bolus of OVA. Sensitization was assessed by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) test and dosages of serum IgE antibodies anti-OVA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood basophils were counted before and during the shock. Before the shock induction (at day 21), an LHR test was performed on rat blood, and human basophils were sensitized with rat sera. HBA was demonstrated by the increase in the percentage of cells expressing CD63 antigen membrane, measured by flow cytometry. Twenty-one days after the first subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization, the rat serum induced a significant HBA. HBA was observed neither with the same serum previously heated nor with the serum from nonimmunized rats (NIRs). OVA-specific IgEs were significantly increased in immunized rat (IR) serum. The PCA test was negative when the serum was previously heated (56 degrees C). We never observed any circulating basophils, and LHR test was negative. After OVA i.v. administration, all IRs died rapidly. HBA testing strongly suggests a mediation by specific IgE in the increase of CD63 in BN rats. Thus, HBA test seems useful in assessing whether an experimental allergy was induced in animals genetically predisposed to an immune response, Th2-mediated, like BN rat. We also conclude that rat basophil activation does not participate in the histamine release during anaphylactic shock in sensitized BN rats.",M4
12667673,"An ELISA-based method for measurement of food-specific IgE antibody in mouse serum: an alternative to the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay.Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) assay has been a gold standard method to measure allergen-specific IgE antibody (ASIgE Ab) levels in allergy mouse models. Many factors including stringent guidelines for laboratory animal use make PCA a difficult choice. Therefore, alternative methods are needed that can be readily applied for measurement of specific IgE antibody levels in mouse serum. Herein we describe a novel ELISA-based method that is more sensitive in comparison to PCA, IgE isotype-specific (because it has little cross-reactivity with IgG1 or IgG2a isotype) and highly reproducible (&lt;10% inter- or intra-assay variation). Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this assay to measure specific IgE Ab against a variety of food extracts including chicken egg, peanut, almond, filbert/hazelnut and sweet potato. These findings are of particular interest to those who are seeking (i) to measure food-extract-specific IgE antibody in animal models and (ii) an alternative to the animal-based PCA method to measure mouse IgE antibodies.",M4
12419650,"Effect of Sinpo-Tang on the mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reactions.The herbal formulation Sinpo-Tang (SPT) has long been used for various allergic diseases. We investigated the effect of SPT on the mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reactions in vivo and in vitro murine models. SPT dose dependently inhibited compound 48/80-induced ear swelling response and histamine release. SPT (0.001-0.1g/kg) significantly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>). The mast cell number was markedly decreased at the SPT-treated PCA site. In addition, SPT decreased intracellular calcium levels of activated mast cells. These results suggest that SPT inhibit the anaphylactic degranulation of mast cells through decrease of the intracellular calcium level.",M4
12538043,"Anti-allergic action of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) grain extract.The anti-allergic action of buckwheat grain extract (BGE) was investigated using rodent experimental models. The oral, intraperitoneal and intradermal administration of BGE significantly inhibited the compound 48/80-induced vascular permeability documented by Evans blue extravasation. In addition, BGE showed potent inhibitory effect on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE when orally administered. In an in vitro study, BGE revealed to possess inhibitory potential on the compound 48/80-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC). Moreover, BGE inhibited the IL-4 and TNF-alpha mRNA induction by PMA and A23187 in human leukemia mast cells, HMC-1. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-allergic action of BGE may be due to the inhibition of histamine release and cytokine gene expression in the mast cells.",M4
12115653,"Plasma extravasation induced by dietary supplemented histamine in histamine-free mice.Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) synthesizes endogenous histamine from histidine in mammals. To evaluate the role of histamine in skin allergic reaction, we used HDC gene knockout mice lacking histamine. No plasma extravasation reaction was observed in HDC-/- mice after passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) test. Compound 48/80, a mast cell granule depletor, produced plasma extravasation inHDC+/+ mice but no extravasation in HDC-/- mice. Interestingly, orally administered histamine was distributed in the skin in HDC-/- mice and in these histamine-supplemented mice the plasma extravasation reaction was observed after the injection of compound 48/80 and the PCA test. Cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells of HDC-/- mice took up histamine from the histamine-supplemented medium into the secretory granules. The absorbed histamine was released in response to the same antigen and antibody combination used as in PCA test. In contrast to the immediate-type response, the delayed-type hypersensitive response, observed as a thickening of the ear skin after trinitrochlorobenzene challenge (following sensitization), showed no differences between HDC+/+ and HDC-/- mice. Therefore, among the allergic skin reactions, histamine is revealed to be an important mediator especially for the plasma extravasation in an immediate-type allergy model.",M4
12214867,"Antithrombotic and antiallergic activities of rhaponticin from Rhei Rhizoma are activated by human intestinal bacteria.To evaluate the antithrombotic and antiallergic properties of rhaponticin extracted from Rhei Rhizoma, the in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory activities of rhaponticin and its metabolite, rhapontigenin, were measured. These compounds inhibited in vitro ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Rhapontigenin was more potent, with IC50 values of 4 and 70 microg/ml, respectively. In ex vivo ADP- and collagen-induced rat platelet aggregation, these compounds also exhibited a potent inhibitory effect. The antiplatelet aggregation effects of rhaponticin and rhapontigenin were more potent than those of aspirin. Rhapontigenin showed significant protection from death due to pulmonary thrombosis in mice. Rhapontigenin also showed the strongest inhibitory activity against beta-hexosaminidase release induced by DNP-BSA. These compounds inhibited <e>PCA</e> reaction in mice. Rhapontigenin intraperitoneally administered showed the strongest inhibitory activity and significantly inhibited PCA at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg, with inhibitory activities of 48 and 85%, respectively. The inhibitory activity of orally administered rhaponticin was stronger than that of intraperitoneally administered rhaponticin. These results suggest that rhaponticin, in the rhizome of Rhei Rhizoma, is a prodrug that has extensive antiallergic and antithrombotic properties.",M4
12066855,"Inhibition of immediate-type allergic reactions by the aqueous extract of Salvia plebeia.The effect of aqueous extract of Salvia plebeia R. Brown (Labiatae) (SPAE) on the mast cell mediated immediate-type allergic reactions in rats was studied. SPAE (0.05 to 1 g/kg) inhibited systemic allergic reaction induced by compound 48/80. SPAE (0.001 and 1 g/kg) dose-dependently inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) when intraperitoneally, intraveneously or orally administered. When SPAE was pretreated at the same concentrations with systemic allergic reaction test, the plasma histamine levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. SPAE (0.001 to 1 mg/mL) dose-dependently inhibited the histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) activated by compound 48/80 or anti-DNP IgE. The level of cyclic AMP in RPMC, when SPAE (0.1 and 1 mg/mL) was added, significantly increased compared with that of basal cells. Moreover, SPAE (0.01 to 1 mg/mL) had a significant inhibitory effect on anti-DNP IgE-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production. These results indicate that SPAE may possess strong antiallergic activity and suggest that differences in bioavailability may cause differential activity following different administration routes.",M4

11938956,"[Evaluation of penicilloyl proteins of allergic impurity in gene engineering drugs]It is well known that penicillins are necessary for prevention of contamination during cell culture or fermentation in the production of gene engineering drugs. As penicillins are easily combined with proteins forming allergic impurities, the benzyl penicilloyl proteins in aqueous solution, an evaluation system should be established for control of the gene engineering drugs. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with high specificity and high sensitivity in vitro, by which the conjugated penicillins of 0.3 ppm in a sample could be detected and a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) test, a classical method for evaluation of allergic reaction in vivo are integral parts of this system. Some domestic gene engineering drugs such as erythropoietin (EPO), G-CSF, GM-CSF and 125SerIL-2 are evaluated with this system. No matter whether the expression products was produced in secretion manner or in inclusion body, it was possible that some residues of allergic impurities may remain in the finished products if an unsuitable process of isolation and purification was used. The maximum absolute content of the conjugated penicillins in a sample was up to about one per thousand.",M4
12016597,"Preemptive analgesia: no relevant advantage of preoperative compared with postoperative intravenous administration of morphine, ketamine, and clonidine in patients undergoing transperitoneal tumor nephrectomy.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preemptive analgesia often failed in the clinical arena because application of a single intravenously applied drug may not prevent nociceptive input and spinal pain processing sufficiently. We therefore used an intravenous (IV), multireceptor approach and tested the preemptive analgesic effect of the antinociceptive drugs morphine, ketamine, and clonidine given before or immediately after surgery. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, prospective study was performed in 30 patients undergoing transperitoneal tumor nephrectomy (via median laparotomy). Standard general anesthesia procedure without opioids was used. After induction, patients were randomly allocated to receive 150 microg x kg(-1) of morphine, 150 microg x kg(-1) of ketamine, and 5 microg x kg(-1) of clonidine intravenously via a motor-driven pump within 15 minutes, either before or immediately after surgery. Patient-controlled analgesia (<e>PCA</e>) with the opioid piritramide (IV) was used for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative pain at rest and during induced cough was quantified by analgesic requirement and pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS]) within 48 hours. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in analgesic requirement of piritramide and pain scores at rest or during induced cough. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to encouraging observations on the combination of antinociceptive drugs, the multireceptor approach tested here failed to exert a clinically relevant effect.",M4
11718700,"Promoted expression of mast cell-specific proteases in IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis responses.BACKGROUND: Various factors can influence the protease expression phenotype of mast cells. METHODS: In an effort to understand the potential role of the mast cell proteases in the IgE-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) responses of murine tissues, we studied the changes of proteases expression. The expressions of proteases were examined by Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Promoted expression phenotypes of mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-4, and rat mast cell protease I were accompanied by initiation of anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE-induced PCA responses, suggesting that the induction of these proteases expression are associated with IgE-mediated anaphylaxis responses. Elevated level of the L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA expression was also observed in the PCA tissues and the activated mast cells, compared with that of the corresponding control tissue and cells, due to the activation of mast cells. CONCLUSIONS: Promoted protease expression phenotype appears to be linked with the induction of HDC expression.",M4
11831367,"Antiallergic/antiasthmatic effect of novel antiallergic hexapeptide-95/220 in various experimental models.The effects of newly synthesized antiallergic hexapeptide 95/220 was investigated on various allergic and asthmatic test models. This newly developed peptide was found to be more potent than clinically used drug disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). Hexapeptide 95/220 inhibited immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) and mast cell degranulation in rats, antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in actively sensitized guinea pigs in dose dependent manner like DSCG. Antigen-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum was also markedly inhibited by this newly developed hexapeptide in the same fashion as ketotifen and DSCG did but at comparatively lower dose. Egg albumin-induced histamine release was also blocked by this hexapeptide from chopped lung tissues of sensitized guinea pigs. These results suggest that hexapeptide' 95/220 has potent inhibitory effect on immediate hypersensitivity reactions thereby inhibiting mediator release from mast cell. Moreover, this newly synthesized peptide is orally active and effective at lower doses as compared to standard drugs.",M4
11435731,"Recombinant Dirofilaria immitis-derived antigen can suppress passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions.BACKGROUND: High levels of antigen-nonspecific IgE are produced in animals infected with helminth parasites. Generally, the increase in IgE is thought to exacerbate allergic reactions. However, high levels of antigen-nonspecific IgE may alter some features of anaphylactic reactions. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of antigen-nonspecific IgE production induced during filarial infections, we previously constructed rDiAg (recombinant Dirofilaria immitis-derived antigen) in Escherichia coli. In the present study, we examined the effect of rDiAg on the production of antigen-nonspecific IgE and on allergic cutaneous reactions in rats. METHODS: Osmotic pumps filled with 200 microg of rDiAg or with 200 microl of PBS (control) were subcutaneously implanted in Wistar rats, and plasma samples were collected weekly thereafter. IgE levels were determined by ELISA. Homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reactions with anti-DNP-As IgE were examined 21 days after implantation. (125)I-IgE binding assays were examined on peritoneal mast cells from rDiAg-infused rats and control rats. RESULTS: Antigen-nonspecific IgE production was induced in rDiAg-infused rats. PCA reactions were suppressed in rDiAg-infused rats in spite of high levels of IgE and a markedly increased expression of Fc epsilon RI. (125)I-IgE did not bind to mast cells derived from rDiAg-infused rats, but it bound dose dependently to mast cells derived from control rats. CONCLUSION: The present data support the hypothesis that antigen-nonspecific IgE might protect against antigen-specific IgE by means of competition for mast cell receptors. rDiAg is an essential factor to induce antigen-nonspecific IgE in helminth infections.",M4
11642335,"Effect of oral treatment of Perilla frutescens and its constituents on type-I allergy in mice.Perilla frutescens Britton (perilla, Labiatae) is a medicinal herb prescribed in Saiboku-to [Japanese letters: see text], which is a Kampo formula effective for allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma. The present study was conducted to evaluate the anti-allergic effect of orally administered perilla decoction and to identify the active constituents using mice ear-passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>)-reaction, which is one of the animal models for type I allergy. Perilla decoction significantly suppressed PCA-reaction, and the inhibition % at the dose of 500 mg/kg was 43%. The perilla decoction contains 5.3% of luteolin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--&gt;1)beta-glucuronide], 1.6% of apigenin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--&gt;1)beta-glucuronide], 0.49% of scutellarin, and 2.5% of rosmarinic acid (weight of compound/dried weight of perilla decoction %), respectively. When these constituents were orally administered to mice at the dose equivalent to 500 mg/kg of perilla decoction, rosmarinic acid and apigenin 7-O-[beta-glucuronosyl(2--&gt;1)beta-glucuronide] significantly suppressed PCA-reaction, and their inhibition % was 41% (p&lt;0.01) and 32% (p&lt;0.05), respectively. Since the inhibition % or perilla decoction and rosmarinic acid were nearly equal, the anti-allergic effect of perilla decoction depends primarily on rosmarinic acid. The standard Saiboku-to decoction contained 0.013% of rosmarinic acid, which was too low to exhibit anti-allergic activity in a daily dose of Saiboku-to in adults, suggesting that perilla would be prescribed in Saiboku-to to exhibit other pharmacological effects than its anti-allergic activity, such as a sedative.",M4
11400315,"[Immunological properties of S-1090, cefmatilen hydrochloride hydrate]S-1090, a cefmatilen hydrochloride hydrate, is being developed as a cephalosporin antibiotic for oral use. Immunogenicity, hypersensitivity-eliciting antigenicity and immunological cross-reactivity with other antibiotics were evaluated by active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) test, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using guinea pigs and mice/rats. In addition, in vitro direct Coombs' test was also performed to examine the possibility of hemolytic anemia in clinical use. Immunogenicity of S-1090 was not observed in guinea pigs after repeated immunization with S-1090 by ASA or PCA tests. Even in ELISA, only weak antibody production against S-1090 was found in some guinea pigs from the intraperitoneal groups showing the antibody titers only 10(1) to 10(2). When the sera collected from C3H/He mice and C57BL/6J mice immunized with S-1090 were tested for immunogenicity, rat PCA was elicited in a C3H/He mouse serum by S-1090 and antibodies against S-1090 were detected in a C57BL/6J mouse serum by ELISA. When adjuvant was used in mice and guinea pigs, the production of antibody against S-1090 was less frequent in comparison with other antibiotics such as cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefotiam (CTM). When hypersensitivity-eliciting antigenicity of S-1090 was examined using S-1090 as an eliciting antigen in ASA and PCA tests, positive ASA and PCA were observed in guinea pigs and positive PCA in a C3H/He mouse. Hypersensitivity-eliciting antigenicity was also observed in other reference antibiotics, i.e. cephalothin (CET), CMZ and CTM. Immunological cross-reactivity among S-1090, penicillin G (PCG), CET, CMZ and CTM was tested by ASA and PCA tests. S-1090 was found to immunologically cross-react only with CET in guinea pigs. In the present study, immunological cross-reactivities were also noted between PCG and CET, PCG and CMZ, PCG and CTM, and between CET and CMZ. In in vitro direct Coombs' test using human red blood cells, S-1090.Na, PCG and CET gave positive reactions at the final concentrations of 40 mg/mL, 20 to 40 mg/mL and 2.5 to 10 mg/mL, respectively.",M4

VUF-K-8788 inhibited [3H]-mepyramine from binding to the cell membrane of lung parenchyma (Ki value: 5.0 nM) and the histamine-induced contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum (pA2: 9.71) without affecting ileal contractions induced by acetylcholine, serotonin, KCl and BaCl2. The increase of vascular permeabilities induced by histamine and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in guinea pigs were inhibited by VUF-K-8788 in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50: 0.24 and 0.26 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). Moreover, the anti-histaminic effect of VUF-K-8788 was also observed in rats. In experiments on the effects on the central nervous system, VUF-K-8788 at 1 mg/kg, p.o. hardly antagonized the H1 receptor at all in the cerebral cortex of guinea pigs. VUF-K-8788 inhibited the PCA-induced scratching behavior completely without affecting thiopental-induced sleep in mice. These results suggested that VUF-K-8788 would be useful in the treatment of allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis and eczema.",M4
11282390,"A comparative study on cockroach and ovalbumin sensitizations and challenge responses in Hartley guinea-pigs.The role of allergens in asthmatic inflammation is not clearly understood. To elucidate the mechanism of cockroach allergen (CRa)-induced airway disease, we studied three groups of Hartley guinea-pigs sensitized to control, ovalbumin (OA) or CRa. Parameters measured were anaphylactic antibodies by allergy skin test (AST), <e>PCA</e> assay and Western blot, changes in specific airway resistance (SRaw), analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and contracture responses of tracheal muscle (TSM) to non-specific and specific stimuli, in vitro. Both OA and CRa animals showed a similar allergic sensitization (AST and PCA), while Western blot identified several reaginic bands in CRa group compared to a single band in OA group. SRaw illustrated that CRa induce dual-asthmatic responses (4/6) in the CRa group, whereas OA induce only an early asthmatic response (3/6) in the OA group (P&lt;0.01). The average total leukocytes in BALF of the CRa were 27.0x10(6), mostly neutrophils and eosinophils, while those of the OA showed 3.5x10(6), mostly eosinophils, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). TSM responses to non-specific stimuli were similar in both groups (P&gt;0.1), while the antigen-specific TSM contractions were more brisk in the OA group than those of CRa group (P&lt;0.001). Thus, the study indicates that both CRa and OA sensitize guinea-pigs, yet CRa induces more severe and persistent late-phase inflammation than OA. This appears to be related to an influx of neutrophils rather than anaphylactic bronchospasm.",M4
11341401,"Role of histamine in heartworm extract-induced shock in dogs.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether heartworm (HW) extract-induced shock in dogs is consistent with anaphylactic shock by examining the role of histamine. ANIMALS: 6 mixed-breed dogs (3 without and 3 with HW infections) and 4 specific pathogen-free (SPF) Beagles. PROCEDURE: Four experiments were performed as follows: 1) 6 mixed-breed dogs were treated IV with 2 ml of HW extract, and plasma histamine concentrations were determined; 2) 4 SPF dogs were treated IV with 2 ml of HW extract and examined for shock; 3) sera from 6 dogs of experiment 1 and from 4 SPF dogs of experiment 2 that were obtained before HW extract treatment were tested for heterologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>), using rabbits during a sensitization period of 48 to 72 hours; and 4) mast cell degranulation by HW extract was tested, using rat mesentery and canine cultured mast cells. RESULTS: Experiment 1: 6 dogs developed shock, and plasma histamine concentrations increased significantly from 0.3 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SD) ng/ml before HW extract treatment to 44.6 +/- 68.9 ng/ml at the onset of shock; experiment 2: all SPF dogs developed shock and had an increase in plasma histamine concentrations; experiment 3: sera from mixed-breed dogs without HW infection and from SPF dogs had negative PCA reactions; experiment 4: HW extract degranulated rat mesentery mast cells and released histamine directly from canine mast cells. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of our study indicate that an unknown mast cell-degranulating substances contained in HW extract may degranulate mast cells directly, consequently releasing histamine that may participate in the onset of shock in HW extract-induced shock in dogs.",M4
11248853,"[Mediator release assay of rat basophil leukemia cells as alternative for passive cutaneous anaphylaxis testing (<e>PCA</e>) in laboratory animals]Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) is an animal model for inflammatory reactions in Type I allergy. An in vitro assay based on IgE dependent and allergen-induced mediator release of RBL-2H3 cells is presented as an alternative for PCA. The assay has been adopted to the special needs of examining allergen extracts and has been proven to be practicable and reliable. A high number of samples can be processed quickly in one assay, with intra-assay variations below 10%. The first successful applications are the measurement of biologic potencies in allergenic extracts and the determination of murine serum IgE antibodies. Further studies will show whether this assay is suited to evaluate the efficiency of anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic drugs.",M4

Anti-allergic effects of stilbene components from Rhei undulati Rhizoma (dried rhizome of Rheum undulatum cultivated in Korea).Methanol extract (RM-ext) obtained from the dried rhizome of Rheum undulatum was screened for activity in experimental models of type I allergy. RM-ext exhibited the inhibition on 48-h homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rats and an antigen-induced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Among nine stilbenes isolated from RM-ext, seven inhibited the histamine release. Rhapontigenin (compound 1), piceatannol (2) and piceatannol 3'-beta-D-glycoside (6) with oral administration showed the inhibition on PCA. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited the inhibitory effect on sheep red blood cell-induced delayed-type hyper sensitivity (SRBC-DTH) of type IV allergic model. These results indicated that the rhizome of Rheum undulatum inhibits the allergic reactions and that these inhibitory effects may be partially attributable to the stilbenes mentioned above.",M4
11146395,"Inhibition of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-associated scratching behavior by mu-opioid receptor antagonists in ICR mice.BACKGROUND: Itching in humans is attenuated by mu-opioid receptor antagonists. ICR mice display increases in scratching behavior upon induction of IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>), or intradermal injection of compound 48/80 or histamine. METHODS: Cutaneous reactions were induced in ICR mice by IgE-mediated PCA, compound 48/80 and histamine, and the scratching behavior associated with the cutaneous reactions was evaluated. RESULTS: Naloxone and nalmefene reduced the incidence of scratching behavior associated with PCA. Naloxone also inhibited the induction of scratching behavior caused by compound 48/80 and histamine. Naloxone did not affect the increase in vascular permeability caused by PCA and injection of compound 48/80. CONCLUSION: Scratching behavior in mice may be induced by a sensation or a mechanism similar to itching in humans and should become a useful model for examining itching in humans.",M4
11211923,"Oral beta-stimulants can inhibit passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats through an indirect inhibitory mechanism: possible involvement of afferent and efferent nervous system via gastric beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We previously demonstrated that oral l-ephedrine exerts an extremely rapid (within 20 s) inhibition of 48-h passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction (<e>PCA</e>) in rats by a possibly unidentified mode of action. In the present experiments, we elucidated the mechanism of the PCA inhibition by l-ephedrine using adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. MATERIALS: Rat antiserum was prepared with dinitrophenylated Ascaris suum extract + Bordetella pertussis. TREATMENT: Passively skin-sensitised Wistar rats were mainly used. l-Ephedrine, and adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists were orally administered immediately before PCA provocation. Catecholamine depleting (6-hydroxydopamine, 6-OHDA), amine depleting (reserpine) or ganglion blocking (hexamethonium) agent was intraperitoneally or intravenously administered before the provocation. METHODS: The effects of the drugs on PCA were assessed by inhibition of the dye leakage. RESULTS: beta-(propranolol) and beta2-(butoxamine) blocking agents reduced the inhibition of PCA by l-ephedrine, while the inhibition was not altered by either an a-blocking agent (phentolamine) or a beta1-(atenolol) selective antagonist. On the other hand, beta-(isoproterenol) and beta2-selective (salbutamol) agonists showed extremely rapid inhibition of PCA. However, the beta-selective agonist (dobutamine) had no effect on the reaction. The pretreatment with hexamethonium, reserpine or 6-OH-DA substantially attenuated the inhibitory effect of l-ephedrine on PCA. CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly suggest that beta2-adrenoceptors locate in the stomach and that their receptor excitement finally may lead to the inhibition of PCA via the stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems.",M4
11089909,"Immediate inhibition by oral l-ephedrine of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis of rats: indirect inhibition of anaphylactic chemical mediator release from the mast cell.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We previously reported that oral l-ephedrine showed extraordinarily rapid inhibition of 48-h passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rats. In the present study, in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to elucidate a possible mechanism for the inhibition. MATERIALS: Rat antiserum was prepared with dinitrophenylated Ascaris suum extract + Bordetella pertussis. TREATMENT: Wistar rats were passively skin-sensitised, actively sensitised or non-sensitised. l-Ephedrine immediately before provocations was orally or intravenously administered in in vivo experiments. In in vitro experiments, the drug was added at various time and concentrations before the challenge. METHODS: The intensity of PCA was assessed by dye leakage method. Histamine and serotonin released in vitro or retained in the skin in vivo by anaphylaxis were assayed fluorometrically. RESULTS: Oral l-ephedrine rapidly inhibited the PCA by inhibiting the release of histamine and serotonin from the reaction site, whereas anaphylactic histamine and serotonin releases from skin fragments were not affected by the drug. Furthermore, the orally administered drug influenced neither the histamine- nor serotonin-induced cutaneous vascular permeability. CONCLUSIONS: These results were strongly indicative that the prompt suppression of the PCA by oral l-ephedrine was not exerted following the drug was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the result may be from an indirect inhibition of chemical mediator release, possibly through an unidentified stimulation of the nervous system, but not from the inhibition of chemical mediator release by the direct interaction of drug to mast cells and not from the decreased vascular permeability.",M4
11146385,"The multipotential pseudoantigenicity of X-ray contrast media. Pseudoantigen excess may downregulate the release of hypotensive mediators.BACKGROUND: X-ray contrast media (CM) toxicity resembles IgE-antigen-based anaphylaxis, and CM-related histamine release has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. While nobody has succeeded in producing antibodies against injections of neat CM, the ability of CM to compete with a series of antigens against their respective antibodies has recently been demonstrated. However, there is a paradox, since the CM with the strongest antibody binding are nevertheless the least likely to provoke antigen-antibody-related mast cell/basophil release. METHODS: Two strains of rats were subjected to (a) passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) studies in the presence of various concentrations of CM, (b) blood pressure (BP) tracings following bolus administrations of various prototypical CM and (c) BP tracings in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats, challenged with OVA plus CM, vs. OVA plus CM-equivalent saline. RESULTS: In the PCA studies, and the OVA challenge studies, the CM appear to act in an antigen excess mode, limiting the potential of the OVA to elicit anaphylactic changes, as demonstrated by permeability studies or by BP levels. The bolus CM studies demonstrate that the more potent CM 'antigens' actually produce an increase in BP and the less potent CM 'antigens', a drop in BP. These changes can be related to the CM acting in an 'antigen' excess mode vs. an 'antigen' equivalent mode. CONCLUSIONS: The CM have the potential to act in an 'antigen' excess or 'antigen'-equivalent mode. The potential to express an 'antigen'-excess mode in vivo, may be unique to CM because of the high concentrations injected.",M4
10952031,"Suppression of immunoglobulin E-mediated anaphylactic reaction by Alpinia oxyphylla in rats.We investigated the effect of Alpinia oxyphylla water extract (AOWE) on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody. AOWE dose-dependently suppressed passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) when intraperitoneally or orally administered. On the other hand, it showed weak suppressive activity when administered intravenously. AOWE dose-dependently suppressed anaphylactic histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) activated by anti-DNP IgE antibody. However, AOWE had a significant augmenting effect on anti-DNP IgE antibody-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion from RPMC. These results indicated that AOWE may possess strong antianaphylactic action and also suggest that differential activity following administration routes may be caused by difference of bioavailability.",M4
11028756,"l-Ephedrine is a major constituent of Mao-Bushi-Saishin-To, one of the formulas of Chinese medicine, which shows immediate inhibition after oral administration of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Whether Mao-Bushi-Saishin-To (MBST), one of the formulas of classical Chinese medicine, is effective on 48-h passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rats and which substance in the formula is responsible for its inhibitory action were examined. TREATMENT: In the studies on PCA, MBST (hot water extract of the whole herbal formula), extracts of Ephedra herb (Mao), l-ephedrine and other reference drugs were orally administered immediately or at various times before or 5 min after the antigen challenge. In the experiments on anaphylactic histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, l-ephedrine and d-pseudoephedrine were added at 10(-4)-10(-7) g/ml at 30, 10, 3 or 0 min before antigen provocation. RESULTS: The time course study indicated that MBST produced a prompt and long lasting inhibition of PCA. Among the constituents of Mao, l-ephedrine exerted this prompt inhibitory activity, but d-pseudoephedrine did not. Neither pseudoephedrine nor l-ephedrine prevented the anaphylactic histamine release from isolated peritoneal mast cells. CONCLUSIONS: It is strongly emphasised that the rapid suppression of PCA by orally administered l-ephedrine must be exerted by a mechanism distinct from that of suppression produced following gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, because the time required for the inhibition was extraordinarily short. However, direct inhibition of anaphylactic histamine release from isolated mast cells was excluded in this inhibition of PCA.",M4
10850373,"Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies of anthraquinone 2-carboxylic acid on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats.The objectives of this study are to describe the inhibitory effect of 9,10-anthraquinone 2-carboxylic acid (AQCA) on IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction, and the pharmacokinetics of AQCA. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg (i.v.) and 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg (p.o) dose levels. In separate groups, pharmacokinetics were assessed at 5 mg/kg (i.v.) and 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg (p.o.) dose levels. Intravenous and oral administration of AQCA inhibited the PCA reaction in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The PCA-inhibitory activity of AQCA (20 mg/kg) lasted more than 12 hrs after oral administration. The oral bio-availability decreased with increasing dosage, from 96% (5 mg/kg) to 81% (10 and 20 mg/kg). The absorption after oral administration was prolonged with Tmax values ranging from 1 to 6 h; while t(1/2) (4.8-16 h) values appeared to be comparable. These results suggest that AQCA has a potent and long acting anti-PCA activity. It is likely to be therapeutically useful in the treatment of asthma.",M4
10919361,"Metabolism of rhaponticin and chrysophanol 8-o-beta-D-glucopyranoside from the rhizome of rheum undulatum by human intestinal bacteria and their anti-allergic actions.Rhaponticin and chrysophanol 8-o-beta-D-glucopyranoside isolated from the rhizomes of Rheum undulatum (Family Polygonaceae) are metabolized to rhapontigenin and chrysophanol, respectively, by human intestinal microflora. Most intestinal bacteria isolated from human feces catalyzed these metabolic pathways. Among rhaponticin and chrysophanol 8-o-beta-D-glucopyranoside and their metabolites, rhapontigenin had the most potent inhibitory activity on a hyaluronidase, a histamine release from mast cell and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) PCA reaction. The inhibitory activity of rhapontigenin was more potent than that of disodium cromoglycate, one of the commercial anti-allergic drugs. These results suggest that rhaponticin in the rhizomes of R. undulatum is a prodrug that has an extensive anti-allergic property.",M4
10823665,"Experimental allergic conjunctivitis in guinea pigs induced by Japanese cedar pollen.We report a new experimental allergic conjunctivitis with Japanese cedar pollen as antigen in guinea pigs, and the immunological characteristics of this model were also elucidated. Allergic conjunctivitis was developed by immunization in guinea pigs with a mixture containing Japanese cedar pollen and killed Bordetella pertussis. When local application of Japanese cedar pollen suspension 14 d after systemic immunization was performed every 3d, remarkable conjunctivitis was observed from 20 to 35 d. Increase in vascular permeability and decrease in histamine contents of the conjunctiva were also observed after local application of antigen. Passive cutaneous anaphylactic (<e>PCA</e>) reactions revealed that both IgG- and IgE-rich antibodies were produced in this model. Chlorpheniramine, ketotifen and levocabastine were effective in inhibiting cedar pollen-induced conjunctivitis. Although a high concentration was needed, tranilast and amlexanox also showed significant inhibition of conjunctivitis induced by cedar pollen.",M4
10822083,"A new model of allergic rhinitis in rats by topical sensitization and evaluation of H(1)-receptor antagonists.An animal model of chronic allergic rhinitis was developed by repeated local booster sensitization into the nasal cavity in sensitized rats. The severity of allergic rhinitis was assessed by determining the extent of two markers of nasal allergic symptoms (sneezing and nasal rubbing) after antigen challenge. The number of incidents of sneezing and nasal rubbing was markedly increased during intranasal instillation of antigen in sensitized rats. The <e>PCA</e> titers were also markedly elevated by intranasal sensitization. Some histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists such as chlorpheniramine, ketotifen, astemizole and epinastine inhibited the increase in antigen-induced nasal symptoms in a dose-related manner. Nasal rubbing was more potently inhibited by H(1)-receptor antagonists than sneezing. In conclusion, we developed a chronic allergic rhinitis model showing nasal symptoms in rats, and this model may be useful for evaluating the effects of drugs on allergic rhinitis.",M4
10490948,"Cutting edge: mouse IgG1 antibodies comprise two functionally distinct types that are differentially regulated by IL-4 and IL-12.IL-4-dependent and -independent IgG1 Abs differ in their ability to induce mast cell degranulation as measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>). Mice immunized with OVA or PIII (fraction of Ascaris suum) produced high titers of IgG1 as shown by ELISA and PCA. In contrast, another A. suum fraction, PI, elicited IgG1 Abs with no PCA activity. IgG1 with anaphylactic activity required IL-4, as IgG1 responses to OVA and PIII in IL-4-/- mice gave no PCA. PI-specific IgG1 was IL-4-independent, because no difference was found between the responses of IL-4-/- and IL-4+/+ mice. Significant PCA reactions were elicited, however, with PI-specific IgG1 from IL-12-/- or anti-IFN-gamma Ab-treated mice, although less Ab was measured by ELISA. These results indicate that one type of IgG1 has anaphylactic activity and its synthesis is IL-4-dependent, being inhibited by IL-12 or IFN-gamma; the other lacks this activity and its synthesis is stimulated by IL-12 or IFN-gamma.",M4
10664931,"Anaphylactic reaction in experimental malnutrition.We evaluated the effects of malnutrition on the allergic response in male EPM-1 Wistar rats. The animals underwent two dietary regimens from the 21st to the 60th day of life as follows: control animals were fed a normoproteic diet (18% casein) and malnourished animals a hypoproteic diet (4.5% casein). On day 60, some of the animals were sacrificed for determination of total serum protein and albumin levels. In addition, within each subgroup of the remaining animals, some underwent intraperitoneal immunization with ovalbumin in aluminum hydroxide. Thus, four groups of animal were obtained: immunized controls (n = 11); immunized malnourished animals (n = 11); unimmunized controls (n = 7) and unimmunized malnourished rats (n = 8). Fourteen days after sensitization with ovalbumin, the animals were challenged with intravenous ovalbumin in order to induce an anaphylactic reaction, which was evaluated by vascular permeability increase as assessed by the Evans blue dye extravasation method. Extravasation of Evans blue was quantitated in dried gastrointestinal tissues obtained from rats sacrificed 10 min after induction of the anaphylactic reaction. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reactions were also evaluated in the controls and malnourished rats. The adequacy of our model was confirmed by the reduction in weight gain, in food intake, and in total protein and albumin serum levels in malnourished rats as compared to controls at 60 days of life. The anaphylactic reaction induced significant increase in vascular permeability particularly among control animals. PCR results showed significantly lower titers in malnourished animals when their sera were injected into the skin of control animals. In contrast, PCA reactions using sera from immunized control rats to inject into the skin of malnourished rats showed an equally intense reaction as that observed in control animals. Our results suggest that malnourished animals have a normal capacity of releasing inflammatory mediators, and show a normal vascular response after anaphylaxis. The diminished vascular response seen in the gastrointestinal tract in malnourished animals, as compared to controls, may be due to the production of lower levels of IgE antibodies caused by malnutrition.",M4
10420391,"Effects of fujibitol, a remedy for nasal symptoms of immediate and delayed type allergic reactions.The effects of Fujibitol, a remedy for the nasal symptoms of immediate and delayed type allergic reactions were studied. Fujibitol inhibited active systemic anaphylaxis in mice, heterologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) in rats, Masugi's nephritis in rats and delayed type hypersensitivity induced by picryl chloride in mice, but did not affect homologous PCA or immune complex-induced glomerulonephritis in rats.

With the exception of phyllodulcin, these constituents were found to significantly inhibit the PCA reaction. Although thunberginol A showed the most potent inhibitory effect, hydrangenol was considered to be the principal antiallergic component in the processed leaves, after taking into account their contents.",M4
10365318,"Evaluation of antiallergic activity (type I hypersensitivity) of Inula racemosa in rats.Alcoholic extract of root of Inula racemosa, was studied for its antiallergic effect in experimental models of type I hypersensitivity, viz. egg albumin induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) and mast cell degranulation in albino rats. The alcoholic extract was prepared by the process of continuous heat extraction. LD50 of this extract was found to be 2100 +/- 60 mg/kg, i.p. Assessment of protection against egg albumin induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxix by different doses of Inula racemosa was done by giving drug intraperitoneally or orally for seven days or once only. Mast cell degranulation studies were done by using compound 48/80 as degranulation agent with same dosage schedule. Inula racemosa (i.p. as well as p.o.) showed significant protection against egg albumin induced PCA. Protection against compound 48/80 induced mast cell degranulation by alcoholic extract of Inula racemosa (single dose) was similar to that of disodium cromoglycate. The seven days drug treatment schedule showed greater protection than disodium cromoglycate intraperitoneally. The results suggest that Inula racemosa possesses potent antiallergic properties in rats.",M4
10403140,"Anti-allergic actions of the leaves of Castanea crenata and isolation of an active component responsible for the inhibition of mast cell degranulation.The anti-allergic actions of the leaves of Castanea crenata (Fagaceae) were studied. The water extract demonstrated potent anti-allergic actions in in vivo and in vitro experiments. The oral or intraperitoneal administration of the extract (100 or 200 mg/kg) caused a significant inhibition of the 48 hr-<e>PCA</e> (up to 90%) and the vascular permeability induced by histamine or serotonin in rats (about 80%). The anaphylactic release of beta-hexosaminidase from RBL-2H3 cells was also significantly inhibited by the extract in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 230 microg/ml. The activity-guided fractionation of the extract, based on the determination of inhibitory effect upon the release of beta-hexosaminidase, led to the isolation of quercetin as an active principle responsible for the inhibition of degranulation.",M4
10075121,"Effect of Korean folk medicine 'Chung-Dae-San' on mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reaction.We investigated the effect of the herbal formulation 'Chung-Dae-San' (CDS) on anaphylactic reactions. CDS inhibited compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic shock 100% with the dose of 10(0) g/kg body weight (BW). When CDS was given as pretreatment at concentrations ranging from 10(-4) to 10(0) g/kg BW, the serum histamine levels induced by compound 48/80 were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. We also investigated the effect of CDS on mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody. CDS potently inhibited PCA when administered orally, topically, intraperitoneally or intradermally. However, it did not show inhibitory activity when administered intravenously. CDS dose-dependently inhibited the histamine release from the rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) by compound 48/80 and anti-DNP IgE. Moreover, the level of cAMP in RPMC, when CDS was added, significantly increased about 4-fold at 4 min compared with that of basal cells. These results indicate that CDS may possess strong antianaphylactic activity and also suggest the differential activity following administration routes may be caused by difference in bioavailability.",M4
10202043,"Role of TGF-beta 1 on the IgE-dependent anaphylaxis reaction.TGF-beta1 is a member of a family of polypeptide factors that control proliferation, differentiation, chemotaxis, and other functions in many cell types. TGF-beta1 has been shown to inhibit many immunologic functions. However, here we report that TGF-beta1 has an important role in the elicitation of IgE-dependent allergic reactions. The synthetic antisense TGF-beta1 oligonucleotides dose-dependently inhibit passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction and histamine release from the mast cells activated by anti-DNP IgE in rats. The level of cAMP in mast cells, when antisense TGF-beta1 oligonucleotides was added, significantly increased approximately 7-fold compared with that of basal cells. The antisense TGF-beta1 oligonucleotides also had a significant inhibitory effect on anti-DNP IgE-induced TNF-alpha release from mast cells. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the PCA reaction sites treated with antisense TGF-beta1 oligonucleotides exhibited no detectable levels of TGF-beta1 and L-histidine decarboxylase mRNA after anti-DNP IgE stimulation, whereas the PCA reaction sites treated with sense TGF-beta1 oligonucleotides possessed significant amounts of their mRNA. Additionally, neutralizing Ab to TGF-beta1 blocked the PCA reaction significantly, but its Ab did not inhibit peritoneal mast cell-released histamine upon treatment with anti-DNP IgE. Our results suggest that TGF-beta1 is critical to the development of IgE-dependent anaphylaxis reactions.",M4
10069418,"Fc receptor beta subunit is required for full activation of mast cells through Fc receptor engagement.The high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilonRI) and the low-affinity IgG receptor (Fc gammaRIII) on mast cells are the key molecules involved in triggering the allergic reaction. These receptors share the common beta subunit (FcRbeta) which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and transduces the signals of these receptors' aggregation. In rodents, FcRbeta is essential for the cell surface expression of the Fc epsilonRI. In humans, the FcRbeta gene was reported to be one of the candidate genes causing atopic diseases. However, the role of FcRbeta in vivo still remains ambiguous. To elucidate the functions of FcRbeta, we developed the mice lacking FcRbeta [FcRbeta(-/-)]. The FcRbeta(-/-) mice lacked the expression of the Fc epsilonRI on mast cells and IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) was not induced in FcRbeta(-/-) mice as was expected. In these mice, the expression of IgG receptors on mast cells was augmented but the IgG-mediated PCA reaction was attenuated. Although with bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells from FcRbeta(-/-), adhesion to fibronectin and Ca2+ flux upon aggregation of IgG receptors were enhanced, mast cells co-cultured with 3T3 fibroblasts exhibited impaired degranulation on receptor aggregation. These observations indicate that FcRbeta accelerates the degranulation of mature mast cells via the IgG receptor in connective tissues.",M4

Betotastine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and ketotifen (1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited both rat PCA and histamine-induced cutaneous reaction, whereas they showed little effect on serotonin-induced cutaneous reaction. Betotastine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.) and ketotifen (1 mg/kg, p.o. ) significantly inhibited antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs which had been passively sensitized with guinea pig IgE antibody. In actively sensitized guinea pigs, the immediate and late phase increase in airway resistance (Rrs) were observed within 5 min and between 4 and 7 h after the aeroantigen challenge. Betotastine (1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited both responses. Ketotifen (1 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the immediate phase response, but did not affect the late phase response. Exposure of guinea pigs to aerosolized PAF increased the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 24 h after the stimulation. Betotastine (3-10 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently inhibited PAF-induced accumulation of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar cavity. In contrast, cetirizine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a tendency to inhibit eosinophil accumulation, and ketotifen (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and terfenadine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) did not have any affect.

Next, various drugs were tested using the mouse PLNA to study whether PLN reactivity could be related to the potential of the compounds to induce allergic and autoimmune disorders in humans. The parameter of the PLNA was determined by the PLN cellularity index in BALB/c and A/J mice treated with a single subcutaneous injection of compounds. Hartley guinea pigs were immunized subcutaneously with the compounds without adjuvant, and then the GP-PCA and GP-ASA reactions were assessed. The examinations using mice and guinea pigs showed that mouse PLN responses to TNBS, penicillin G and cephalothin correlated with the allergenicity responses obtained in the GP-PCA reaction to three compounds. In the mouse PLNA, ten drugs considered to be well-known inducers of allergic side-effects in humans (i.e., penicillin G, cephalothin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, streptomycin, 4-aminoantipyrine, chlorhexidine and sulfamethoxazole) caused increases in PLN cellularity indices as well.

Derivatives of 2i have also notable or moderate activity in the rat PCA assay. Compound 2h which has no oxygen atom at the alpha-position of the amide carbonyl group and, compound 17 which has no amide carbonyl group, showed no inhibition in the rat PCA assay.

Microvascular permeability in the mesentery and consequent leakage of protein into the peritoneum of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive rats (NTR) was measured in vivo by the extravasation of Evans blue dye. 2. In sensitized NTR, challenge with antigen produced extensive increases in dye extravasation in the mesentery and in peritoneal lavage fluid within 10 min. 3. In sensitized SHR there was no increase in the permeability of the mesentery and a very weak increase in dye extravasation in the peritoneal cavity following challenge. 4. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU38486 did not change the permeability response induced by antigen in sensitized NTR and SHR. 5. However, compound 48/80 was equally effective in either NTR or SHR in causing increased vasopermeability. 6. Mesenteric mast cells in the NTR were degranulated after immunological challenge, whereas those in the SHR were resistant, as measured histologically. 7. Similarly, challenge ex vivo of mesentery from sensitized NTR induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum in co-incubation experiments, whereas SHR mesentery was unresponsive. 8. Plasma levels of antigen-specific IgE and IgG2a in sensitized NTR and SHR were identical. 9. Immune serum from SHR was unable to induce a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reaction in the skin of NTR and SHR did not develop a PCA reaction upon passive sensitization with NTR immune serum. 10. We conclude that the mast cells of SHR are resistant to degranulation following immunological challenge, although the relevant antibodies are present.",M4
9703202,"Inhibition of mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reactions by the pigment of Polygonum tinctorium (Chung-Dae) in rats.1. The effect of the pigment obtained from the stem and leaf of Polygonum tinctorium Loar (PtP) on anaphylactic reactions was studied in rats. 2. PtP totally inhibited compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic shock with doses of 10(2) and 10(3) mg/ kg. When PtP was pretreated at concentrations ranging from 10(-2) to 10(3) mg/kg, the serum histamine levels induced by compound 48/80 were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. 3. We also investigated the effect of PtP on mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody. PtP potently inhibited PCA when administered orally, topically, intraperitoneally and intradermally. However, it did not show inhibitory activity when administered intravenously. 4. PtP inhibited dose dependently histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs) induced by compound 48/80 and anti-DNP IgE. Moreover, the level of cAMP in RPMC, when PtP was added, significantly increased about 12-fold at 4 min compared with that of basal cells. 5. These results indicate that PtP may possess strong antianaphylactic activity and suggest that differences in bioavailability may cause differential activity following different administration routes.",M4
9658385,"Pharmacological activities of khellactones, compounds isolated from Peucedanum japonicum THUNB. and Peucedanum praeruptorium DUNN.The spasmolytic and antiallergic effects of AA and BB, compounds isolated from Peucedanum japonicum THUNB. (P. japonicum THUNB.) and Peucedanum praeruptorium DUNN. (P. praeruptorium DUNN.), were investigated in isolated smooth muscle and rat <e>PCA</e>. AA and BB showed noncompetitive antagonistic effects on Ach- and histamine-induced contraction in the isolated guinea pig ileum. Both AA and BB at 10(-6) g/ml caused a slight shift to the right of the dose-response curve for Ca2+ in isolated guinea pig ileum, and a concentration up to 3 x 10(-6) g/ml displayed noncompetitive antagonistic effects. The Ba2+ (3 x 10(-4) g/ml)-induced contraction in ileum and the histamine (10(-3) g/ml)-induced contraction in trachea were obtained to relaxation by AA and BB in a concentration-dependent fashion. AA and BB showed noncompetitive antagonist action on serotonin-induced contraction of the rat uterus excised 24-48 h after subcutaneous injection of female rats with estradiol. But, AA and BB were found to have hardly any inhibitory effect on rabbit thoracic aorta contractions induced by epinephrine (3 x 10(-6) g/ml). When the effect of oral administration of 40 mg/kg dose of BB was tested on the rat homologous PCA using anti-egg albumin mouse serum dilutions (1:100, 1:250, 1:500 and 1:750), it inhibited the 1:750 serum reaction 42.6%, but the inhibition rates for the other dilutions were 12-20%. Thus, based on the results of testing AA and BB, compounds isolated from P. japonicum THUNB. and P. praeruptorium DUNN. were confirmed to possess a spasmolytic effect on different types of smooth muscle and a mild antiallergic effect. These findings are of interest in regard to the medical uses of P. japonicum THUNB. and P. praeruptorium DUNN. as a herbal drug for bronchial asthma, spasmolytic effect, etc.",M4
9683343,"Suppression of immunoglobulin E-mediated anaphylactic reaction by Hwanglyun-Haedok-Tang water extract.According to traditional Oriental philosophy, Hwanglyun-Haedok-Tang (HH-Tang) is a prescription for heat clearing of the organism. This prescription has been used against allergic diseases for generations, and still occupies an important place in traditional medicine in Korea. In this study, we investigated the effect of HH-Tang water extract on immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated anaphylaxis activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody. HH-Tang water extract potently suppressed passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) when intradermally, intraperitoneally, or orally administered. On the other hand, it showed weak suppressive activity when administered intravenously. HH-Tang water extract, dose-dependently suppressed anaphylactic histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) activated by anti-DNP IgE antibody. Moreover, HH-Tang water extract had a significant suppressive effect on anti-DNP IgE antibody-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion from RPMC. The level of cAMP in RPMC, when HH-Tang water extract was added, significantly increased compared with that of normal control. These results indicate that HH-Tang water extract may possess strong antianaphylactic action and also suggest that differential activity following administration routes may be caused by difference of bioavailability.",M4
9645225,"Drug susceptibility of <e>PCA</e> in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice.Our previous study revealed that passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) can be produced in congenitally mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv (abbreviated as W/Wv) mice on sensitization with undiluted or slightly diluted allogeneic and xenogeneic antisera but not on sensitization with allogeneic monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG1 antibodies regardless of the antibody concentration [1]. In view of these findings, the present study was conducted to characterize PCA in this strain from its drug susceptibilities using mast cell-bearing WBB6F1-(+)/+ (abbreviated as +/+) and B6D2F1 mice as references. PCA in W/Wv mice mediated by a low dilution (1:4) of hyperimmune serum to bovine serum albumin of the B6D2F1 mouse origin was markedly suppressed by CV-6209, an antagonist of platelet-activating factor (PAF), but not by antihistamines such as cyproheptadine and oxatomide. In contrast, PCA in +/+ and B6D2F1 mice mediated by a high dilution (1:128) of the anti-serum (virtually by IgG1 antibody) was nearly completely suppressed by antihistamines but not by CV-6209. A remarkable difference between PCA in W/Wv and reference mice was also observed in the susceptibility to monoclonal anti-mouse granulocyte (Gr-1) antibody: PCA in W/Wv mice was potently suppressed by the 1- to 3-day pretreatment with this antibody but that in references was not at all. Putting these present results together with the previous finding that anti-granulocyte antibody greatly reduces circulatory Gr-1+ leukocytes, 1 to 3 days after the treatment [2], it is highly probable that PCA in W/Wv mice mediated by some antibody isotypes other than IgE and IgG1 is produced by PAF mainly released from Gr-1+ cells, while IgG1 antibody-mediated PCA in mast cell-bearing reference mice is evoked by histamine derived from mast cells. PCA homologous to that in W/Wv mice could also be produced in the reference mice on sensitization with undiluted or slightly diluted antiserum, when generalized blueing due to excess IgG1 antibody was removed by the oxatomide treatment before the antigen challenge.",M4
9635414,"Simple spectrophotometric analysis of passive and active ear cutaneous anaphylaxis in the mouse.Homologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) and active cutaneous anaphylaxis (ACA) to ovalbumin and DNP-hapten were studied in the ears of female BALB/c mice by means of assessing Evans blue dye leakage. For the quantitative evaluation of PCA and ACA, a hand-held spectrophotometer and the conventional colorimetric method were used to detect the amount of extravasated dye. The value of deltaE*ab (a numerical expression of color) obtained with the hand-held spectrophotometer and the amount of extravasated dye showed a good correlation. In the mouse ear, the sensitivity of PCA reaction was comparable to that of PCA in the rat, and deltaE*ab in the PCA and ACA reactions correlated well with the dilutions of sera and of the antigen, respectively. Thus, using a hand-held spectrophotometer is a simple, quantitative and sensitive method for ascertaining the extent of immediate-type hypersensitivity in the mouse.",M4
9513924,"Sex differences in immune responses to cephalothin in guinea pigs.Guinea pigs of two strains, outbred Hartley and inbred Strain 2, were immunized subcutaneously with cephalothin (CET, 20 mg/body) alone, without adjuvant. Immune responses to the antibiotic were assessed by guinea-pig passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (GP-<e>PCA</e>) and active systemic anaphylaxis (GP-ASA) reactions. The immune response to CET in the female Hartley guinea pigs was higher than that in the males. In contrast, no difference in response to CET in Strain 2 guinea pigs was observed between males and females. These results suggested that female Hartley guinea pigs possessing a higher response should be employed in antigenicity studies involving the beta-lactam antibiotics.",M4
9642030,"Antiallergic/antiasthmatic activity of oligopeptide related to IgE.In spite of continuous research in the field of bronchial asthma, still no satisfactory drug is available. Recently a new class of oligopeptide exhibited antiallergic activity by inhibiting the synthesis of IgE antibody. The analogue of ADSDGK (94-335) has shown antiallergic activity in experimental models. The 94-335 inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (<e>PCA</e>) reactions in rats in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-10 mg kg-1 p.o.) by 47-90%. There was a 70-87% protection of mast cell degranulation induced by compound 48/80 with peptide 94-335 at 0.5-1.5 mg kg-1 p.o. in rats. This peptide also inhibited antigen- induced contraction in sensitised guinea pig ileum. There was 18 and 72% protection to bronchoconstriction induced by histamine and egg albumin, respectively, in an aerosol test in guinea pigs. These effects of compound 94-335 were comparable with that of the clinically-used antiallergic drug disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). The results suggest that peptide 94-335 possesses potent antiallergic activity.",M4
18601957,"Effects of serotonin depletion on the hippocampal GR/MR and BDNF expression during the stress adaptation.Increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) release in the hippocampus induced by repeated stress is thought to be critical for the neuroadaptation that alleviates the adverse effects of stressors on emotion and behavior. A failure in this process may be one of the primary neuropathological mechanisms underlying the development of stress-related disorders. The para-chloroamphetamine (p-<e>PCA</e>) was used to deplete 5-HT in the rat prior to repeated restraint stress (6h/day for 10 days), and determined the consequences of 5-HT depletion on stress-induced alterations of animal behaviors, hippocampal corticosteroid receptor immunoreactivity and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression. Behavioral tests indicate that the stressed rats with 5-HT depletion showed pronounced anxiety, reduced reward sensitivity and enhanced learned-helplessness. In addition, they also developed learning impairments in Morris water maze tests. These results suggest that hippocampal 5-HT depletion compromised adaptation to chronic stress. Furthermore, repeated stress caused a lesser degree of glucocorticoid receptor increase and down-regulation of BDNF mRNA. The study suggest that 5-HT deficiency in the adult hippocampus may impair stress adaptation by suppressing hippocampal GR and BDNF expression.",M5
19224364,"Altered postsynaptic-density-levels of caldendrin in the para-chloroamphetamine-induced serotonin syndrome but not in the rat ketamine model of psychosis.Caldendrin is a synaptic calcium sensor protein that is tightly associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD). Previous work has shown that the association of the protein with the synapse is highly dynamic and is increased in an activity-dependent manner. In the present study the caldendrin-association with the postsynaptic cytomatrix was analyzed in animal models of psychosis and drug abuse induced neurotoxicity. Subchronic administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist ketamine, serving as a model of NMDA-receptor hypofunction and schizophrenia showed no significant effect on the PSD-levels of caldendrin, indicating that NMDA-receptor activity is not required to keep caldendrin at the synapse. However, administration of high doses of the serotonergic neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) lead to significant changes in the association of caldendrin with the PSD. These results underscore the dynamic association of caldendrin with the PSD and suggest a role of this synaptic calcium sensor in the PCA-induced serotonin syndrome.",M5
18207332,"Serotonergic and noradrenergic lesions suppress the enhancing effect of maternal exercise during pregnancy on learning and memory in rat pups.The beneficial effects of exercise on learning and memory are well documented but the effects of prenatal exposure to maternal exercise on offspring are not clear yet. Using a two-trial-per-day Morris water maze for five consecutive days, succeeded by a probe trial 2 days later we showed that maternal voluntary exercise (wheel running) by pregnant rats increased the acquisition phase of the pups' learning. Maternal forced swimming by pregnant rats increased both acquisition and retention phases of the pups' learning. Also we found that the rat pups whose mother was submitted to forced-swimming during pregnancy had significantly higher brain, liver, heart and kidney weights compared with their sedentary counterparts. On the other hand we estimated the cell number of different regions of the hippocampus in the rat pups. We found that both exercise models during pregnancy increased the cell number in cornus ammonis subregion 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in rat pups. To determine the role that noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors hold in mediation of the maternal exercise in offspring, we used N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) and MK-801 to eliminate or block the above systems, respectively. Blocking the NMDA receptors, significantly abolished learning and memory in rat pups from all three experimental groups. Elimination of noradrenergic or serotonergic input did not significantly attenuate the learning and memory in rat pups whose mothers were sedentary, while it significantly reversed the positive effects of maternal exercise during pregnancy on rat pups' learning and memory. The presented results suggest that noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in offspring brain seem to have a crucial specific role in mediating the effects of maternal physical activity during pregnancy on rat pups' cognitive function in both models of voluntary and forced exercise.",M5
18342379,"Acquisition and retention of enhanced active avoidance are unaffected by interference with serotonergic activity.Pre-training administration of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) produces reliable deficits of avoidance learning. When animals are trained in inhibitory avoidance with relatively high foot-shock intensities, other amnesic treatments have no effect. The present experiment was conducted to determine if this protective effect of high foot shock is also observed after administration of PCA (10mg/kg, i.p., injected 7 days before training; this dose produces a lesion of central serotonin neurons). Rats were trained in active avoidance (a single 20-trial session), administering shocks of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, or 1.4 mA to independent groups of rats. When compared to saline-injected groups trained with the same intensities, PCA produced a significant learning deficit in the low foot-shock groups, but not in the high foot-shock animals. These results indicate that the dose of PCA administered, which is known to deplete cerebral serotonin, does not interfere with acquisition and retention of enhanced active avoidance training.",M5
17884257,"Changes in regional long-term oxidative metabolism induced by partial serotonergic denervation and chronic variable stress in rat brain.Stressful experiences and genetic predisposition have both independent and interactive contributions to the development of depression. The serotonergic system is involved in the development of depression, and administration of neurotoxins that specifically compromise its function leads to symptoms of affective disorders. In order to find out which brain regions are most affected by stress, partial serotonergic denervation and their combination, chronic variable stress (CVS) was applied for 3 week. Serotonergic denervation was elicited by parachloroampetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 2mg/kg), and cytochrome oxidase histochemistry was used to characterize the long-term levels of neuronal oxidative energy metabolism. PCA pretreatment blocked the increase in oxidative activity in chronically stressed rats in medial preoptic area, cortical and medial amygdala. PCA raised oxidative activity compared to control animals in substantia nigra and ventrolateral division of laterodorsal thalamus. CVS reduced the oxidative activity induced by PCA in suprachiasmatic hypothalamus, anteroventral thalamus, hippocampal CA3 region and cortical amygdala. In the dorsal part of the anterior olfactory nucleus chronic stress blocked the decrease in oxidative activity evoked by PCA. Conclusively, partial serotonergic denervation with PCA and chronic variable stress both had independent effects on long-term energy metabolism in several rat brain structures, tending to increase it. However, partial serotonergic denervation by parachloroampetamine and chronic variable stress had in many brain regions an interactive effect on energy metabolism, each factor reducing the effect of the other, which could reflect the weakening of adaptive mechanisms.",M5
17933387,"Effects of reserpine and p-chloroamphetamine on 5-HT metabolism and release in the cerebral ganglia of Inachis io (Lepidoptera).There have been few pharmacological studies of serotonergic system dynamics in insects. A more precise knowledge of the response of serotonergic neurons to drugs will contribute to understanding of the role of this neurotransmitter in insect behaviour. The present work was carried out to study several aspects of serotonin (5-HT) metabolism and release in an insect, the butterfly Inachis io. The effects of a single intra-abdominal injection of reserpine (30 pg/insect) or p-chloroamphetamine (50 microg/insect) on cerebral ganglia 5-HT metabolism and release were studied. After reserpine injection a depletion of 5-HT stores concomitant with an increase in N-acetylserotonin levels was observed, but not significant alteration of extraneuronal 5-HT release was observed. Administration of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) induced extraneuronal 5-HT release, together with inhibition of its reuptake. Finally, a single injection of p-chloroamphetamine in reserpine-treated insects was able to induce new release of 5-HT. Reserpine interferes with the vesicular storage of 5-HT, but does not affect the process of neuronal release, while PCA induces the synaptic release of 5-HT and inhibits its reuptake. These effects are similar to those observed in mammals.",M5
17825539,"Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the effect of fluvoxamine on p-chloroamphetamine-induced behavior.The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) correlation of the effect of fluvoxamine on para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>)-induced behavior was determined in the rat. Rats (n=66) with permanent arterial and venous cannulas received a 30-min intravenous infusion of 1.0, 3.7 or 7.3 mg kg(-1) fluvoxamine. At various time points after the start of fluvoxamine administration, a single dose of PCA (2.5 mg kg(-1)) was injected in the tail vein and resulting behavioral effects, excitation (EXC), flat body posture (FBP) and forepaw trampling (FT), were immediately scored (scores: 0, 1, 2 or 3) over a period of 5 min. In each individual animal the time course of the fluvoxamine plasma concentration was determined up to the time of PCA administration. Observed behavioral effects were related to fluvoxamine plasma concentrations. Fluvoxamine pharmacokinetics was described by a population three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. The effects of fluvoxamine on PCA-induced behavior (probability of EXC, FBP and FT) were directly related to fluvoxamine plasma concentration on the basis of the proportional odds model. For EXC, EC(50) values for the cumulative probabilities P(Y&lt;1), P(Y&lt;2), P(Y&lt;3) were 237+/-39, 174+/-28 and 100+/-20 ng ml(-1), respectively. Slightly higher EC(50) values were obtained for the corresponding effects on FBP and FT. This investigation demonstrates the feasibility of PK-PD modeling of categorical drug effects in animal behavioral pharmacology. This constitutes a basis for the future development of a mechanism-based PK-PD model for fluvoxamine in this paradigm.",M5
17826880,"Rat behavior after chronic variable stress and partial lesioning of 5-HT-ergic neurotransmission: effects of citalopram.Deficits in serotonergic (5-HT-ergic) neurotransmission and stressful life events have been implicated in affective disorders, and chronic variable stress (CVS) can elicit behavioral changes reminiscent of increased emotionality, anxiety and atypical depression after partial 5-HT depletion. This study examined the effect of chronic citalopram treatment (10 mg/kg daily) on these changes. Parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) (2 mg/kg) reduced the levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the frontal cortex, increased anxiety in the social interaction test, and increased activity in the open field. CVS reduced social activity in the social interaction test and immobility time in the forced swimming test. Reduction of excrements left during immobilization indicated partial adaptation with the CVS. Specific stressors had different effects on body weight gain, shorter lasting stressors having a smaller effect in general than those that lasted longer. Combination of CVS and PCA increased sucrose intake after two weeks of stress. In addition, combination of the two treatments reduced diving in the forced swimming test. Citalopram prevented the increase in sucrose consumption in the PCA+CVS rats, and in 5-HT-depleted animals blocked the increase in struggling and reduced the number of defecations in the forced swim test. In conclusion, citalopram treatment prevented several effects of either 5-HT depletion or combined PCA+CVS treatment, suggesting that these behavioral changes could be used in studies on the neural mechanisms underlying emotional behavior that may have relevance to the neurobiology of depression.",M5
17407499,"The effects of p-chloroamphetamine, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) on the gene expression of cytoskeletal proteins in the rat brain.Repeated administration of beta-phenylalkylamines is known to produce neuronal changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems of mammals. It is suggested that various components of the cytoskeleton undergo profound alterations after amphetamine use and misuse, contributing to behavioral changes and neurotoxicity. Here we studied the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and beta-actin after repeated intraperitoneal applications with equimolar doses of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), methamphetamine (METH) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the brain of male Wistar rats. Effective (molecular) pharmacological doses (ED) were derived and used for the calculation of (molecular) pharmacological indices (PI). Besides clear but different dose-response curves on the toxicity of the drugs, in situ hybridization and Western blot analysis revealed that repeated administration of these compounds resulted in different substance- and dose-dependent changes in MAP2 gene expression, e.g. in the frontoparietal somatosensoric cortex. In contrast, the expression of beta-actin was not influenced by any of the compounds at the dose levels tested. Lethal doses were determined with 2.1 (PCA), &gt;5.1 (METH) and 8.4 mg/kg/day (MDMA). Linear and non-linear repeat-dose lethality was observed for MDMA and PCA, respectively, whereas METH was non-lethal in the dose range used. Values for ED(MAP2) were 0.3, 0.52 and &gt;16.8 mg/kg/day, and therefore those for PI(MAP2) were 20, 4, and 0.5 for METH, PCA and MDMA, respectively. Although the results on mortality did not reflect changes in MAP2 gene expression, they suggest a remarkable difference for those amphetamines without substituents or with a halogen atom at the paraposition of the benzene ring, such as METH or PCA, when compared with MDMA-like substances.",M5
17719142,"CB1-cannabinoid receptors are involved in the modulation of non-synaptic [3H]serotonin release from the rat hippocampus.In the present study we investigated whether serotonin release in the hippocampus is subject to regulation via cannabinoid receptors. Both rat and mouse hippocampal slices were preincubated with [3H]serotonin ([3H]5-HT) and superfused with medium containing serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram hydrobromide (300 nM). The cannabinoid receptor agonist R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl) methanone mesylate (WIN55,212-2, 1 microM) did not affect either the resting or the electrically evoked [3H]5-HT release. In the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5, 50 microM) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione-disodium (CNQX, 10 microM) the evoked [3H]5-HT release was decreased significantly. Similar findings were obtained when CNQX (10 microM) was applied alone with WIN55,212-2. This effect was abolished by the selective cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1) antagonists N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716, 1 microM) and 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide trifluoroacetate salt (AM251, 1 microM). Similarly to that observed in rats, WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) decreased the evoked [3H]5-HT efflux in wild-type mice (CB1+/+). The inhibitory effect of WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) was completely absent in hippocampal slices derived from mice genetically deficient in CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1-/-). Relatively selective degeneration of fine serotonergic axons by the neurotoxin parachloramphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) reduced significantly the tritium uptake and the evoked [3H]5-HT release. In addition, PCA, eliminated the effect of WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) on the stimulation-evoked [3H]5-HT efflux. In contrast to the PCA-treated animals, WIN55,212-2 (1 microM) reduced the [3H]5-HT efflux in the saline-treated group. Our data suggest that a subpopulation of non-synaptic serotonergic afferents express CB1 receptors and activation of these CB1 receptors leads to a decrease in 5-HT release.",M5
16989875,"Monoaminergic system lesions increase post-sigh respiratory pattern disturbance during sleep in rats.Monoamines are important regulators of behavioral state and respiratory pattern, and the impact of monoaminergic control during sleep is of particular interest for the stability of breathing regulation. The aim of this study was to test the effects of systemically induced chemical lesions to noradrenergic and serotonergic efferent systems, on the expression of sleep-wake states, pontine wave activity, and sleep-related respiratory pattern and its variability. In chronically instrumented male adult Sprague-Dawley rats we lesioned noradrenergic terminal axonal branches by a single intraperitoneal dose of DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-brombenzilamine; 50 mg/kg, i.p.), and serotonergic axonal terminals by two intraperitoneal doses, 24 h apart, of <e>PCA</e> (p-chloroamphetamine; 6 mg/kg, i.p.). In each animal, we recorded sleep, pontine waves (P-waves) and breathing at baseline, following sham injection, and every week for 5 weeks following injection of either systemic neurotoxin. Distinct responses were observed to the two lesions. DSP-4 lesions were associated with a trend toward increased NREM sleep (p &lt; 0.06), decreased wakefulness (p &lt; 0.05) and increased respiratory tidal volume during NREM (p = 0.0002) and REM (p = 0.0001) sleep with respect to baseline. None of these effects, however, were observed during the first 14 days after injection. No significant changes were observed in the frequency of apneas or sighs, nor in the coupling between these two, at any time after DSP-4 injection. Conversely, selective serotonergic lesion by PCA produced no change in the baseline respiratory frequency or tidal volume during sleep or wakefulness, nor was the expression of Wake, NREM or REM sleep affected. Instead, PCA injection resulted in a sustained increase in the frequency and duration of post-sigh apneas (PS) during NREM sleep (p = 0.002). This reflected increased coupling between sighs and apneas, because neither the frequency nor the amplitude of spontaneous sighs was altered by PCA.",M5
17016708,"Relationship between limbic and cortical 5-HT neurotransmission and acquisition and reversal learning in a go/no-go task in rats.RATIONALE: Specific brain structures have been suggested to be involved in impulsive responding assessed by a variety of operant tasks. Central serotonin (5-HT) function has also been widely implicated in impulsivity; however, little research has addressed the regional aspect of 5-HT roles in different impulsive indices of task performance. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the relationships between acquisition and reversal learning in a go/no-go task as different behavioral measures of impulsivity and focal concentrations of 5-HT and its metabolites in the brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats administered with parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) and vehicle were tested in both acquisition and reversal phases in a go/no-go visual discrimination task. Neurochemical analysis was performed to determine 5-HT concentrations in micropunched brain tissues. RESULTS: PCA administration induced regionally 5-HT depletion in the brain and impaired learning performance in both tests. For both tests, significant negative correlations between learning performance and 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala (Amyg). In contrast, significant negative correlations between learning performance and 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations were observed for the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) exclusively in the reversal learning phase. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that 5-HT neurotransmission to the mPFC and Amyg is involved in inhibitory control over responses to discriminated stimuli associated with the go/no-go paradigm common to both tests. In contrast, 5-HT neurotransmission to the OFC is especially involved in additional processes associated with reversal learning.",M5
16452989,"Loss of serotonin transporter protein after MDMA and other ring-substituted amphetamines.We studied in vivo expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), or fenfluramine (FEN) treatments, and compared the effects of substituted amphetamines to those of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), an established serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. All drug treatments produced lasting reductions in 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and [(3)H]paroxetine binding, but no significant change in the density of a 70 kDa band initially thought to correspond to the SERT protein. Additional Western blot studies, however, showed that the 70 kDa band did not correspond to the SERT protein, and that a diffuse band at 63-68 kDa, one that had the anticipated regional brain distribution of SERT protein (midbrain&gt;striatum&gt;neocortex&gt;cerebellum), was reduced after 5,7-DHT and was absent in SERT-null animals, was decreased after MDMA, PCA, or FEN treatments. In situ immunocytochemical (ICC) studies with the same two SERT antisera used in Western blot studies showed loss of SERT-immunoreactive (IR) axons after 5,7-DHT and MDMA treatments. In the same animals, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)-IR axon density was comparably reduced, indicating that serotonergic deficits after substituted amphetamines differ from those in SERT-null animals, which have normal TPH levels but, in the absence of SERT, develop apparent neuroadaptive changes in 5-HT metabolism. Together, these results suggest that lasting serotonergic deficits after MDMA and related drugs are unlikely to represent neuroadaptive metabolic responses to changes in SERT trafficking, and favor the view that substituted amphetamines have the potential to produce a distal axotomy of brain 5-HT neurons.",M5
16510484,"The acute and long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA on marble burying behaviour in mice.When mice are exposed to harmless objects such as marbles in their cage they bury them, a behaviour sometimes known as defensive burying. We investigated the effect of an acute dose of MDMA (èecstasy') and other psychoactive drugs on marble burying and also examined the effect of a prior neurotoxic dose of MDMA or p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) on burying. Acute administration of MDMA produced dose-dependent inhibition of marble burying (EC50: 7.6 micro mol/kg). Other drugs that enhance monoamine function also produced dose-dependent inhibition: methamphetamine PCA paroxetine MDMA GBR 12909 methylphenidate. None of these drugs altered locomotor activity at a dose that inhibited burying. A prior neurotoxic dose of MDMA, which decreased striatal dopamine content by 60%, but left striatal 5-HT content unaltered, did not alter spontaneous marble burying 18 or 40 days later. However, a neurotoxic dose of PCA which decreased striatal dopamine by 60% and striatal 5-HT by 70% attenuated marble burying 28 days later. Overall, these data suggest that MDMA, primarily by acutely increasing 5-HT function, acts like several anxiolytic drugs in this behavioural model. Long-term loss of cerebral 5-HT content also produced a similar effect. Since this change was observed only after 28 days, it is probably due to an adaptive response in the brain.",M5
16413602,"Evidence for an involvement of peripheral serotonin in p-chloroamphetamine-induced ejaculation of rats.The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism of the ejaculatory response induced by the 5-HT-releasing compound p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) in rats. The ejaculatory response was assessed by weighing the coagulated seminal materials accumulated over 1 h. Intraperitoneal injection of PCA (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in both the incidence of ejaculation and the weight of the accumulated seminal materials. The ejaculatory response induced by PCA (5.0 mg/kg) was abolished by pretreatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine, the 5-HT receptor antagonists methysergide and MDL72222, or by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram, suggesting that the 5-HT-releasing property of PCA mainly involved the expression of ejaculation. Neither the section of the spinal cord at thoracic (T8-9) level nor the lumbosacral spinal 5-HT denervation by intrathecal (i.t.) injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine affected the ejaculatory response induced by PCA. The i.t. injection of PCA (20-160 microg/rat) at lumbosacral spinal level did not exert the systemic PCA-like prominent effect on ejaculation, whereas i.t. injection of lidocain at the same site completely abolished the response to systemic PCA. Additionally, the peripherally administered 5-HT (0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the proejaculatory effect at a threshold dose (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) of PCA. From these observations, it is concluded that the ejaculatory response induced by PCA is mainly a spinally mediated reflex response that is triggered by the release of 5-HT in the peripheral sites.",M5
16452525,"Role of peripheral innervation in p-chloroamphetamine-induced ejaculation in anesthetized rats.The occurrence of ejaculation, which consists of 2 distinct phases (emission and expulsion), requires a tight coordination of peripheral autonomic and somatic nerves. However, some aspects of the mechanism of ejaculation are not clearly defined. To clarify this issue, we used the p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>)-induced ejaculation model in anesthetized rats and investigated the effects of selective peripheral nerves lesions on seminal vesicle and bulbospongiosus (BS) muscle activities as representing physiological markers of emission and expulsion phases, respectively. In intact rats, ejaculation induced with PCA (intraperitoneal 5 mg/kg) correlated with coordinated increases in seminal vesicle pressure (SVP) and BS electromyographic activity. PCA-induced ejaculation was still observed in rats with bilateral lesion of hypogastric nerves (HNx), lumbar paravertebral sympathetic chain (LSCx), or dorsal nerves of the penis (DNPx). Conversely, bilateral section of pelvic nerves (PNx) or L6-S1 dorsal roots (DRx) abolished PCA-induced ejaculation. The amplitude of SVP increases induced by PCA was reduced in PNx, HNx, and LSCx rats, whereas it was unchanged in DRx and DNPx rats. The time interval between SVP increases and BS muscle contractions induced by PCA was comparable in the different neural lesion groups. In conclusion, PCA initiates both emission and expulsion independently from each other. In this model, afferents conveyed by the pelvic nerves appear to be unnecessary for occurrence of BS muscle contractions but are essential for a complete ejaculatory response.",M5
16206279,"In situ expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or neurotrophin-3 promotes sprouting of cortical serotonergic axons following a neurotoxic lesion.Neurotrophins promote sprouting and elongation of central nervous system (CNS) axons following injury. Consequently, it has been suggested that neurotrophins could be used to repair the CNS by inducing axonal sprouting from nearby intact axons, thereby compensating for the loss of recently injured axons. We tested whether long-term overexpression of neurotrophins in the rat cortex would induce sprouting of cortical serotonergic axons following a neurotoxic injury. After a single subcutaneous injection of para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 9 mg/ml) that lesions the majority of serotonergic axons in the rat cortex, we injected adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Adv.BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (Adv.NT-3), or nerve growth factor (Adv.NGF) into the rat frontal cortex. Nine days later, we measured significant increases in the concentration of the respective neurotrophins surrounding the vector injection sites, as measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemical localization of serotonin revealed a fourfold increase in the density of serotonergic fibers surrounding the injection sites of Adv.BDNF and Adv.NT-3, corresponding to a 50% increase in cortical serotonin concentration, compared with a control vector containing the cDNA for enhanced green fluorescent protein (Adv.EGFP). In contrast, there was no difference in serotonergic fiber density or cortical serotonin concentration surrounding the injection of Adv.NGF compared with Adv.EGFP. These data demonstrate that localized overexpression of BDNF or NT-3, but not NGF, is sufficient to promote sprouting of serotonergic axons in the cortex following an experimental neurotoxic injury.",M5
16378218,"Alcohol-induced impulsivity in rats: an effect of cue salience?RATIONALE: There is a common assumption that alcohol produces impulsive behaviors, thereby increasing the preference for immediate over delayed rewards. An alternative explanation, provided by alcohol myopia theory, is that alcohol alters attentional processes such that intoxicated individuals respond exclusively to the most salient cues in their environment. OBJECTIVES: We tested these two hypotheses in rats using standard (impulsivity) and modified (cue salience) versions of the delayed reinforcement task. METHODS: In the impulsivity paradigm, rats were trained to choose between a small immediate reward (2 sucrose pellets) and a large delayed reward (12 sucrose pellets after 10 s) in a T-maze. In the cue salience paradigm, a light in one arm predicted either the small or the large reward, but the arm paired with the light varied across trials. In separate experiments, we examined how changes in delay to the large reward, alcohol administration, or alcohol combined with either a serotonin agonist [para-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) at doses of 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.)] or a dopamine antagonist [cis-(Z)-flupenthixol dihydrochloride (alpha-flupenthixol) at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.] affected performance in each task. RESULTS: Increasing the delay to the large reward increased impulsivity in both paradigms, but it had no effect on responding to a salient cue. Alcohol (0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.8 g/kg, i.p.) increased the choice of the immediate reward and increased the choice of the lit arm, regardless of whether it signaled the small or the large reward. pCA selectively reduced alcohol-induced impulsivity, whereas alpha-flupenthixol selectively reduced responding to a salient cue. CONCLUSIONS: Rats, like humans, are influenced by cue salience when intoxicated. Although this alcohol myopia effect could explain alcohol-induced impulsivity, the two processes are probably distinct because they are mediated by dissociable pharmacological mechanisms.",M5
15900317,"Impaired object recognition memory following methamphetamine, but not p-chloroamphetamine- or d-amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.Repeated moderate doses of methamphetamine (mAMPH) damage forebrain monoaminergic terminals and nonmonoaminergic cells in somatosensory cortex, and impair performance in a novelty preference task of object recognition (OR). This study aimed to determine whether the memory deficit seen after a neurotoxic mAMPH regimen results from damage to dopamine (DA) and/or serotonin (5-HT) terminals. Animals were given a neurotoxic regimen of mAMPH, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, preferentially damages 5-HT terminals), d-amphetamine (d-AMPH, preferentially damages DA terminals), or saline. After 1 week, animals were trained and tested for OR memory. Rats treated with mAMPH showed no recognition memory during the short-term memory (STM) test, whereas both PCA- and d-AMPH-treated rats showed OR STM scores comparable to controls. After behavioral testing, the specificity of monoaminergic lesions was determined by postmortem [125I]RTI-55 binding to dopamine (DAT) and serotonin (SERT) transporter proteins. Tissue from a separate group of animals killed 3 days after drug treatment was processed for Fluoro-Jade (F-J) fluorescence histochemistry to detect damaged cortical neurons. mAMPH-treated rats showed reductions in striatal DAT and hippocampal (HC) and perirhinal (pRh) SERT, as well as degeneration of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex. In PCA-treated rats, HC and pRh SERT were substantially depleted, but striatal DAT and cortical neuron survival were unaffected. By contrast, d-AMPH-treated animals showed marked depletions in striatal DAT and cortical neurodegeneration, but HC and pRh SERT were unaffected. This pattern of results indicates that no single feature of mAMPH-induced neurotoxicity is sufficient to produce the OR impairments seen after mAMPH treatment.",M5
15923387,"Serotoninergic system blockage in the prepubertal rat inhibits spermatogenesis development.The stimulatory and inhibitory role of serotonin in gonadotropin secretion and in the onset of puberty in the male rat has been previously described, but its role in the establishment of spermatogenesis is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of serotoninergic inhibition by p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) on the prepubertal-to-adult stage of the rat reproductive system. Hypothalamic serotonin, gonadotropins and sex steroid hormone concentrations were measured, and a histopathological analysis of seminiferous epithelium was carried out on animals treated with pCA from day 30 and killed at 45 or 65 days of age. The pCA treatment significantly reduced the hypothalamic levels of serotonin and its metabolite (5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid). This inhibition did not affect the sex steroid hormone or LH concentrations, but rather it induced an increase in FSH concentration in animals of both ages. Spermatogenesis was impaired by pCA treatment. Disruption of seminiferous epithelium and the death of numerous germ cells were observed. Sperm produced by pCA-treated animals was of poor quality and appeared in small quantities. Apparently, serotonin depletion did not affect communication between the hypothalamus and the pituitary, but the FSH increase could have been related to alterations in the seminiferous epithelium effects. The seminiferous epithelium cycle was altered in rats killed at both 45 and 65 days of age, because at each age of killing the distribution of spermatogenesis stages was different. Germ cell apoptosis did not appear to be related to changes in the FSH concentrations, but other factors produced during spermatogenesis could have been involved in this induction. This study showed that serotonin was necessary for the development of normal spermatogenesis in prepubertal rats.",M5
15680692,"Blockade of stimulant-induced preprodynorphin mRNA expression in the striatal matrix by serotonin depletion.Cocaine and methamphetamine (METH) induce preprodynorphin (PPD) mRNA expression in the striatum. Cocaine induces PPD expression in both the patch and matrix compartments of the rostral striatum, whereas METH induces PPD expression in the patch compartment of the rostral striatum. In middle striatum, both stimulants increase PPD expression in the patch and matrix compartments. METH and cocaine treatment also increase extracellular serotonin (5-HT). Several studies have shown that 5-HT receptors are present on striatonigral neurons that express PPD mRNA, and that 5-HT is a positive regulator of striatal neuropeptide expression. The current study examined whether 5-HT plays a role in the patch/matrix expression of PPD mRNA induced by cocaine and METH in striatum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 8 mg/kg, i.p), a serotonin neurotoxin, 1 week prior to cocaine (30 mg/kg, i.p) and METH (15 mg/kg, s.c.) treatment. The 80% loss of 5-HT induced by PCA-pretreatment blocked cocaine-induced PPD expression in the rostral matrix compartment. Cocaine- and METH-induced PPD expression in the rostral patch compartment was unaffected by PCA-pretreatment. PCA-pretreatment also decreased both cocaine- and METH-induced PPD expression in the matrix, but not patch of middle striatum. PCA-induced 5-HT depletion did not affect stimulant-induced increases in PPT mRNA expression in the striatum. These data suggest that 5-HT plays a role in stimulant-induced PPD expression in the matrix compartment of rostral and middle striatum. Thus, 5-HT innervation may play a critical role in basal ganglia function.",M5
15820524,"Partial serotonergic denervation decreases progenitor cell proliferation in the adult rat hippocampus, but has no effect on rat behavior in the forced swimming test.It has been hypothesized that impaired serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of depression. Recently, it was shown in adult animals that antidepressants which influence 5-HT levels increase hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, suggesting an important role of the 5-HT system in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of partial 5-HT denervation of the adult rat forebrain caused by a single para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) administration (10 mg/kg, s.c.) on hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry over a 3-week time period. Moreover, behavior of rats was analyzed by using the forced swimming test which serves as a so-called animal model of depression. One week after PCA administration, a significant decrease of Ki-67 immunopositive cells and cell clusters (-25% and -53%, respectively) was found which was recovered over the 3-week period. The decrease in progenitor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus per animal was positively correlated with the 5-HT denervation. Behavioral analysis of rats revealed no significant differences between vehicle and PCA-treated animals at any of the examined time points. These findings indicate a regulative role of 5-HT for hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis, but its relation to animal models of depression remains to be elucidated.",M5
15219272,"Microautoradiography of [123I]ADAM in mice treated with fluoxetine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.A radiopharmaceutical, (123)I-labeled 2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine ([(123)I]ADAM), has been developed recently for evaluation of how serotonin transporters (SERT) function in the brain. However, the detailed biodistribution and specific binding in certain brain areas are not well investigated. In this study, both phosphor plate imaging and microautoradiography were applied to explore the binding characteristics of [(123)I]ADAM in SERT neurons. The effect of two psychotropics and one narcotic on the binding of [(123)I]ADAM to SERT was also studied. Fluoxetine and desipramine, both are psychotropics and specific SERT ligands and decreased the affinity of [(123)I]ADAM, while p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), a narcotic, destroyed most of serotonergic neurons, as well as reducing the concentration of serotonin and the number of SERT in the brain as shown by the biodistribution of [(123)I]ADAM. Significant and selective accumulation of [(123)I]ADAM in the areas from midbrain to brain stem in normal mice with maximum target-to-background ratio was found at 90 minutes postinjection. A rapid clearance of [(131)I]ADAM at 120 minutes postinjection was found in the CA1, CA3 and ThN brain areas. In addition, the inhibition effect on binding ability of [(123)I]ADAM to SERT by the psychotropics and the narcotic was found to have the order of: PCA &gt; fluoxetine &gt; desipramine.",M5
15234115,"Increased behavioural activity of rats in forced swimming test after partial denervation of serotonergic system by parachloroamphetamine treatment.The present study aimed at characterizing the effect of partial 5-HT denervation by parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), a 5-HT selective neurotoxin, on forced swimming behaviour and monoamine levels in several rat brain regions. PCA was administered intraperitoneally in two independent experiments in doses of 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg and in doses 1, 2, 4 mg/kg, respectively. PCA (2 mg/kg) reduced immobility in the forced swimming test in the Experiment 1 and according to Experiment 2 this is explained by increased swimming time. Dose-dependent reductions in 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were found in all brain regions studied, and the maximal effects were of a similar magnitude. In septum, the effect of PCA took more time to develop. The effects of the lowest dose of PCA suggest that the neurotoxin affects not only the dorsal raphe projection areas but also the fine axons which arise from the median raphe. alpha2-Adrenoceptors and beta-adrenoceptors in cerebral cortex were not affected by the PCA treatment. Binding affinity of the 5-HT(1A) receptors was higher after all doses of PCA. On the second exposure to the forced swimming the time spent in swimming was found to be negatively and the time spent in immobile posture positively correlated with serotonin turnover in frontal cortex. The time spent in struggling on the second exposure to test was found to be negatively correlated with KD of beta-adrenoceptor binding in cerebral cortex. These data suggest that partial 5-HT denervation with low doses of PCA, which elicits a specific pattern of neurodegeneration, results in an increased behavioural activity, and that the traditional interpretation of the measures in forced swimming test, despite of the test's predictive power in revealing antidepressants acting on monoaminergic systems, is not adequate for studies on the neurochemical basis of depression.",M5
14997015,"Role of serotonin on cocaine-mediated effects on prodynorphin gene expression in the rat brain.The effect of the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine was examined on prodynorphin gene expression. Fluoxetine or vehicle was infused continuously for 7 d via osmotic minipumps into male rats. Northern blot analysis showed significant increases in prodynorphin gene expression in the hypothalamus (171% of controls) and significant decreases in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens (62% and 70% of controls, respectively). There were no significant changes in the hippocampus. Thus, chronic inhibition of serotonin uptake can regulate prodynorphin gene expression in the hypothalamus, caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Fluoxetine effects were also evaluated in rats treated with p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), a neurotoxin that depletes serotonin. Because we previously reported that continuous infusion of cocaine for 7 d (which inhibits dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine uptake), or GBR 12909 (a selective dopamine uptake inhibitor), produced significant decreases in the hypothalamus and cocaine also produced a significant increase in prodynorphin gene expression in caudate putamen, regulation of prodynorphin gene expression by fluoxetine is suggested to be different from that by cocaine. Because neither a selective dopamine uptake inhibitor nor a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor produced the same effect as cocaine in the caudate putamen, this effect is likely regulated by the inhibition of norepinephrine uptake, by a combination of effects on two or three neurotransmitter transporters, or by a mechanism unrelated to transporter inhibition.",M5
15073265,"Characterization of the binding sites for 123I-ADAM and the relationship to the serotonin transporter in rat and mouse brains using quantitative autoradiography.Imaging of serotonin transporter (SERT) in the central nervous system may provide an important tool to evaluate some psychiatric disorders. Recently, a novel (123)I-labeled radiotracer, 2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine ((123)I-ADAM), has been developed that exhibited a high selectivity for SERT. The aim of this study was to characterize the biodistribution and specificity of (123)I-ADAM to SERT using quantitative autoradiography in both control and neurotoxin-treated animals. METHODS: (123)I-ADAM (74 MBq) was injected intravenously into the mice to access its biodistribution in the brain via quantitative autoradiography. Further, rats with serotonin depleted by intraperitoneal injection of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) were used to evaluate the specificity of (123)I-ADAM to SERT. The levels of biogenic amines were then measured and correlated with quantitative (123)I-ADAM labeling in control and PCA-treated rat brains. RESULTS: The autoradiographic results showed that (123)I-ADAM accumulated in SERT-rich brain areas after systemic injection, including the globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, interpeduncular nucleus, amygdala, and raphe nucleus. The dorsal raphe nucleus had the highest initial uptake with a peak specific binding ratio (i.e., [target - cerebellum]/cerebellum) at 120 min after injection. (123)I-ADAM uptake was dramatically decreased in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, geniculate nuclei, hypothalamus, raphe nucleus, and substantia nigra in PCA-lesioned rats. The decrement in radioactivity was more prominent at higher dosages of PCA and was in parallel with the changes in amounts of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that regional distribution of (123)I-ADAM radioactivity is similar to the SERT localization in both rat and mouse brains. We also validated that destruction on central serotonergic neurons after PCA treatment inhibits the uptake of (123)I-ADAM in serotonin-rich brain regions. High specific binding to SERT in vivo makes (123)I-ADAM an appropriate radiotracer for solitary studies of serotonin functions in living humans.",M5
14654099,"Long-lasting behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants following p-chloroamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in mice.Amphetamine analogs such as p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) cause serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotoxicity. The behavioral consequences and the responsiveness to psychostimulants following the neurotoxic insult are unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate the outcome of neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic PCA pre-treatments on the sensitivity of Swiss Webster mice to the psychomotor stimulating effects of PCA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and cocaine. PCA (15 mg/kg x 2; i.p.) caused 37-70% depletion of dopaminergic and serotonergic markers in mouse brain. Saline and PCA (15 mg/kg x 2) mice were challenged on days 5, 12, 40 and 74 with one of the following drugs: PCA (5 mg/kg), MDMA (10 mg/kg) and cocaine (20 mg/kg). The PCA pre-exposed mice showed marked locomotor sensitization from days 5-74 to all three drugs tested. The time course of the sensitized response coincided with the time course of the neurotoxic insult as determined by reduced densities of striatal dopamine transporter and frontal cortex serotonin transporter binding sites. A single injection of PCA (5 mg/kg) caused neither neurotoxicity nor sensitization to the locomotor stimulating effects of PCA, MDMA and cocaine. Repeated administration of a low non-neurotoxic dose of PCA (5 mg/kg/day; 6 days) caused a transient locomotor sensitization to PCA that dissipated after one month. Results of the present study suggest that PCA-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotoxicity coincides with long-lasting locomotor sensitization to psychostimulants. These findings may be relevant to the psychopathology of amphetamines-induced neurotoxicity.",M5
14724042,"p-Chloroamphetamine blocks physostigmine-induced memory enhancement in rats with unilateral nucleus basalis lesions.The present experiment examined whether p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), a serotonergic releasing/depleting agent, would block the memory-enhancing effect of physostigmine in rats with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced unilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (uni-nbM). Six groups of subjects with uni-nbM lesions in addition to an isolated sham-operated control group were included. Subjects were trained and tested 72 h later on a one-trial passive avoidance task. Thirty minutes before training, rats with uni-nbM lesions were injected with either 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg PCA or saline. Immediately after training, approximately half the subjects in each group were injected with either saline or 0.06 mg/kg physostigmine. Animals in the sham group received saline injections. Saline-injected animals with uni-nbM lesions performed poorly at test, a deficit that was reversed with physostigmine. Pretraining injections of PCA blocked physostigmine's memory-enhancing effect, although motor impairment during training may have contributed to decrements in test performance in animals injected with 5.0 mg/kg. Subjects were killed about 10 days later and their frontal cortices examined for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Results from the neurochemical analysis revealed that the lesion decreased ChAT levels and that the injection of 1.0 mg/kg PCA exaggerated this lesion-induced depletion. Implications for the interaction between acetylcholine and serotonin are discussed.",M5
14559429,"Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase suppresses the maintenance but not the induction of psychomotor sensitization to MDMA ('Ecstasy') and p-chloroamphetamine in mice.Repeated exposure to psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines results in behavioral sensitization, a paradigm thought to be relevant to drug craving and addiction in humans. We have previously shown that the induction, expression, and maintenance of psychomotor sensitization to cocaine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate (indirect dopamine agonists) are blocked by co-administration of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI). In the present study, we investigated the effects of 7-NI on the induction, expression, and maintenance of psychomotor sensitization to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy') and p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). The following observations are reported: (a) Repeated administration of MDMA (10 mg/kg) and PCA (5 mg/kg) to Swiss Webster mice for six consecutive days caused a 3-fold increase in the psychomotor stimulating effect of the drugs on day 6 compared to day 1. (b) Pretreatment with 7-NI (25 mg/kg) did not affect the induction and expression of sensitization to MDMA and PCA. (c) Pretreatment with 7-NI did, however, suppress the enduring sensitized response to challenge injections of MDMA and PCA which was observed in mice pretreated with vehicle instead of 7-NI. (d) Unlike other psychostimulants, MDMA and PCA treatment did not produce conditioned (context-dependent) hyperlocomotion. These findings, coupled with our previous studies, suggest the following: (a) The induction and expression of psychomotor sensitization to MDMA and PCA are independent of nNOS activity and involve primarily serotonergic transmission. (b) The maintenance of psychomotor sensitization is dependent on intact nNOS activity and involves primarily dopaminergic transmission.",M5
14643010,"Changes in the postnatal development on nitric oxide system induced by serotonin depletion.Serotonin (5-HT) is expressed early during central nervous system (CNS) development and plays an important role during this period. Nitric oxide (NO) is also involved in neuronal development. Morphological and functional relationships between NO and 5-HT, demonstrated as alterations of the nitrergic system, were observed after a 5-HT depletion. It has been hypothesized that NO may be related to the neuronal damage induced by some 5-HT neurotoxins. A parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) treatment is able to damage ascending 5-HT fibers proceeding from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and depletes 5-HT storage in neuronal somata. In order to study the effects of a 5-HT depletion on the nitrergic system during postnatal development, Wistar rat pups were injected subcutaneously twice, on postnatal day (PND) 3 and PND4 with PCA. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunoreactivity and NADPH diaphorase reactivity were performed on brain sections from PND5, 7, 12, 19, 29 and 62 animals. After the treatment, we found an increased NADPH-d staining and nNOS immunoreactivity in striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus along the different studied time periods. Interestingly, the expression of both NO markers was higher when 5-HT depletion was more evident, suggesting a very close relationship between 5-HT and NO systems during postnatal development.",M5
12354291,"p-Methylthioamphetamine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine, two non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasers in vivo, differ from neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives in their mode of action at 5-HT nerve endings in vitro.The mechanism underlying the serotoninergic neurotoxicity of some amphetamine derivatives, such as p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is still debated. Their main acute effect, serotonin (5-HT) release from nerve endings, involves their interaction with 5-HT transporters (SERTs), as substrates. Although this interaction is required for the neurotoxic effects, 5-HT release alone may not be sufficient to induce long-term 5-HT deficits. Some non-neurotoxic compounds, including p-methylthioamphetamine (MTA) and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP), have 5-HT releasing properties in vivo and in brain slices comparable to that of neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives. We measured 5-HT release in superfused rat brain synaptosomes preloaded with [3H]5-HT, a model that distinguishes a releasing effect from reuptake inhibition. MTA and mCPP induced much lower release than pCA and MDMA. The striking difference between our findings in synaptosomes and those obtained in vivo or in brain slices is probably related to a different compartmentalisation of 5-HT in the different experimental models. Studies in synaptosomes, where the vesicular storage of 5-HT is predominant, could therefore bring to light differences between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasing agents which cannot be appreciated in other experimental models and might be useful to identify the mechanisms responsible for the neurotoxicity induced by amphetamine derivatives.",M5
14515341,"High-dose fenfluramine administration decreases serotonin transporter binding, but not serotonin transporter protein levels, in rat forebrain.Administration of D-fenfluramine (D-FEN) or parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) can produce long-lasting decreases in serotonin transporter (SERT) binding and tissue levels of serotonin (5-HT) in rat forebrain. These changes have been viewed as evidence for 5-HT neurotoxicity, but no studies have measured SERT protein levels. In the present study, we determined the effect of high-dose D-FEN or PCA, administered according to a  neurotoxic  dosing regimen, on the density of SERT sites using ligand binding methods and on SERT protein levels using Western blots. Rats were sacrificed 2 days and 2 weeks after administration of drug or saline. The density of SERT was determined in homogenates of caudate and whole brain minus caudate. D-FEN and PCA decreased SERT binding by 30-60% in both tissues and at both time points. Similarly, D-FEN and PCA administration profoundly decreased tissue 5-HT and 5-HIAA in frontal cortex. Despite the large decreases in SERT binding and depletion of tissue 5-HT that occurred with D-FEN administration, SERT protein expression, as determined by Western blot analysis, did not change in either tissue or time point. PCA administration decreased SERT protein by about 20% only at the 2-day point in the caudate. Drug treatments did not change expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a hallmark indicator of neuronal damage, in whole brain minus caudate in the 2-week group. These results support the hypothesis that decreases in tissue 5-HT and SERT binding sites induced by D-FEN and PCA reflect neuroadaptive changes, rather than neurotoxic effects.",M5
12044839,"Enhanced inhibitory avoidance training protects against the amnesic effect of p-chloroamphetamine.The contribution of acetylcholine (ACh) to memory processing is well documented, but it has been proposed that it is not necessary for memory consolidation after an enhanced learning experience. It has been suggested that serotonin (5-HT) interacts with ACh during memory consolidation, although the nature of this interaction is unknown in the case of strong learning. As an initial approach to the study of these interactions, we determined whether training of inhibitory avoidance using relatively high aversive stimulation protects against the typical retention deficits produced by pre-training administration of the 5-HT releaser p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). Rats were trained after intraperitoneal administration of PCA or isotonic saline, using 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 or 3.5 mA and retention of the task was measured 24 h later. A significant amnesic state was observed only in the PCA groups that had been trained with the two lower intensities. These results indicate that 5-HT systems behave similarly to ACh systems, in the sense that the amnesic effect produced by interference with their physiological activity may be cancelled when animals are submitted to an intense learning situation.",M5
12071674,"Effects of pretraining intrastriatal administration of p-chloroamphetamine on inhibitory avoidance.Pretraining systemic administration of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) consistently produces retention deficits of inhibitory avoidance. This drug causes a widespread acute release of serotonin from cerebral neuronal terminals, but it is not known where in the brain PCA exerts its disruptive cognitive effects. The present experiment was aimed at determining whether the striatum is a site of action of this drug. PCA (5 microg) was infused, bilaterally, into the striatum of rats at 30, 15, or 5 min before training of inhibitory avoidance, and retention of the task was measured 24 h later. An inversely related time-dependent deficit was found. Together with the results from appropriate control groups, this result strongly suggest that systemic PCA produces its reported cognitive effects, at least in part, through its pharmacological action within the striatum.",M5
11642332,"Effects of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin on hyperthermia and depletion of 5-HT in frontal cortex induced by a 5-HT releasing drug, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) in mice.Effects of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin on hyperthermia and depletion of 5-HT induced by the 5-HT-releasing drug, p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) were investigated. Ritanserin significantly suppressed PCA-induced hyperthermia in mice. PCA elicited decreases in 5-HT levels in the mouse frontal cortex. 5-HT reduction elicited by PCA was also attenuated by pretreatment with ritanserin. Since hyperthermia facilitates neurotoxicity induced by amphetamine analogue, ritanserin may inhibit PCA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity by inhibiting hyperthermia.",M5
11958842,"Partial denervation of the locus coeruleus projections by treatment with the selective neurotoxin DSP-4 potentiates the long-term effect of parachloroamphetamine on 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism in the rat.Pretreatment with N-2-chloroethyl-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), a neurotoxin highly selective for the locus coeruleus (LC) projections, has recently been found to increase the vulnerability of dopaminergic nerve terminals to their selective neurotoxins. In the present study, combined treatment with a selective serotonergic (5-HT-ergic) neurotoxin parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) at low doses (1 or 2 mg/kg) and a low dose of DSP-4 (10 mg/kg) led to larger decreases in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in several brain regions than with either toxin alone. A reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) turnover was observed only after the combined treatment with low doses of DSP-4 and PCA. When DSP-4 (10 mg/kg) was administered 2 months before PCA (2 mg/kg), the effect of PCA on cortical 5-HT levels was augmented, as was the effect on cortical and hypothalamic 5-HIAA levels. Conclusively, after limited alterations in the LC projections, there is an enhanced sensitivity of 5-HT-ergic nerve terminals to PCA.",M5
11251392,"Specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced decreases in lymphocyte activity require endogenous serotonin release.OBJECTIVES: We have previously reported that acute administration of the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, resulted in a decrease in mitogen-induced blood lymphocyte proliferation. The present studies further examine the specificity of this response to serotonin reuptake systems and the potential role of endogenous serotonin in mediating these effects. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated intraperitoneally with the SSRIs, fluoxetine (6-10 mg/kg) or sertraline (20 mg/kg), dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, GBR 12909 and desipramine, respectively (6 mg/kg) or the serotonin precursor, 5-hydoxytryptophan (5-HTP, 50 mg/kg) 2 h prior to sacrifice. The serotonin-depleting agents, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 2 x 200 mg/kg) or the serotonin-lesioning agent, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 2 x 10 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 5-7 days prior to fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) administration. RESULTS: Unlike the SSRIs, which significantly suppressed lymphocyte proliferation responses, selective norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake inhibition had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation. Elevation of extracellular serotonin levels with the serotonin precursor, 5-HTP, resulted in a similar decrease in lymphocyte proliferation as that seen with SSRI administration. Conversely, decreases in endogenous serotonin following PCA or PCPA treatment prevented the fluoxetine-induced decreases in lymphocyte proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that decreases in mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation following acute fluoxetine administration were due to elevations in extracellular serotonin following reuptake inhibition.",M5
11311884,"Chronic variable stress and partial 5-HT denervation by parachloroamphetamine treatment in the rat: effects on behavior and monoamine neurochemistry.Chronic variable stress (CVS) and manipulations of 5-HT-ergic neurotransmission are increasingly used as animal models of depression. In the present study, CVS for 2 weeks and a partial lesion of 5-HT projections by a small dose of parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 2 mg/kg) were applied independently or in combination. CVS reduced significantly the gain in body weight and increased the number of defecations in the open field test. PCA reduced body weight only within the first 24 h after its administration. Consumption of sucrose solution and its preference to water in non-deprived rats were significantly higher in PCA-pretreated rats 2 weeks after CVS compared to control animals. In the forced swimming test, both PCA and CVS treatments reduced immobility on the first but not the second session. Both treatments reduced significantly the time rats spent in social interaction. CVS also elicited an increase in the weight of the right adrenal, but this effect was not present in the PCA-pretreated group. PCA reduced 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and septum by approximately 20%. CVS increased HVA levels in the frontal cortex. Applied together, PCA pretreatment and CVS increased dopamine turnover in the frontal cortex. Conclusively, this study has provided evidence that chronic variable stress, which elicited expected physiological and neurochemical changes, does not reduce sucrose intake or preference in non-deprived animals, but, instead, may increase it after partial 5-HT-ergic denervation; and that partial 5-HT-ergic denervation by a low dose PCA treatment has a long-lasting effect on forced swimming and social behavior similar to chronic stress.",M5
11114483,"Differential sensitivities to the lethal, but not the neurotoxic, effects of p-chloroamphetamine in inbred rat strains.The Lewis, Fischer 344, Brown Norway, Spontaneously Hypertensive, and Wistar-Kyoto inbred rat strains were, respectively, compared for the lethal and neurotoxic effects of acute p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.). The lethal properties of the amphetamine were recorded within 24 h after its administration whereas neurotoxicity (as assessed by frontocortical 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake and 5-HT transporter binding assays) was analyzed 1 week after PCA administration. Preliminary experiments indicated that neither the rapid hyperlocomotor and/or the hypoexploratory effect of PCA nor the in vitro potency of PCA to inhibit frontocortical [(3)H]5-HT reuptake varied between strains. On the other hand, strain differences were observed with respect to the rapid fatal effects of the 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of PCA administration. Lastly, frontocortical [(3)H]5-HT reuptake and [(3)H]citalopram binding at 5-HT transporters diminished in a dose-dependent, but strain-independent, manner 1 week after the acute injection of PCA. This study reveals an independency between the mechanisms underlying the fatal effects of PCA on the one hand, and the long-term damaging effects of PCA on serotonergic neurons on the other hand.",M5
11125840,"Characterization of p-chloroamphetamine-induced penile erection and ejaculation in anesthetized rats.Methodological shortcomings present in elicitation of male sexual reflexes in anesthetized animals. The present study has demonstrated, however, that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), an indirect serotonin (5-HT) agonist, elicited simultaneously both penile erection and ejaculation in anesthetized rats. PCA (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) caused an intermittent cluster of genital responses consisting of penile erection, glans erections, and penile cups, which closely resembles the response observed during the ex copula tests in unanesthetized rats. Measurements of intracavernous penile pressure showed that rhythmic changes in penile pressure were produced by PCA, together with glans erections and penile cups. PCA also caused a frequent ejaculations and the weighing of ejaculate accumulated over 0.5 hr was increased in a bell-shaped pattern, and the maximum effect was observed at 5.0 mg/kg. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, a serotonin (5-HT)-synthesis inhibitor, significantly inhibited the expression of PCA-induced penile erection and ejaculation, while acute spinal transection at thoracic level did not affect the sexual responses. These results indicate that PCA-induced penile erection and ejaculation in anesthetized rats are mainly produced by the release of 5-HT, which is limited to the lower spinal cord and/or the peripheral sites. Furthermore, the sexual responses can be easily and reliably elicited by administration of PCA, which may be useful for the study of the mechanisms underlying male sexual functions.",M5
11018795,"Serotonin 2A and 2C receptor biosynthesis in the rodent striatum during postnatal development: mRNA expression and functional linkage to neuropeptide gene regulation.The present study was designed to determine if there are region-specific differences in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and 5-HT receptor expression that may limit the stimulatory effects of the 5-HT releaser p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) on striatal neuropeptide gene expression to the posterior striatum (P-STR) during postnatal maturation. Sprague-Dawley rat brains from postnatal days (PND) 1-35 were processed for 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization and monoamine analysis by HPLC. Within the P-STR, 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA expression reached young adult (PND 35) levels by PND 3, while levels in the A-STR were significantly less (range: 1.43 +/- 0.219-6. 36 +/- 0.478) than P-STR (5.36 +/- 0.854-12.11 +/- 1.08) at each respective age throughout the time course. 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA expression reached young adult levels at PND 7 in the A-STR and by PND 3 in the P-STR. At each PND age 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA levels within the P-STR were significantly less (6.23 +/- 1.02-12.32 +/- 0.427) than the A-STR (7.31 +/- 1.65-26.84 +/- 2.24). 5-HT content increased across the developmental time course within the P-STR (5.01 +/- 0.327-15.7 +/- 1.03 ng/mg protein) and A-STR (2.97 +/- 0. 223-11.2 +/- 0.701 ng/mg protein). Four hours following injection (i. p.) of pCA (10 mg/kg), preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA levels increased 89% in the P-STR but not the anterior (A-STR) striatum of the 3-week-old rat, which were prevented by preinjection (30 min, i.p.) of the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist ritanserin (1 mg/kg). Together, these data suggest that faster maturity of 5-HT(2A) receptor expression in the P-STR may be sufficient to convey the region-specific acute stimulatory effects of pCA on PPT mRNA transcription in the developing rodent striatum. These results provide further evidence that the influence of 5-HT on neuropeptide gene expression is far stronger in caudal vs. rostral striatal regions during postnatal development.",M5
11019904,"Interrelationships of GABAergic, serotoninergic and excitatory amino acid systems in its regulatory effect on prolactin secretion in prepubertal rats.GABAergic, serotoninergic and excitatory amino acid systems (EAAs) regulate the prolactin (PROL) secretion in prepubertal female rats. The aim of the present paper was to determine the interrelationships of these systems on the control of this pituitary hormone. It was carried out through the following scheme: 1. The participation of the EAAs and serotonin in the effect of GABAergic system on PROL release, determined by evaluating the GABA A and GABA B receptor agonists. It was carried out on animals that were previously treated with AAEs receptor antagonist or p-chlorophenylamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), this one depleting serotonin in the hypothalamus. 2. The participation of GABAergic system in the effect of serotonin and EAAs systems, determined by the evaluation of the effects of EAAs receptor agonists and of 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor. With this purpose the rats were previously treated with GABA A and GABA B receptor antagonists. 3. The interrelationships between the EAAs and the serotoninergic systems in the control of PROL secretion, determined (a) by using EAAs agonists (in rats depleted of serotonin by PCA) and (b) using EAAs antagonists (in rats treated with 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor). The administration of GABAergic agonists significantly increased PROL secretion in prepubertal female rats. Neither EAAs antagonists nor the depletion of serotonin in the brain, modified the stimulatory effects of the GABAergic system on PROL levels. This is a clear indication that the activity of the GABAergic system is independent of the serotoninergic and of the EAAs system effects on the pituitary hormone. The EAAs neurotransmitter system agonists significantly increase PROL levels. This effect was blocked by the GABAergic system antagonists but was not modified by serotonin depletion. Taking into account these facts it may be considered that the GABAergic system is involved in the stimulatory effect of EAAs on PROL secretion, this effect being independent of the serotoninergic system. 5-HTP significantly increased PROL plasma levels, and this effect was modified neither by the GABAergic nor by the EAAs receptor antagonists. These results indicate that the stimulatory effect of serotonin on PROL release is independent of the GABAergic and EAAs systems. In conclusion it may be considered that in prepubertal female rats, the GABAergic and serotoninergic systems stimulate PROL secretion by independent mechanisms that do not include EAAs. On the other hand, the effects of EAAs neurotransmission are exerted via the GABAergic system.",M5
10999445,"Radix Angelica Sinensis extracts ameliorate scopolamine- and cycloheximide-induced amnesia, but not p-chloroamphetamine-induced amnesia in rats.The effects of the methanolic extract of Radix Angelica Sinensis (Umbellifera) (abbreviated as RAS extract) and n-hexane fraction of RAS extract (RAS(H) fraction) on the various drugs-induced amnesia in rats were studied by using passive avoidance task. RAS extract (1 g/kg) significantly prolonged the shortened step-through latency induced by SCOP and CXM, but not <e>PCA</e>. Furthermore, RAS(H) fraction (1 g/kg) also significantly prolonged the shortened step-through latency induced by SCOP and CXM but not PCA. RAS extract at any dose alone did not influence the step-through latency in the training trial produced by non-shocked rats, but it plus PCA prolonged the latency compared with PCA alone. However, RAS(H) fraction (1 g/kg) prolonged the latency in the training trial produced by non-shocked rats, but it plus any induced drugs did not differ from any induced drugs alone. These results suggest that the attenuating effects of RAS extract on the various drugs-induced amnesia were related to the memory processes. n-Hexane fraction of RAS extract might be one of the active fractions of RAS extract in the treatment of amnesia.",M5
11000480,"Stimulated serotonin release from hyperinnervated terminals subsequent to neonatal dopamine depletion regulates striatal tachykinin, but not enkephalin gene expression.Dopamine (DA) depletion in neonatal rodents results in depressed tachykinin and elevated enkephalin gene expression in the adult striatum (STR). Concurrently, serotonin (5-HT) fibers sprout to hyperinnervate the DA-depleted anterior striatum (A-STR). The present study was designed to determine if increased 5-HT release from sprouted terminals influences dysregulated preprotachykinin (PPT) and preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA expression in the DA-depleted STR. Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups received bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of vehicle or the DA neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 100 microg). Two months later, rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or the acute 5-HT releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 10 mg/kg). Rats were killed 4 h later and striata processed for monoamine content by HPLC-ED and mRNA expression by in situ hybridization within specific subregions of the A-STR and posterior striatum (P-STR). 6-OHDA treatment severely (&gt;98%) reduced striatal DA levels, while 5-HT content in the A-STR was significantly elevated (doubled), indicative of 5-HT hyperinnervation. Following 6-OHDA, PPT mRNA levels were depressed 60-66% across three subregions of the A-STR and 52-59% across two subregions of the P-STR, while PPE mRNA expression was elevated in both the A-STR (50-62%) and P-STR (55-82%). PCA normalized PPT mRNA levels in all regions of the DA-depleted A-STR and P-STR, yet did not alter PPE levels in either dorsal central or medial regions from 6-OHDA alone, but reduced PPE to control levels in the dorsal lateral A-STR. These data indicate that increased 5-HT neurotransmission, following neonatal 6-OHDA treatment, primarily influences PPT-containing neurons of the direct striatal output pathway.",M5
10869495,"Neurochemical changes in brain serotonin neurons in immature and adult offspring prenatally exposed to cocaine.The present study investigates the age-dependent effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on changes in the neurochemical and functional status of brain serotonin neurons. Pregnant rats were administered either saline or (-)cocaine HCl (15 mg/kg, subcutaneously), twice daily from gestational days 13 through 20. Neurochemical changes in frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and midbrain of prepubescent and adult offspring were determined by measuring: (1) the content of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and (2) the ability of the serotonin releasing drug p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) to reduce brain serotonin levels. Brain catecholamine content was determined in progeny for comparative purposes. Prior to maturation, prenatal exposure to cocaine did not alter basal levels of brain 5-HT or 5-HIAA in any brain region examined. However, in adult progeny prenatally exposed to cocaine, basal 5-HT content was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex (-32%) and hippocampus (-40%), suggesting maturation-dependent effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on brain 5-HT neurons. Consistent with the maturational onset of changes in 5-HT, striatal dopamine was significantly reduced (-10%) by prenatal exposure to cocaine only in adult offspring. Reductions in 5-HT in most brain regions, produced by pharmacological challenge with p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), were comparable in prenatal saline versus cocaine offspring. One notable exception was the markedly greater reduction (-40%) in 5-HT in the midbrain of immature offspring prenatally exposed to cocaine, suggesting alterations in midbrain 5-HT neurons prior to maturation. Overall, these data demonstrate prenatal cocaine exposure produces region-specific changes in 5-HT neurons in offspring with some deficits occurring only following maturation.",M5
10973623,"Involvement of the 5-HT(2) receptor in hyperthermia induced by p-chloroamphetamine, a serotonin-releasing drug in mice.The effects of a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)-releasing drug, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), on body temperature were investigated in mice. PCA induced hyperthermia in mice. PCA-induced hyperthermia was inhibited by the 5-HT(2A/2B/2C) receptor antagonist, 4-isopropyl-7-methyl-9-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-propoxycarbonyl)-4,6A,7 , 8,9,10,10A-octahydro-indolo[4,3-FG]quinolone maleate (LY53857). The 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, ketanserin, reduced the PCA-induced hyperthermia, while the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, N-3-pyridinyl-3,5-dihydro-5-methyl-benzo[1,2-b:4, 5-b']dipyrrole-1(2H)-carboxamide (SB 206553), enhanced it. LY 53857, ketanserin and SB 206553 did not affect hyperactivity in mice treated with PCA. These results suggest that PCA-induced hyperthermia in mice is mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptors and is not related to changes in locomotor activity.",M5
10800921,"Effect of p-chloroamphetamine on 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 serotonin receptor expression in rat brain.The aim of this study was to investigate if p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), which is neurotoxic to serotonin (5-HT) nerve terminals, was able to induce, like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a region-specific regulation of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression. The effect of PCA on the expression of 5-HT7 receptors, which share some pharmacological properties with 5-HT1A receptors, was comparatively studied. PCA (2 x 5 mg/kg) produced a lasting depletion of 5-HT content in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the maximal 5-HT depletion was found on day 21 (-70%), whereas in the cortex, the highest 5-HT depletion was found on day 14 (-73%), with a partial but significant recovery on day 21. At the latter time point, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was increased by 80% in the cortex and decreased by 50% in the hippocampus. The 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was also enhanced after exposure to PCA of rat cortical but not of hippocampal primary cultures. In regard to 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression, the most remarkable change after PCA was the great increase (+200%) in the brain-stem. Binding studies to 5-HT1A receptors matched the changes in receptor mRNA expression. Gel shift assays revealed enhanced nuclear protein binding to the KB sequence with use of cortical but not hippocampal extracts of PCA-treated rats. Overall, the data show region-specific changes in 5-HT receptor-type expression that may not be entirely dependent on the neurotoxic effect of PCA on 5-HT terminals.",M5
10869387,"Transporter-mediated release: a superfusion study on human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the human serotonin transporter.HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) were grown on coverslips, preincubated with [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and superfused. Substrates of the hSERT [e.g., p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>)], increased the basal efflux of [(3)H]5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner. 5-HT reuptake blockers (e.g., imipramine, paroxetine) also raised [(3)H]5-HT efflux, reaching approximately one-third of the maximal effect of the hSERT substrates. In uptake experiments, both groups of substances inhibited [(3)H]5-HT uptake. Using the low-affinity substrate [(3)H]N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) to label the cells in superfusion experiments, reuptake inhibitors failed to enhance efflux. Similar results were obtained using human placental choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells that constitutively express the hSERT at a low level. By contrast, PCA raised [(3)H]MPP(+) efflux in both types of cells, and its effect was inhibited by paroxetine. The addition of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 microM) to the superfusion buffer enhanced basal efflux of [(3)H]5-HT-loaded hSERT cells by approximately 2-fold; the effect of PCA (10 microM) was strongly augmented by ouabain, whereas the effect of imipramine was not. The Na(+)/H(+) ionophore monensin (10 microM) also augmented the effect of PCA on efflux of [(3)H]5-HT as well as on efflux of [(3)H]MPP(+). In [(3)H]5-HT-labeled cells, the combination of imipramine and monensin raised [(3)H]5-HT efflux to a greater extent than either of the two substances alone. In [(3)H]MPP(+)-labeled cells, imipramine had no effect on its own and fully reversed the effect of monensin. The results suggest that the [(3)H]5-HT efflux caused by uptake inhibitors is entirely due to interrupted high-affinity reuptake, which is ongoing even under superfusion conditions.",M5
10684896,"Dual serotonin (5-HT) projections to the nucleus accumbens core and shell: relation of the 5-HT transporter to amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated as mediating the rewarding effects of stimulant drugs; however, recent studies suggest that 5-HT release may also contribute. In an effort to assess the role of 5-HT in drug-mediated reward, this study analyzed the serotonergic innervation of NAc using immunocytochemistry for 5-HT and the 5-HT transporter (SERT). We report that in control rats the NAc receives two distinct types of 5-HT axons that differ in regional distribution, morphology, and SERT expression. Most regions of the NAc are innervated by thin 5-HT axons that express SERT, but in the caudal NAc shell nearly all 5-HT axons lack SERT and have large spherical varicosities. Two weeks after methamphetamine or p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) treatment, most 5-HT axons in dorsal striatum and NAc have degenerated; however, the varicose axons in the shell appear intact. These drug-resistant 5-HT axons that lack SERT densely innervate the caudal one-third of the accumbens shell, the same location where dopamine axons are spared after methamphetamine. Moreover, 4 hr after PCA, the varicose axons in the caudal shell retain prominent stores of 5-HT, whereas 5-HT axons in the rest of the NAc are depleted of neurotransmitter. The results demonstrate that two functionally different 5-HT projections innervate separate regions of the NAc and that selective vulnerability to amphetamines may result from differential expression of SERT. We postulate that action potentials conducted from the raphe nuclei can release 5-HT throughout the NAc, whereas transporter-mediated release induced by stimulant drugs is more restricted and unlikely to occur in the caudal NAc shell.",M5
10693966,"Characterization of carrier-mediated efflux in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the rat serotonin transporter: a superfusion study.Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the rat plasmalemmal serotonin transporter (rSERT) were incubated with 5-[3H]hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) and superfused. Substrates of the rSERT, such as p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) or methylenedioxymethamphetamine, concentration-dependently increased basal efflux of [3H]5-HT. 5-HT reuptake blockers (e.g., imipramine, citalopram) also caused an enhancement of [3H]5-HT efflux, reaching about half the maximal effect of the rSERT substrates. In uptake experiments, both groups of substances concentration-dependently inhibited 5-HT uptake. EC50 values obtained in superfusion experiments significantly correlated with IC50 values from uptake studies (r2 = 0.92). Addition of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 microM) to or the omission of K+ from the superfusion buffer accelerated basal efflux. The effect of PCA (10 microM) was markedly enhanced by both measures, whereas the effect of uptake inhibitors remained unchanged. When [3H]MPP+, a substrate with low affinity for the rSERT, was used instead of [3H]5-HT for labeling the cells, uptake inhibitors failed to augment efflux. By contrast, PCA accelerated [3H]MPP+ efflux, and its effect was strongly enhanced in the presence of ouabain. The results suggest that the [3H]5-HT efflux caused by substrates of rSERT is carrier-mediated, whereas efflux induced by uptake inhibitors is a consequence of interrupted high-affinity reuptake that is ongoing even under superfusion conditions.",M5
10663425,"Blockade of muscarinic, rather than nicotinic, receptors impairs attention, but does not interact with serotonin depletion.RATIONALE: The cholinergic system is considered to be essential for attention and the degeneration of the cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with the cognitive decline seen in AD patients. The serotonergic system also degenerates in AD, but its role in the modulation of cognitive functions, especially attention, is somewhat unclear. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated possible differences between cholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptor mediated mechanisms, the role of serotonin (5-HT) and the interaction between the cholinergic and serotonergic systems in the modulation of attention and response control. METHODS: The influences of cholinergic receptor blockade and 5-HT lesions on the performance of rats in the five-choice serial reaction time task were assessed. The 5-HT lesions were neurochemically verified. RESULTS: The neurochemical analysis indicated that the levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were reduced quite specifically in the hippocampi, parieto-occipital and frontal cortices, and in the striatum of both p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) and 5, 7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) lesioned rats. The behavioural results showed that the pCA lesion caused a transient increase in impulsivity whereas the 5,7-DHT lesion temporarily reduced the motor activity and slightly impaired choice accuracy. Furthermore, the blockade of central muscarinic receptors by scopolamine (0.075 and 0. 150 mg/kg), but not nicotinic receptors by mecamylamine (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg), impaired the choice accuracy, whereas the blockade of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors interfered with motor activity, though possibly via peripheral mechanisms. Interestingly, mecamylamine (3.0 mg/kg) reduced impulsivity, whereas scopolamine slightly increased it. Serotonergic lesions did not make the rats more susceptible to the effects of cholinolytics on choice accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: 5-HT system is not essential for the modulation of attention, but it is important in the modulation of response control. Central muscarinic receptors are important in the modulation of attention, whereas central nicotinic receptors may be more essential in response control. The results do not support there being an interaction between the serotonergic and the cholinergic systems in the modulation of attention.",M5
10667986,"Serotonin depletion and barrel cortex development: impact of growth impairment vs. serotonin effects on thalamocortical endings.Converging evidence supports a role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in barrel cortex development. Systemic administration of 5-HT-depleting drugs reduces cross-sectional whisker barrel areas in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) of neonatal rats. Here we assess the relative impact on barrel pattern formation of (i) 5-HT depletion and (ii) decreased brain growth, which is often associated with pharmacological 5-HT depletion, by comparing the effects of 5-HT-depleting drugs with those of reduced protein intake. Left hemisphere 5-HT levels in the SSC and right hemisphere whisker barrel areas were assessed at postnatal day 6 (P6) in the same animal following injection of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) at P0. Both drugs significantly reduced cortical 5-HT content and mean barrel areas at P6, but also body and brain growth. Differences in brain weight accounted for 84.4% of the variance in barrel size, with negligible contributions by cortical 5-HT content. PCPA-treated animals sacrificed at P14 yielded similar trends, albeit less pronounced. Finally, reduced protein intake resulted in lower body weight and cortical 5-HT levels at P6, but yielded no change in brain weight or mean barrel area. Barrel formation therefore appears markedly less sensitive to 5-HT depletion per se than to drug-induced growth impairment.",M5
10632606,"BDNF promotes the regenerative sprouting, but not survival, of injured serotonergic axons in the adult rat brain.Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has trophic effects on serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the adult brain and can prevent the severe loss of cortical 5-HT axons caused by the neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). However, it has not been determined whether BDNF promotes the survival of 5-HT axons during PCA-insult or facilitates their regenerative sprouting after injury. We show here that BDNF fails to protect most 5-HT axons from PCA-induced degeneration. Instead, chronic BDNF infusions markedly stimulate the sprouting of both intact and PCA-lesioned 5-HT axons, leading to a hyperinnervation at the neocortical infusion site. BDNF treatment promoted the regrowth of 5-HT axons when initiated up to a month after PCA administration. The sprouted axons persisted in cortex for at least 5 weeks after terminating exogenous BDNF delivery. BDNF also encouraged the regrowth of the 5-HT plexus in the hippocampus, but only in those lamina where 5-HT axons normally ramify. In addition, intracortical BDNF infusions induced a sustained local activation of the TrkB receptor. The dose-response profiles for BDNF to stimulate 5-HT sprouting and Trk signaling were remarkably similar, suggesting a physiological link between the two events; both responses were maximal at intermediate doses of BDNF but declined at higher doses ( inverted-U-shaped  dose-response curves). Underlying the downregulation of the Trk signal with excessive BDNF was a decline in full-length TrkB protein, but not truncated TrkB protein or TrkB mRNA levels. Thus, BDNF-TrkB signaling does not protect 5-HT neurons from axonal injury, but has a fundamental role in promoting the structural plasticity of these neurons in the adult brain.",M5
10649830,"Multiple 5-HT receptors in passive avoidance: comparative studies of p-chloroamphetamine and 8-OH-DPAT.The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of multiple 5-HT receptors in passive avoidance (PA) with a focus on 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. Because increases in 5-HT transmission result in concomitant multiple 5-HT receptor activation, the effects of the 5-HT releasing compound p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) were compared with those of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT in the rat. In addition, some results with the nonselective 5-HT2C/2B/1B receptor agonist mCPP are presented. When injected before PA training, 8-OH-DPAT, mCPP, and PCA produced a dose-related impairment of the 24-hour retention. The crucial involvement of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the action of 8-OH-DPAT was confirmed. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists WAY 100635 and (-)-pindolol blocked the PA deficit by 8-OH-DPAT. The impairment of PA caused by PCA was attenuated by WAY 100635 and (-)-pindolol, suggesting an involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor. In contrast, the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were of negligible importance in the 24-hour retention deficit induced by PCA. However, the ability of the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist Ro 60-0491 to block the inhibitory effects of mCPP indicated an important regulatory role of the 5-HT2C receptor in PA. The nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist methiothepin attenuated the PA deficit by PCA but lacked activity versus 8-OH-DPAT. These data provide evidence for the hypothesis that, in addition to the 5-HT1A receptor, other 5-HT receptor subtypes are involved in the inhibitory actions of PCA. Importantly, changes in dopamine transmission seemed not to contribute to the PA impairment by PCA. The behavioral alterations caused by the drug treatments at the time of PA training could not be related to the subsequent retention performance. In conclusion, multiple 5-HT receptors are involved in PA with roles that probably differ at various stages of information processing. These findings also suggest that there probably exists a functional distinction between 5-HT receptor subtypes in different types of aversive learning.",M5
10343167,"Effects of serotonin depletion by p-chlorophenylalanine, p-chloroamphetamine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine on central dopaminergic neurons: focus on tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons and serum prolactin.Three serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxins, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 125 and 250 mg/kg, i.p.), p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 200 microg/rat, i.c.v.) were used to examine whether depletion of central 5-HT has an effect on central dopaminergic (DA) neuronal activities or on prolactin (PRL) secretion. Adult ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats primed with estrogen (polyestradiol phosphate, 0.1 mg/rat, s.c.) were treated with one of three neurotoxins and then decapitated in the morning after 3-7 days. Blood sample and brain tissues were collected. The acute effect of PCA (from 30 to 180 min) was also determined. The concentrations of 5-HT, DA and their metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, in the median eminence, striatum and nucleus accumbens were determined by HPLC-electrochemical detection. All three toxins significantly depleted central 5-HT stores by 11-20%. Except for PCPA, neither PCA nor 5,7-DHT had any significant effect on basal DA neuronal activities or PRL secretion. PCA also exhibited an acute effect on the release and reuptake of 5-HT and DA. In summary, depletion of central 5-HT stores to a significant extent for 3-7 days did not seem to affect basal DA neuronal activity and PRL secretion.",M5

Intraperitoneal injection of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), releasing central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from serotonergic nerve terminals, inhibited ingestion of the sucrose solution. Significant inhibition of sucrose intake by PCA was observed at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg dose in a bottle intake test, and at 5.0 mg/kg dose in an intraoral intake test. These findings suggested that 1.25 and 5.0 mg/kg of PCA suppressed appetitive ingestive behavior and consummatory ingestive behavior in male rats, respectively.",M5
10320763,"Synaptogenesis in the postnatal rat fascia dentata is influenced by 5-HT1a receptor activation.Neonatal serotonin (5-HT) depletion or 5-HT1a receptor blockade results in a significant and permanent reduction in the number of dentate granule cell dendritic spines. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the loss of spines was accompanied by a reduction in molecular layer synaptic profile density. Rat pups were treated with parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), 5,7-DHT or the 5-HT1a receptor antagonist NAN-190. The synaptic profile density (profiles/100 microm2) of the dentate molecular layer was estimated on P14, P21 and P60. Molecular layer synaptic profile density the was significantly reduced in each treatment group on P14 and P21. By P60, the NAN-190 and PCA groups had reached control values, but the 5,7-DHT group remained significantly lower than control. The most dramatic changes were observed among synapses terminating on dendritic spines. Numbers of profiles forming simple spine contacts were significantly reduced by all treatments at P14 and P21, but returned to normal by P60 in the PCA and NAN-190 groups. Simple spine synapses in the 5,7-DHT group remained significantly below control, but numbers of complex spine synapses were higher than either control or the other treatment groups at each age. These results indicate that the loss of dendritic spines observed following 5-HT depletion or 5-HT1a antagonist treatment is accompanied by a decrease in synaptic profile density. This effect appears to be a retardation of synaptogenesis since recovery occurs once 5-HT1a receptor activity resumes. Data from the 5,7-DHT group shows that complex spine synapse formation may represent an effort to attain some degree of functional compensation when synaptogenesis is slowed.",M5

Granule cell population EPSP and spike responses were in the normal range for both PCA and 5,7-DHT groups. However, the degree of paired pulse facilitation was reduced in both of these groups relative to control, reflecting a diminished synaptic drive.

10082640,"5-HT1A receptors modulate the consolidation of learning in normal and cognitively impaired rats.Attempts were made to further analyze the role of 5-HT1A receptors in consolidation of learning by evaluating the role of these receptors in cognitively normal and impaired animals. The effects of post-training administration of 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, WAY 100135, WAY 100635, and S-UH-301, plus the cholinergic and glutamatergic antagonists, scopolamine and dizolcipine, respectively, were determined using an autoshaping learning task. The results showed that 8-OH-DPAT increased the number of conditioned responses, whereas WAY100135, WAY100635, and S-UH-301, and the 5-HT depleter, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), had no effect. PCA did not change the silent properties of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. PCA, WAY100635, and S-UH-301, but not GR127935 (a 5-HT1B/1D-receptor antagonist) or MDL100907 (a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist), reversed the effect to 8-OH-DPAT. Ketanserin (a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist) and ondansetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist), at a dose that increased the conditioned responses by itself, reversed the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. Moreover, 8-OH-DPAT or S-UH-301 reversed the learning deficit induced by scopolamine and dizocilpine whereas WAY100635 reversed the effect of scopolamine only. These data confirm a role for presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors during the consolidation of learning and support the hypothesis that serotonergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic systems interact in cognitively impaired animals.",M5

Administration of the serotonin2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, blocked the pCA-induced increase in PPT mRNA levels. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine pretreatment (alpha-MT, to reduce dopamine transmission) inhibited the pCA-induced increase in PPT mRNA levels. These results indicate that the pCA-induced increase in striatal PPT mRNA expression is mediated by serotonin2A/2C receptors but also requires dopamine tone.",M5
9884092,"Brain-to-blood partition and in vivo inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake and quipazine-mediated behaviour of nefazodone and its main active metabolites in rodents.The brain/plasma partition of nefazodone, hydroxynefazodone (OHNFZ) and m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP) and their antagonism of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>)-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depletion and quipazine-induced head twitches were compared in rodents. Nefazodone (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) rapidly entered the brain but concentrations were exceeded by mCPP, the metabolic ratio being 47 and 10 in the mouse and rat respectively. OHNFZ was detectable in plasma but never in brain. Brain concentrations of OHNFZ in the mouse (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) were less than 10% of those in plasma, confirming a poor blood-brain barrier penetration. Concentrations of its metabolite mCPP were similar to those after 5 mg kg(-1)(i.p.) mCPP. In the mouse, nefazodone (30 mg kg(-1)) antagonized the 5-HT depleting effect of PCA 2 h after dosing, when it had disappeared from brain but when mCPP concentrations were similar to those after 5 mg kg(-1) (i.p.) mCPP. However, mCPP antagonized PCA less than nefazodone. In the rat, nefazodone pretreatment (30 mg kg(-1), 15 min) prevented (97% of inhibition) quipazine-induced head twitches. The effect was weaker (65% of inhibition) but significant when only mCPP was detected in brain. Analysis of brain concentrations of the two compounds after their ED50 against quipazine indicated that both contributed to the effect, although nefazodone was more active than mCPP in terms of concentrations required to obtain a comparable reduction of twitches. These findings show that mCPP concentrates in the brain following injection of nefazodone and may play a role in preventing quipazine-induced behaviour and PCA-induced 5-HT depletion. In contrast OHNFZ poorly enters the brain and its in vivo activity is mostly due to its biotransformation to mCPP.",M5
9974171,"Differential sensitivity of tachykinin vs. enkephalin gene expression in the posterior striatum in response to acute p-chloroamphetamine treatment during postnatal development.The acute effects of the monoamine releaser p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) on preprotachykinin (PPT) and preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA expression in the anterior (A-STR) vs. posterior (P-STR) striatum were studied in rodents at postnatal days (PND) 10, 21 and 35. Northern analysis 4 h post-injection yielded no significant mRNA changes within the A-STR of any pCA group. However, significant increases (80-200% of saline control) in PPT mRNA levels occurred within the P-STR at all three postnatal ages. Interestingly, pCA did not increase PPE mRNA levels within the P-STR until PND 35 (150% of saline control). Such observation suggests that tachykinin neurons of the P-STR achieve an earlier monoamine-responsive signal transduction linkage to gene regulation as compared to enkephalin neurons. Given its predominance in the caudal regions of the striatum, 5-HT neurotransmission at the 5-HT2 receptor is suggested to play a central role in this mechanism.",M5
9346471,"p-Chloroamphetamine- and d-fenfluramine-induced brain serotonin release in experimental portal-systemic encephalopathy.Portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is associated with increased brain turnover of serotonin (5-HT) in vivo but the brain 5-HT output seems to be unaltered. Recent results suggest, however, that an augmented neocortical 5-HT release in experimental chronic PSE may prevail under certain conditions. In the present study, neocortical extracellular 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic-3-acid (5-HIAA) levels were measured in portacaval shunted (PCS) rats and sham-operated controls following local administration of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) and d-fenfluramine (dFEN), two specific 5-HT releasing agents. The basal neocortical extracellular 5-HT concentrations were unaltered and the 5-HIAA levels were elevated in experimental PSE, supporting an unchanged brain 5-HT output despite elevated brain 5-HT metabolism. Perfusion with pCA or dFEN (5 microM; one 20-min pulse) produced marked increases in brain 5-HT release both in PCS and sham-operated rats compared with corresponding basal values. While no difference in the 5-HT response to dFEN administration was seen between sham (5-HT levels increased by 330%) and PCS (500%) rats, a clear difference (p&lt;0.05) in the brain 5-HT output was observed between the two experimental groups following pCA perfusion (sham, 1100% versus PCS, 1470%). These results support our previous contention of an enhanced neocortical 5-HT output in experimental chronic PSE under certain pharmacological conditions.",M5
9406960,"Evidence for 5-HT4 receptor involvement in the enhancement of acetylcholine release by p-chloroamphetamine in rat frontal cortex.The roles of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT receptor subtypes in regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in frontal cortex of conscious rats were examined using a microdialysis technique. Systemic administration (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) of the 5-HT-releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) elevated ACh output in a dose-dependent manner. Depletion of endogenous 5-HT by p-chlorophenylalanine significantly attenuated the facilitatory effect of PCA on ACh release. The PCA (3 mg/kg)-induced increase in ACh release was significantly inhibited by local application of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists RS23597 (50 microM) and GR113803 (1 microM), while the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100135 (10 mg/kg, i.p.; 100 microM), 5-HT(1A/1B)/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg, i.p.) and (-)-propranolol (150 microM), 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonist ritanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microM) and 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microM) failed to significantly modify the effect of PCA. These results suggest that PCA-induced enhancement of 5-HT transmission facilitates ACh release from rat frontal cortex at least in part through 5-HT4 receptors.",M5
9222545,"In vivo evidence for free radical involvement in the degeneration of rat brain 5-HT following administration of MDMA ('ecstasy') and p-chloroamphetamine but not the degeneration following fenfluramine.1. Administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy') to several species results in a long lasting neurotoxic degeneration of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurones in several regions of the brain. We have now investigated whether this degeneration is likely to be the result of free radical-induced damage. 2. Free radical formation can be assessed by measuring the formation of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA) from salicylic acid. An existing method involving implantation of a probe into the hippocampus and in vivo microdialysis was modified and validated. 3. Administration of MDMA (15 mg kg-1, i.p.) to Dark Agouti (DA) rats increased the formation of 2,3-DHBA (but not 2,5-DHBA) for at least 6 h. Seven days after this dose of MDMA, the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was reduced by over 50% in hippocampus, cortex and striatum, reflecting neurotoxic damage. There was no change in the concentration of dopamine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum. 4. p-Chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), another compound which produces a neurotoxic loss of cerebral 5-HT content, when given at a dose of 5 mg kg-1 also significantly increased the formation of 2.3-DHBA (but not 2,5-DHBA) in the dialysate for over 4.5 h. post-injection starting 2 h after treatment. 5. In contrast, fenfluramine administration (15 mg kg-1, i.p.) failed to increase the 2,3-DHBA or 2,5-DHBA concentration in the dialysate. A single fenfluramine injection nevertheless also markedly decreased the concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum seven days later. 6. When rats pretreated with fenfluramine (15 mg kg-1, i.p.) seven days earlier were given MDMA (15 mg kg-1, i.p.) no increase in 2,3-DHBA was seen in the dialysate from the hippocampal probe. This indicates that the increase in free radical formation following MDMA is occurring in 5-HT neurones which have been damaged by the prior fenfluramine injection. 7. Administration of the free radical scavenging agent alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN; 120 mg kg-1, i.p.) 10 min before and 120 min after an MDMA (15 mg kg-1, i.p.) injection prevented the acute rise in the 2,3-DHBA concentration in the dialysate and attenuated by 30% the long term damage to hippocampal 5-HT neurones (as indicated by a smaller MDMA-induced decrease in both the concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA and also the binding of [3H]-paroxetine). 8. These data indicate that a major mechanism by which MDMA and PCA induce damage to 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurones in rat brain is by increasing the formation of free radicals. These probably result from the degradation of catechol and quinone metabolites of these substituted amphetamines. In contrast, fenfluramine induces damage by another mechanism not involving free radicals; a proposal supported by some of our earlier indirect studies. 9. We suggest that these different modes of action render untenable the recent suggestion that MDMA will not be neurotoxic in humans because fenfluramine appears safe at clinical doses.",M5
9283711,"Carrier-dependent and Ca(2+)-dependent 5-HT and dopamine release induced by (+)-amphetamine, 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine and (+)-fenfluramine.1. The mechanism underlying 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and/or dopamine release induced by (+)-amphetamine ((+)-Amph), 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) and (+)-fenfluramine ((+)-Fen) was investigated in rat brain superfused synaptosomes preloaded with the 3H neurotransmitters. 2. Their rank order of potency for [3H]-5-HT-releasing activity was the same as for inhibition of 5-HT uptake (pCA &gt; or = MDMA &gt; or = (+)-Fen &gt; &gt; (+)-Amph). Similarly, their rank order as [3H]-dopamine releasers and dopamine uptake inhibitors was the same ((+)-Amph &gt; &gt; pCA = MDMA &gt; &gt; (+)-Fen). We also confirmed that the release induced by these compounds was prevented by selective transporter inhibitors (indalpine or nomifensine). 3. [3H]-5HT and/or [3H]-dopamine release induced by all these compounds was partially (31-80%), but significantly Ca(2+)-dependent. Lack of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter uptake mechanisms nor did it modify the carrier-dependent dopamine-induced [3H]-dopamine release. (+)-Amph-induced [3H]-dopamine release and pCA- and MDMA-induced [3H]-5-HT release were significantly inhibited by omega-agatoxin-IVA, a specific blocker of P-type voltage-operated Ca(2+)-channels, similar to the previous results on (+)-Fen-induced [3H]-5-HT release. 4. Methiothepin inhibited the Ca(2+)-dependent component of (+)-Amph-induced [3H]-dopamine release with high potency (70 nM), as previously found with (+)-Fen-induced [3H]-5-HT release. The inhibitory effect of methiothepin was not due to its effects as a transporter inhibitor or Ca(2+)-channel blocker and is unlikely to be due to its antagonist properties on 5-HT1/2, dopamine or any other extracellular receptor. 5. These results indicate that the release induced by these compounds is both 'carrier-mediated' and Ca(2+)-dependent (possibly exocytotic-like), with the specific carrier allowing the amphetamines to enter the synaptosome. The Ca(2+)-dependent release is mediated by Ca(2+)-influx (mainly through P-type Ca(2+)-channels), possibly triggered by the drug interacting with an unknown intracellular target, affected by methiothepin, common to both 5-HT and dopamine synaptosomes.",M5
9051258,"Effects of neonatal serotonin depletion on the development of rat dentate granule cells.The appearance of serotonergic (5-HT) neurons and projections early in central nervous system (CNS) development has resulted in the hypothesis that 5-HT is an important factor in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis. Studies of the effects of 5-HT on the development of molluscan and mammalian neurons in vitro support this hypothesis, but mammalian in vivo studies have produced equivocal results. The present study reinvestigated the role of 5-HT in CNS development using the dentate granule cell as a model. Dentate granule cells were chosen for this study of the effects of 5-HT depletion on neuronal development because they are generated in the early postnatal period. Thus, 5-HT depletion could be effected by the treatment of rat pups with either parachloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) thereby avoiding problems inherent in maternal treatment paradigms. The morphology of Neurobiotin-filled granule cells was studied on P14, P21, P60 and P120 (P0 = day of birth). The parameters measured were total dendritic length, number of dendritic segments and dendritic spine density (number of spines/50 microns dendritic length). Granule cells from vehicle-treated controls were similar to those previously reported in studies of normal granule cell development in all respects. In particular, the decrease in dendritic spine density from P14 to P120 observed in Golgi preparations was verified in our population of intracellularly filled granule cells. Transient depletion of 5-HT by neonatal PCA treatment resulted in a decrease dendritic length that was not statistically different from control values. However, dendritic spine density was reduced by about 27% at all ages studied. 5,7-DHT treatment produces a permanent, severe depletion of 5-HT. Spine densities in granule cells from 5,7-DHT-treated pups were also about 38% lower than controls. Total dendritic length in cells from 5,7-DHT-treated rats was reduced to a degree comparable to that observed in PCA-treated pups. The number of granule cell dendritic segments was also less than that observed in control and PCA-treated rats but this difference was not statistically significant. These observations suggest that reduction of 5-HT in the early postnatal period can result in changes in the morphology of dentate granule cells, particularly at the level of the synapse as reflected by the permanent reduction in synaptic spine density. The comparison of results from cases with permanent and transient reduction of 5-HT indicates that the developmental influence of 5-HT is most important during the first three postnatal weeks.",M5
9077568,"Effects of 5-HT4 receptor agonists and antagonists in learning.In the present work, the effects of pre- or post-training (ip) injection of BIMU1 and BIMU8 (5-HT4 agonists) were figured out in the autoshaping learning task. Furthermore, the post-training effects of these agonists after treatment with SDZ 205-557 and GR 125487D (5-HT4 antagonists) or p-Chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) were also explored. Animals were individually trained in a lever-press response on the autoshaping task and 24 hours later were tested. The results showed that pre-training injection of BIMU1 (5 20 mg/Kg) or BIMU8 (20 mg/Kg) increased the CR; in contrast, the post-training administration of BIMU1 (10-20 mg/Kg) or BIMU8 (5 and 20 mg/Kg) decreased it. Further experiments revealed that the post-training injections of SDZ 205-557 (1.0-10.0 mg/Kg) or GR 125487D (0.39-1.56 mg/Kg) by themselves did not alter the CR. When BIMU1 or BIMU8 was administered to rats pretreated with SDZ 205-557 (10 mg/Kg) or GR 125487D (0.78 mg/Kg), the decrement induced by 5-HT4 the agonists was reversed; in contrast, the administration of PCA failed to modify the CR or the agonist-induced responses. The findings showed that the pre-training stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors enhanced the acquisition of CR, while, post-training activation of 5-HT4 receptors, impaired the consolidation of learning. The latter effect was not altered by PCA pretreatment. The data show that 5-HT4 receptors are involved in the acquisition and consolidation of learning. It seems that postsynaptic 5-HT4 receptors are involved in the latter effect.",M5

The semen yielded by PCA-induced ejaculation from aged (75-week-old) rats had average sperm counts of 0.82 +/- 0.69 x 10(7), which were much lower than the average counts (9.42 +/- 1.65 x 10(7)) for semen spontaneously ejaculated by young adult rats (14 weeks old). However, 77.5% of the spermatozoa contained in the PCA-induced semen were rated as showing the most active movement.

The monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor L-deprenyl (2 mg/kg) given 4 hr before a nonneurotoxic dose of PCA (2 mg/kg) was shown not to alter the amount of [3H]paroxetine bound to serotonin (5-HT) uptake sites 7 days after treatment. L-Deprenyl 4 hr before a neurotoxic dose of PCA (10 mg/kg) did not change the acute hyperthermia. Further, neither L-deprenyl nor another selective MAO-B inhibitor, MDL-72,974 (1.25 mg/kg), given 30 min before or daily for 4 days before a single dose of PCA attenuated or potentiated the decrease in the number of [3H]paroxetine binding sites measured 7 days after PCA treatment. The combination of the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline (2.5 mg/kg) or a nonspecific dose of L-deprenyl (10 mg/kg) with the selective 5-HT releasing agent 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindan did not lead to changes in the levels of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid or dopamine 7 days after treatment. Finally, the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL-11,939 (5 mg/kg) did not protect against the neurotoxicity of PCA. By comparing the present work with previous studies of MDMA, these results can be interpreted to suggest that the mechanism of the neurotoxicity induced by PCA is not identical to that induced by MDMA. The relationship of these results to the neurotoxicity induced by MDMA is also discussed.",M5

The PCPA dose-dependently decreased brain regional 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) 24 hr later. As per cent decreases of 5-HIAA were greater than those of 5-HT in cortex, striatum and hippocampus 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios fell, suggesting that partial inhibition of 5-HT synthesis by PCPA increases 5-HT conservation in these terminal regions. In the hypothalamus and brain stem, decreases of the ratio were small or absent. The PCA given without subsequent PCPA treatment decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA so that 5-HT fell by about 70% in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus, 55% in the brain stem but only by 27% in the hypothalamus. The PCPA given after PCA decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA further but not the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios and increased the ratio in the brain stem. The 5-HIAA/5-HT findings imply that the increase of 5-HT conservation after PCPA treatment does not occur after partial depletion of 5-HT by PCA. The increase of the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the brain stem is explicable by the resistance to both PCA and PCPA of 5-HT in cell bodies where the ratio is high. Results are discussed in relation to the question of whether the PCA treatment used destroys axon terminals projecting from the dorsal but not from the median raphe.",M5
8801576,"Systemic injection of p-chloroamphetamine eliminates the effect of the 5-HT3 compounds on learning.There is evidence that 5-HT3 antagonists enhance learning and memory; however, their mechanisms of action are unknown. The aim of the present work was to investigate further the role of 5-HT3 receptors involved in learning, using the specific 5-HT3 agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (mCPBG) and the 5-HT3 antagonists ondansetron and tropisetron. p-Chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) pretreatment was used to determine whether pre- or postsynaptic 5-HT3 receptors are involved in learning. The posttraining intraperitoneal (IP) injection of each drug was analyzed on a lever-press response on autoshaping, which is an associative learning task. The results showed that mCPBG impaired retention of the conditioned response (CR), whereas tropisetron and ondansetron improved it. In other animals, PCA alone did not affect CR but was able to block the effects of the 5-HT3 ligands. The present data suggest that the actions of 5-HT3 compounds could be due to their interaction with presynaptic 5-HT3 receptors.",M5
9025109,"The spin trap reagent PBN attenuates degeneration of 5-HT neurones in rat brain induced by p-chloroamphetamine but not fenfluramine.Dark Agouti rats injected with either p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 2.5 mg/kg i.p.) or fenfluramine (15 mg/kg i.p.) had substantial decreases (approximately 50%) in the concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA and binding of [3H]paroxetine in the cerebral cortex 7 days later. This indicates that both compounds had produced neurodegeneration of 5-HT axon terminals. Two doses of alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN; 150 mg/kg i.p.) 130 min apart had no effect on cortical 5-HT content or [3H]paroxetine binding. However, when PBN (150 mg/ kg) was given 10 min before and 120 min after PCA (2.5 mg/kg) it attenuated the PCA-induced neurodegeneration. In contrast, PBN was without significant effect on the fenfluramine-induced damage. Changes in rectal temperature following either the neurotoxins or neurotoxins+ PBN were no more than +/-1 degree C of saline-injected control rats. These data indicate that PCA, like MDMA, probably induces neurotoxic degeneration because of the formation of catechol or quinone metabolites and subsequent reactive tree radical formation. Such a mechanism does not appear to explain fenfluramine-induced damage to 5-HT neurones.",M5
9029405,"Rat strain differences in the vulnerability of serotonergic nerve endings to neurotoxic damage by p-chloroamphetamine.Substituted amphetamines are known to selectively destroy serotonin (5-HT) nerve endings in distant projection fields of the dorsal raphe nuclei and the systemic administration of these drugs is widely used in investigations of the role of the central 5-HT system and of the mechanisms involved in their toxicity. Until now Sprague-Dawley rats were almost exclusively used for this purpose and the findings were thought to apply to other strains as well. We compared the long-term effects of the administration of different doses of para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) on three specific markers of the density of 5-HT presynapses, [3H]-paroxetine binding to 5-HT-transporters, tryptophan hydroxylase apoenzyme contents, and 5-HT levels in the frontal cortex of Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. PCA-treatment caused a dose dependent decline of all three parameters which was much more pronounced in Sprague-Dawley compared to Wistar rats. An i.p. dose of 4 mg PCA/kg body weight, which caused a severe, about 90% reduction of all three parameters of 5-HT innervation in Sprague-Dawley rats was almost ineffective in Wistar rats. The dose of 8 mg/kg which was required to eliminate about 80% of cortical 5-HT presynapses in Wistar rats was already lethal to Sprague-Dawley rats. The reasons of this different susceptibility of the 5-HT system in the two rat strains are unknown. Their elucidation will contribute to a better understanding of inherited differences in individual vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of substituted amphetamines. The combined measurements of transporter density, of tryptophan hydroxylase apoenzyme contents, and of 5-HT levels is a powerful tool for the assessment of experimentally induced changes in the density of 5-HT innervation in distant projection fields of the raphe nuclei.",M5
8602894,"Cerebral metabolic responses to clomipramine are greatly reduced following pretreatment with the specific serotonin neurotoxin para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). A 2-deoxyglucose study in rats.To determine if reported reductions of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) induced by the tryciclic antidepressant clomipramine (CMI) (10 mg/kg) are due to a presynaptic action on serotonin (5-HT) terminals, 3-month-old Fischer-344 rats were given parachloroamphetamine (PCA), a serotonin neurotoxin. rCMRglc was measured 3 weeks later in 55 brain regions after the administration of saline or CMI using the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]2-deoxyglucose procedure. PCA alone increased rCMRglc in the visual cortex. CMI alone reduced rCMRglc in 18 (33%) of the studied regions, including telencephalic, diencephalic, limbic, and brain stem areas. In PCA-lesioned rats, metabolic responses to CMI (10 mg/kg) were greatly reduced, and significant rCMRglc decreases were observed only in 4 (7%) of the brain areas, including the hippocampus and raphe nuclei. Abolition by PCA of the metabolic responses to CMI confirms that CMI, at the dose studied, reduces rCMRglc via a presynaptic mechanism, likely the 5-HT reuptake sites.",M5
8613731,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotes the survival and sprouting of serotonergic axons in rat brain.A pathology of brain serotonergic (5-HT) systems has been found in psychiatric disturbances, normal aging and in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Despite the clinical importance of 5-HT, little is known about the endogenous factors that have neurotrophic influences upon 5-HT neurons. The present study examined whether chronic pain parenchymal administration of the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or NGF could prevent the severe degenerative loss of serotonergic axons normally caused by the selective 5-HT neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). The neurotrophins (5-12 micrograms/d) or the control substances (cytochrome c or PBS vehicle) were continuously infused into the rat frontoparietal cortex using an osmotic minipump. One week later, rats were subcutaneously administered PCA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle, and the 5-HT innervation was evaluated after two more weeks of neurotrophin infusion. As revealed with 5-HT immunocytochemistry, BDNF infusions into the neocortex of intact (non-PCA-lesioned) rats caused a substantial increase in 5-HT axon density in a 3 mm diameter region surrounding the cannula tip. In PCA-lesioned rats, intracortical infusions of BDNF completely prevented the severe neurotoxin-induced loss of 5-HT axons near the infusion cannula. In contrast, cortical infusions of vehicle or the control protein cytochrome c did not alter the density of serotonergic axons in intact animals, nor did control infusions prevent the loss of 5-HT axons in PCA-treated rats. NT-3 caused only a modest sparing of the 5-HT innervation in PCA-treated rats, and NGF failed to prevent the loss of 5-HT axon density. The immunocytochemical data were supported by neurochemical evaluations which showed that BDNF attenuated the PCA-induced loss of 5-HT and 5-HIAA contents and 3H-5-HT uptake near the infusion cannula. Thus, BDNF can promote the sprouting of mature, uninjured serotonergic axons and dramatically enhance the survival or sprouting of 5-HT axons normally damaged by the serotonergic neurotoxin PCA.",M5
7543931,"In vivo electrochemical monitoring of serotonin in spinal dorsal horn with Nafion-coated multi-carbon fiber electrodes.Biosensors sensitive for in vivo monitoring of serotonin (5-HT) in the CNS by differential normal pulse voltammetry were constructed by coating treated multicarbon fiber electrodes (mCFEs) with Nafion (N-mCFE). In vitro sensitivities of mCFE and N-mCFE were compared in solutions ranging from 5 nM to 20 microM of uric acid (UA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 5-HT. The mCFEs were three to seven times less sensitive for 5-HIAA or UA than for 5-HT. Nafion treatment dramatically decreased sensitivity for 5-HIAA and UA of N-mCFEs (approximately 10(3) times), whereas it remained in the nanomolar range for 5-HT. In vivo, in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord of anesthetized rats, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced a reduction (55 +/- 3% at 180 min) of peak 3 of oxidation current (characteristic of 5-hydroxyindoles) monitored with mCFEs, but with N-mCFEs (in this latter case the peak was termed 3N) peak 3N increased to 135 +/- 5% at 180 min. The 5-HT release-inducer p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 6 mg/kg i.p.) induced a slight (12 +/- 3% at 150 min) decrease in peak 3 measured with mCFEs, whereas with N-mCFEs PCA induced a rapid increase of peak 3N (137 +/- 6% at 90 min). The xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced a decrease (30 +/- 3% at 180 min) in peak 3 (mCFEs), but peak 3N (N-mCFEs) was not affected (106% at 180 min).

7762635,"Brain serotonin depletion attenuates diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin.The diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin (STZ) were studied on blood glucose, plasma insulin, feeding and drinking, body weight, islet morphology, and hypothalamic serotonin (5-HT) release in vehicle-pretreated rats and in rats pretreated with either intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; a 5-HT nerve fiber depletor), intraperitoneal injection of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor), or intraperitoneal injection of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; a neurotoxin for 5-HT nerve fiber). At four days after STZ administration, vehicle-treated rats displayed hyperglycemia, polydipsia, polyphagia, decreased plasma insulin level, derangement of islet morphology (few insulin cells, accumulation of glucagon cells), and elevated 5-HT release in the hypothalamus. The above diabetogenic effects of STZ were attenuated by brain serotonin depletion induced by 5,7-DHT, PCPA, or PCA. Furthermore, the STZ-induced hyperglycemia or derangement of islet morphology was attenuated by peripheral sympathectomy or adrenalectomy. It is concluded that brain serotonin depletion attenuates diabetogenic effects of STZ by reducing sympathetic efferent activity in rats.",M5
7583200,"Short-term and long-term effects of p-chloroamphetamine on hippocampal serotonin and corticosteroid receptor levels.Hippocampal corticosteroid receptors are regulated by corticosterone as well as by neurotransmitters, such as serotonin (5-HT). Studies have demonstrated that long-term changes in 5-HT levels are associated with alterations in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) number. However, the effect of short-term manipulations of 5-HT levels on hippocampal corticosteroid receptor levels has not been thoroughly investigated. The present set of studies examined the effect of para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) administration on both short-term and long-term regulation of hippocampal 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor levels. PCA is a selective serotonergic neurotoxin which initially releases 5-HT to cause a short-term depletion of 5-HT stores, followed by a long-term decrease in 5-HT levels which presumably reflects the destruction of 5-HT nerve terminals. In the initial study rats were adrenalectomized and 24 h later injected with PCA (20 mg/kg) and sacrificed 3 h later. PCA produced a large decrease in hippocampal 5-HT (-79%) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (-40%) concentrations. In addition, PCA significantly decreased both hippocampal GR (-28%) and MR (-35%) levels. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), which presumably blocks the uptake of PCA into 5-HT nerve terminals, completely blocked the PCA-induced decreases in both 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor concentrations. In a final experiment, the long-term (7 days) effect of PCA administration on hippocampal 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor levels was examined. PCA (10 mg/kg given on 2 consecutive days) was administered to adrenal-intact rats which were adrenalectomized 6 days later and subsequently sacrificed following a 24 h interval. PCA produced an 87% decrease in hippocampal 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, but did not alter hippocampal GR or MR levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M5
7552242,"5-HT1A agonist and dexamethasone reversal of para-chloroamphetamine induced loss of MAP-2 and synaptophysin immunoreactivity in adult rat brain.Serotonin and dexamethasone act as differentiating agents during development. Reducing circulating adrenal steroids or central 5-HT levels via adrenalectomy (ADX) or the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), respectively, has been shown to have de-differentiating effects in the adult brain. Morphometric analysis of 5-HT, S100 beta, MAP-2 and synaptophysin immunoreactivity (IR) was used to follow the molecular plasticity of several brain regions after lesioning of 5-HT nerve terminals by para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; 2 x 10 mg/kg s.c.), a serotonin neurotoxin. Two weeks after PCA treatment we observed reductions of 5-HT, S100 beta, and MAP-2 IR in parietal and temporal cortex, temporal pole, hippocampus and hypothalamus. The reductions in MAP-2 and synaptophysin-IR were reversed by 3 days of treatment with dexamethasone (10 mg/l drinking water) or ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A agonist (1 mg/kg s.c.). The loss of S100-IR was reversed only by the 5-HT1A agonist. These results indicate that both dexamethasone and serotonin have effects on adult neuronal plasticity but may work via different mechanisms. The implications of these findings to the loss of synaptophysin and MAP-2 staining in Alzheimer's disease are discussed.",M5
7670842,"Effects of scopolamine on spatial working memory in rats pretreated with the serotonergic depleter p-chloroamphetamine.The present study investigated the mnemonic consequences of muscarinic blockade in rats pretreated with the serotonergic depleter p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). Subjects were initially injected with either PCA (2.5 mg/kg) or saline (SAL) approximately 1 week prior to testing on a working memory version of the Morris water maze (four daily trials for 4 days). Fifteen minutes before each daily session, PCA- and SAL-pretreated subjects were injected either with SAL or with one of two doses of scopolamine (SCOP; 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg). Latency to find the platform on each trial served as the major dependent measure. The results indicated that SCOP increased escape latencies. However, the dose needed to produce this effect was dependent upon whether subjects were pretreated with PCA. Significant increases in escape latencies in SAL-pretreated rats were induced with 1.0 mg/kg SCOP (on Day 1), while 0.5 mg/kg SCOP produced the same effect in PCA-pretreated subjects (on Days 1-4). Thus, although it was clearly demonstrated that muscarinic blockade did impair spatial working memory, the present data indicated that the dose necessary to produce this effect was dependent upon the status of the serotonergic system. More generally, these results imply that the cholinergic and serotonergic systems interact in a functionally important, as yet undetermined manner.",M5
7712176,"A serotonin neurotoxin attenuates the phase-shifting effects of triazolam on the circadian clock in hamsters.Several lines of evidence suggest the potential involvement of serotonergic pathways in mediating the effects of activity-inducing stimuli on the circadian clock in rodents. The aim of the present 3 experiments was to examine the effects of the serotonergic neurotoxin, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>, 10 mg/kg) on: (1) the monoamine levels of the hypothalamus, frontal cortex and hippocampus in the hamster; (2) the phase shifts in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity of hamsters in response to treatment with the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam (7.5 mg/kg); and (3) the magnitude of the acute increase in locomotor activity associated with triazolam administration in this species. The administration of PCA to hamsters caused changes of specific monoaminergic systems in the hypothalamus, that were limited to a selective decrease in serotonin levels 7 days post-treatment. The phase shifts of the circadian clock in response to triazolam treatment at CT 6 were considerably attenuated following the administration of the 5-HT neurotoxin. The total amount and the profiles of triazolam-induced wheel-running and general cage activity between CT 6 and CT 12 were not significantly affected by the PCA treatment. The finding that a 5-HT neurotoxin can attenuate the phase-shifting effects of triazolam in hamsters, without interfering with its activity-inducing properties, suggests that serotonergic afferents might be involved in the mechanism for non-photic phase-shifting of the circadian system.",M5
7853205,"Role of hypothermia in the mechanism of protection against serotonergic toxicity. II. Experiments with methamphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine, fenfluramine, dizocilpine and dextromethorphan.Several amphetamine analogs, when administered in high-dose regimens, have been shown to cause long-lasting depletions of central serotonin (5-HT), which are indicative of neuronal toxicity. These depletions and the resulting toxicity can be attenuated pharmacologically or by lowering ambient temperature. The noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (DZ) blocks depletion of 5-HT induced by methamphetamine (METH) and p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), but not fenfluramine (FEN). This study investigated whether the effects of DZ and another calcium channel antagonist, dextromethorphan (DEX), are due to induction of hypothermia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with either saline (SAL), DZ (1 or 2 injections of 2.5 mg/kg), or DEX (75.0 mg/kg) followed by either SAL, METH (4 injections of 10.0 mg/kg), PCA (1 injection of 10.0 mg/kg) or FEN (2 or 4 injections of 12.5 mg/kg). Core body temperature (TEMP) was monitored for 4 h or longer with radiotelemetry. Base-line TEMP was between 37.0 and 37.6 degrees C. SAL/METH caused a significant increase in TEMP which peaked at 40.8 +/- 0.50 degrees C after the last injection. Coadministration of DZ with METH caused TEMP to decrease to 33.8 +/- 0.30 degrees C within 2 h of the first injection and lasting more than 3 h, and protected against depletion of 5-HT. SAL/PCA caused a small increase in TEMP to 37.7 +/- 0.36 degrees C, whereas coadministration of DZ with PCA decreased TEMP to 35.2 +/- 0.50 degrees C, lasting 2 h, in a dose regimen which has been shown to be neuroprotective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M5
7535469,"p-Chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and d-fenfluramine pretreatment attenuates d-fenfluramine-evoked release of 5-HT in vivo.Previous work has suggested that repeated treatment with substituted amphetamines including PCA, MDMA and d-fenfluramine produces a persistent neurodegeneration which is relatively selective for the fine serotoninergic terminals arising from the dorsal raphe nucleus. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the acute releasing effect of d-fenfluramine might also be sensitive to lesions produced by PCA, MDMA and d-fenfluramine itself. Basal and 5-HT release evoked by d-fenfluramine or 100 mM KCl was measured by microdialysis in frontal or parietal cortex of rats 2 weeks after they had been treated with a neurodegenerative regime of PCA, MDMA, d-fenfluramine, or vehicle. In frontal cortex of vehicle controls, d-fenfluramine (10 mg/kg IP) and KCl (100 mM via microdialysis probe) evoked an increase in 5-HT of 1740% and 779% of basal, respectively. PCA pretreatment reduced d-fenfluramine-evoked 5-HT release by 90.9% while potassium-evoked release was reduced by only 66.8%. Similar results were obtained in parietal cortex. MDMA (20 mg/kg x 8) and d-fenfluramine (1.25 mg/kg x 8) pretreatment reduced d-fenfluramine-evoked release of 5-HT in frontal cortex by 45.2% and 72.0%, respectively. Overall, the present data are consistent with the hypothesis that the acute release of 5-HT evoked by d-fenfluramine occurs via those terminals destroyed by pretreatment with PCA, MDMA and d-fenfluramine, while KCl evokes release from both PCA-sensitive and PCA-insensitive terminals. The significance of these results for the interpretation of neuroendocrine data from d-fenfluramine challenge tests is discussed.",M5
7475971,"The serotonergic antidepressant nefazodone inhibits the serotonin transporter: in vivo and ex vivo studies.Nefazodone HCl (Serzone) is a new antidepressant with a chemical structure unrelated to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics, tetracyclics, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Nefazodone is active in a number of preclinical tests for antidepressant activity and shows clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression with a more favorable side-effect profile than the structurally similar antidepressant trazodone. Previous studies have shown that nefazodone is a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors and binds to the serotonin transporter in vitro and in vivo. Nefazodone also binds to the norepinephrine transporter in vitro and in acute ex vivo studies. To further investigate the ability of nefazodone to modify serotonergic transmission, the ability of systemically administered nefazodone to inhibit the serotonin transporter was assessed by investigating the ability of nefazodone to prevent p-chloroamphetamine- (<e>PCA</e>) induced depletions of cortical 5-HT concentrations. In addition, the ability of acute and subchronic nefazodone administration to inhibit ex vivo [3H]-5-HT uptake was assessed. Acute administration of nefazodone (30, 100, and 150 mg/kg) antagonized PCA-induced depletion of cortical 5-HT concentrations in a dose-dependent manner at 1, 2, and 3 hours post-treatment. This effect was directly correlated with serum nefazodone concentrations. Both 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg of nefazodone were equipotent with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) over the course of the experiment with respect to sparing of 5-HT depletion. Acute administration of nefazodone (100 and 150 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased the Km for [3H]-5-HT uptake in rat cortical synaptosomes from 60 nmol/L in controls to 230 and 242 nmol/L in nefazodone-treated rats, respectively. Subchronic administration of nefazodone (100 and 150 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d. x 5.5 days) reduced [3H]-5-HT uptake by 24% and 29%, respectively. Sub-chronic dosing with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d. x 5.5 days) reduced [3H]-5-HT uptake by 65%. These experiments confirm and extend previous reports concerning the ability of nefazodone to inhibit the 5-HT transporter in vivo.",M5
7965077,"Cocaine inhibits GABA release in the VTA through endogenous 5-HT.The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is thought to be involved in the addictive properties of many drugs, including cocaine. It has been hypothesized that cocaine exerts its actions in the VTA by blocking the reuptake of dopamine released from the dendrites of the A10 dopamine neurons, thus prolonging the actions of dopamine at D2 autoreceptors. However, cocaine also blocks the reuptake of the other monoamines, including serotonin (5-HT). Using intracellular recordings from midbrain dopamine neurons in a brain slice preparation, we have found that cocaine (0.1-10 microM) inhibited the GABAB IPSP in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was observed in the presence of the D2 dopamine receptor antagonists sulpiride (1 microM) and eticlopride (0.1 microM). 5-HT mimicked this effect, as did the selective 5-HT1D receptor agonist sumatriptan and the 5-HT-releasing agent fenfluramine. The actions of both 5-HT and cocaine were attenuated by the 5-HT1C/D antagonist metergoline. Pretreatment of slices with the 5-HT-depleting agent p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>; 10 microM) abolished the inhibition of the GABAB IPSP by cocaine but failed to affect the actions of sumatriptan. We conclude that cocaine acts to modulate the GABA input to A10 dopamine neurons via inhibition of the 5-HT transporter, increasing the concentration of 5-HT at presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors. These actions of cocaine were apparent at lower concentrations than those required to act via inhibition of the dopamine transporter. This reduction of inhibitory synaptic input into the VTA would be expected to attenuate the GABA-mediated feedback inhibition from the nucleus accumbens, thus leading to increased activation of dopamine neurons.",M5
7697867,"Transient reduction in hippocampal serotonergic innervation after neonatal parachloroamphetamine treatment.This study examined the effects of parachloroamphetamine on neonatal forebrain serotonergic (5-HT) innervation. Rat pups were treated with <e>PCA</e> on P3 and P4. Significant reductions in 5-HT content were observed in the hippocampal formation, frontal cortex and entorhinal cortex on P5 and P7. By P14, neocortical 5-HT had returned to normal levels while hippocampal 5-HT values remained less than control. Hippocampal 5-HT content reached normal range by P21. High affinity 5-HT uptake in hippocampal synaptosomal preparations was similarly reduced on P5 and P7 suggesting that 5-HT terminals were being lesioned by PCA. 5-HT uptake recovered significantly by P14 perhaps reflecting the extraordinary plasticity of the 5-HT projections in the neonate. However, in contrast to the complete restoration of hippocampal 5-HT content, 5-HT uptake values remained significantly less than control. No change in 5-HT content was observed in either the hypothalamus or midbrain raphe at any age studied. Thus, the rapid onset of effects, regional selectivity and transient reduction of 5-HT levels recommend the use of PCA in studies of the role of 5-HT in hippocampal development.",M5
8070524,"Immunocytochemical evidence for serotonergic neurotoxicity of N-ethyl-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE).N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) is one of a group of substituted amphetamines which have effects on several serotonergic markers such as tissue levels of serotonin and activity of tryptophan hydroxylase. In this study we have compared its effects on the rat brain with those of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) using serotonin immunocytochemistry with a primary 5-HT antibody and a secondary avidin-biotin-HRP antibody. Two weeks after multiple (40 mg/kg x 8), but not single, injections of MDE there was a pronounced reduction in the number of serotonin-immunoreactive axons seen. This reduction was most marked in areas innervated extensively by serotonergic axons with varicosities of the fine type (e.g., posterior cerebral cortex and area CA1 of hippocampus). The reduction was quantitatively less than but qualitatively similar to that produced by a single dose of PCA (10 mg/kg). In material from short (3 day) survival animals, a large number of morphologically highly abnormal forms could be seen, suggestive of degenerating axons. A parallel series of sections prepared using tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry showed no differences between saline controls and PCA- or MDE-treated animals. We conclude that multiple systemic injections of MDE reduce the number of serotonin-immunoreactive fibers in the rat brain 2 weeks after treatment.",M5
7945451,"Tryptophan pretreatment augmentation of p-chloroamphetamine-induced serotonin and dopamine release and reduction of long-term neurotoxicity.The impact of tryptophan (TRP) pretreatment on the neurochemical effects of p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) was investigated. The neurotoxic effects of PCA on serotonin (5-HT) neurons, the acute effects of PCA on extracellular 5-HT and dopamine (DA), and the displacement by PCA of whole blood 5-HT were examined. TRP pretreatment (400 mg/kg of the methyl ester) significantly reduced the long-term (1 week) decrease in tissue 5-HT resulting from PCA (2 mg/kg, i.p., of the hydrochloride salt) in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in the dorsal hippocampus. Microdialysis studies in awake animals showed that this pretreatment regimen resulted in augmented PCA-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT (4-fold) and DA (2-fold). TRP pretreatment also resulted in increased displacement of 5-HT from whole blood. The implications of these results toward possible mechanisms of action of PCA-induced neurotoxicity are discussed.",M5
7953696,"The MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl, but not the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline, potentiates the neurotoxicity of p-chloroamphetamine.The effect of co-administration of MAO inhibitors together with a low dose of the neurotoxic amphetamine p-chloroamphetamine (<e>pCA</e>) on neurotoxicity was examined. Neurotoxicity was assessed by measuring decreases in the binding of [3H]cyanoimipramine to serotonin uptake sites using quantitative autoradiography. By itself, a low dose of pCA (2 mg/kg) did not produce any alterations in radioligand binding, measured 7 days after drug administration. However, co-administration of the MAO-B selective inhibitor deprenyl (1 mg/kg) or the non-selective inhibitor pargyline (50 mg/kg) produced significant decreases in radioligand binding. Measurements of the effects of these drugs on body temperature ruled out the possibility that deprenyl and pargyline were increasing neurotoxicity by producing a drug-induced hyperthermia. In contrast to the effects of deprenyl and pargyline, co-administration of the MAO-A selective inhibitor clorgyline (1 mg/kg) did not alter binding. By themselves none of the MAO inhibitors produced neurotoxic effects. There are a number of possible explanations for these results. Administration of deprenyl or pargyline, together with pCA, itself a MAO-A inhibitor, will lead to inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B activities. This will likely lead to an enhanced release of dopamine and serotonin compared with the release following administration of pCA alone or pCA together with clorgyline. Elevation of the extracellular levels of either or both of these monoamines could lead to enhanced neurotoxicity. Whatever the mechanism involved, our results show that the co-administration of a type-B MAOI enhances the neurotoxic effects of pCA on serotonin neurons.",M5
8029248,"Opposite effects of <e>PCA</e> and chlorimipramine on ICSS and on its facilitation by amphetamine.The long-term effects of chloramphetamine (PCA) and chlorimipramine (CHLOR) on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) were investigated in sessions lasting 13 h. PCA, 5 mg/kg given IP, led first to an attenuation of ICSS lasting 3 h, then to a slow recovery to baseline rates, and then to a facilitation of ICSS lasting 6 h. Repeating the treatment 7 days later resulted in less attenuation of ICSS, more rapid recovery, and longer-lasting facilitation. Again, repeating the treatment with PCA 7 days later but injecting simultaneously amphetamine (AMPH) 2 mg/kg IP, altered the response seen with PCA alone. The attenuation phase was missing but the facilitatory phase remained except that it occurred early and was of shorter duration than after PCA given alone. Pretreatment with haloperidol (HALO) 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg IP before PCA blocked the facilitatory phase of the response. CHLOR injected at a dose of 15 mg/kg IP attenuated ICSS. The combined administration of CHLOR and AMPH led to the CHLOR-attenuation of ICSS being replaced by a modest facilitation. These results are discussed in terms of the biochemical actions of PCA and CHLOR on the serotonin and dopamine systems.",M5
8027444,"Light and electron microscopic studies of the effects of p-chloroamphetamine on the monoaminergic innervation of the rat spinal cord.A previous report has shown that small diameter serotoninergic (5-HT) axons innervating the forebrain are selectively eliminated by treatment with an amphetamine derivative, (+/-)p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>; Mamounas et al., [1991] J. Comp. Neurol. 314:558-586). It is well known that the spinal cord is the target of numerous monoaminergic fibers of different types. We have previously shown that the dorsal and ventral horns and the intermediolateral cell column are innervated by numerous serotonin-, noradrenaline- and dopamine-containing axons, including both thin axons with small varicosities and beaded axons with large varicosities. In all these regions, the large majority of fine indolaminergic fibers do not establish synaptic contacts, contrasting with the beaded axons which mostly exhibit synapses. The present work was conducted to study the effect of PCA on the monoaminergic innervation of the adult rat spinal cord. Animals received two subcutaneous doses of PCA 24 hours apart and were perfused 3 weeks later. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect 5-HT, noradrenergic and dopaminergic fibers by using light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy revealed that PCA treatment caused a marked and selective elimination of the fine 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers, mainly found in the dorsal horn, but spared all other larger axons. This selective effect on the dorsal horn innervating thin 5-HT fibers was confirmed with the electron microscope by calculating the synaptic incidence(s) of monoaminergic innervation. These results suggest that fine and beaded 5-HT axons correspond to two anatomically, biochemically and pharmacologically different types of fibers, which could arise from two subpopulations of brainstem neurons. In addition, this drug could be used to provide an experimental animal, devoid of 5-HT nonsynaptic fibers, thereby facilitating a study on the role of dorsal horn nonsynaptic system in pain modulation.",M5
7834349,"Effect of p-chloroamphetamine administration on monoamine metabolism in the rat nucleus accumbens and locomotor activity: studies with intracerebral dialysis in freely moving rats.Changes in the level of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites [3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA)] and serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite [5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)] were determined sequentially in freely moving rats by using a brain dialysis method. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between changes in the monoamine metabolism in the nucleus accumbens and locomotor activities following <e>PCA</e> administration. Subsequently it was found that locomotor activity significantly increased 1 and 2 h after PCA administration (2 mg/kg, i.p.) while the DA content in the dialysis fluid rose significantly after 1 and 2 h. On the other hand, the 5-HT level did not show significant changes. The DOPAC, HVA, and 5-HIAA levels were significantly reduced 1 to 6 h after PCA administration. It was suggested that the increase in locomotor activity caused by PCA administration is an expression of abnormal behavior caused by DA release from the nucleus accumbens.",M5
8042142,"Quantitative autoradiography of the serotonin transporter to assess the distribution of serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nucleus.The binding of 3H-CN-IMI to 5-HT uptake sites, as measured by quantitative autoradiography, was used as a marker of serotonergic neurons. Within the dorsal raphe nucleus the binding of 3H-CN-IMI was compared in adjacent coronal sections of rat brain to the binding of 3H-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors, which have a known somatodendritic localization. The heterogeneous pattern of binding of these two radioligands within the dorsal raphe nucleus was similar and corresponded to the distribution of serotonergic cell bodies as visualized by 5-HT immunohistochemistry. Intracerebroventricular administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), which caused a dramatic loss of 5-HT immunoreactivity and 3H-DPAT binding to 5-HT1A receptors, resulted in a marked reduction of 3H-CN-IMI binding in this nucleus. Treatment of rats with a dose of para-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) which has been reported to selectively lesion serotonergic processes arising from the dorsal raphe nucleus, while sparing serotonergic cell bodies and projections from the median raphe nucleus, did not alter the binding of 3H-DPAT or 3H-CN-IMI in the dorsal raphe nucleus; serotonergic cell bodies appeared morphologically unaffected. The lack of effect of PCA treatment on the binding of 3H-DPAT and 3H-CN-IMI is consistent with a somatodendritic localization of the 5-HT transporter in the dorsal raphe nucleus. PCA treatment appeared to produce a moderate loss of serotonergic innervation in serotonergic terminal field areas as visualized by serotonin immunohistochemistry. The reductions in 3H-CN-IMI binding observed in terminal field areas (24 to 69%) following treatment of rats with PCA did not reflect a marked differential innervation of forebrain areas by the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei as expected from previous biochemical studies, and were not entirely consistent with the findings of neuroanatomical studies using histochemical techniques. Site-specific injection of 5,7-DHT into the dorsal raphe nucleus produced an 80 +/- 11% reduction in the binding of 3H-CN-IMI in this nucleus, whereas the binding of 3H-CN-IMI in the median raphe nucleus was not reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M5
7913223,"The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the anticonflict activity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.Using the conflict drinking test as a model, we studied in rats the effect of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers pindolol and cyanopindolol which bind to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, and of the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI 118,551, respectively, which have a negligible affinity for 5-HT receptors. Both pindolol (2.0-8.0 mg/kg) and cyanopindolol (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) showed an anticonflict effect, having dose dependently increased the number of punished licks. On the other hand, neither betaxolol nor ICI 118,551--administered separately or in combination--affected the punished responding. The anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol were completely abolished by the 5-HT1A receptor and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phtalimmido)butyl]piperazine (NAN-190), but were not modified by the selective alpha 1(-)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. The effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol were also not modified in animals with lesions of 5-HT neurons, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>). Moreover, it was also found that the anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol in PCA-pretreated rats were antagonized by NAN-190 but not prazosin. Our results indicate that the anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol depend on their agonist action on postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.",M5
8044692,"Cocaine-induced deficits in ACTH and corticosterone responses in female rat progeny.The objective of this study was to determine whether prenatal exposure to cocaine could produce functional changes in central serotonergic systems mediating neuroendocrine responses in female progeny. Pregnant rats were administered either saline or (-) cocaine (15 mg/kg, SC, b.i.d.) from gestational day 13-20. Progeny were fostered to nontreated lactating dams at birth. Central serotonergic function was determined by the ability of a serotonin releaser, p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>), to stimulate plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), corticosterone, and renin secretion in female progeny at postnatal day (PD) 30. Prenatal cocaine did not alter basal levels of ACTH, corticosterone, or renin. In contrast, ACTH and corticosterone responses to the 5-HT releaser PCA were significantly attenuated (-28% to 43%) in cocaine progeny, while the renin response to PCA was unaffected. These data suggest that cocaine administration during pregnancy can produce long-term selective alterations in neuroendocrine responses mediated by central serotonergic systems in prepubescent female progeny.",M5
8070892,"Microglial response to degeneration of serotonergic axon terminals.The neurotoxic drug p-chloramphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) causes widespread degeneration of fine, unmyelinated serotonergic (5-HT) axons in the forebrain. PCA toxicity is selective for 5-HT axon terminals; preterminal axons and cell bodies are spared. Degeneration is followed by slowly progressive axonal sprouting and partial reinnervation. PCA is injected subcutaneously; this route of administration avoids mechanical disruption of the blood brain barrier. The present study analyzed the response of microglia and astrocytes in rat brain to selective ablation of 5-HT axons by PCA. Several microglial markers were analyzed with immunocytochemical methods. An increase in the number of microglial processes and in immunoreactive staining was observed with antibodies directed against CR-3, MHC-I, CD4, and rat LCA. The microglial response was maximal 3 weeks after PCA treatment, became less evident 6 weeks after treatment, and by 9 weeks no difference was observed between treated and control rats. No change was detected in MHC-II or the macrophage marker ED1, nor in expression of GFAP by astrocytes. Thus, degeneration of 5-HT axon terminals affects only a subset of the microglial markers examined; in comparison, retrograde reaction to facial nerve transection causes a robust increase in all of these markers and in GFAP. The microglial response to PCA-induced axon loss is slow in onset and small in magnitude. These findings indicate that CNS microglia are activated by degeneration of fine, unmyelinated 5-HT axon terminals; furthermore, sensitive microglial markers can detect a subtle axonal lesion that provokes no detectable increase in GFAP expression by astrocytes.",M5
7903417,"Amphetamine derivatives interact with both plasma membrane and secretory vesicle biogenic amine transporters.The interaction of fenfluramine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and p-chloroamphetamine (<e>PCA</e>) with the platelet plasma membrane serotonin transporter and the vesicular amine transporter were studied using both transport and binding measurements. Fenfluramine is apparently a substrate for the plasma membrane transporter, and consequently inhibits both serotonin transport and imipramine binding. Moreover, fenfluramine exchanges with internal [3H]serotonin in a plasma membrane transporter-mediated reaction that requires NaCl and is blocked by imipramine. These properties are similar to those of MDMA and PCA as previously described. In adrenal chromaffin granule membrane vesicles containing the vesicular amine transporter, fenfluramine inhibited serotonin transport and dissipated the transmembrane pH difference (delta pH) that drives amine uptake. The use of [3H]reserpine-binding measurements to determine drug interaction with the vesicular amine transporter allowed assessment of the relative ability of MDMA, PCA, and fenfluramine to bind to the substrate site of the vesicular transporter. These measurements permit a distinction between inhibition of vesicular serotonin transport by directly blocking vesicular amine transport and by dissipating delta pH. The results indicate that MDMA and fenfluramine inhibit by both mechanisms but PCA dissipates delta pH without blocking vesicular amine transport directly.",M5
