20028084,"Kinetic mechanism of DNA unwinding by the <e>BLM</e> helicase core and molecular basis for its low processivity.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a strong predisposition to a wide range of cancers commonly affecting the general population. Understanding the functioning mechanism of the BLM protein may provide the opportunity to develop new effective therapy strategies. In this work, we studied the DNA unwinding kinetic mechanism of the helicase core of the BLM protein using various stopped-flow assays. We show that the helicase core of BLM unwinds duplex DNA as monomers even under conditions strongly favoring oligomerization. An unwinding rate of approximately 20 steps per second and a step size of 1 bp have been determined. We have observed that the helicase has a very low processivity. From dissociation and inhibition experiments, we have found that during its ATP hydrolysis cycle in DNA unwinding the helicase tends to dissociate from the DNA substrate in the ADP state. The experimental results imply that the BLM helicase core may unwind duplex DNA in an inchworm manner.",M1
19966276,"Altered gene expression in the Werner and Bloom syndromes is associated with sequences having G-quadruplex forming potential.The human Werner and Bloom syndromes (WS and BS) are caused by deficiencies in the WRN and <e>BLM</e> RecQ helicases, respectively. WRN, BLM and their Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Sgs1, are particularly active in vitro in unwinding G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA), a family of non-canonical nucleic acid structures formed by certain G-rich sequences. Recently, mRNA levels from loci containing potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) were found to be preferentially altered in sgs1Delta mutants, suggesting that G4-DNA targeting by Sgs1 directly affects gene expression. Here, we extend these findings to human cells. Using microarrays to measure mRNAs obtained from human fibroblasts deficient for various RecQ family helicases, we observe significant associations between loci that are upregulated in WS or BS cells and loci that have PQS. No such PQS associations were observed for control expression datasets, however. Furthermore, upregulated genes in WS and BS showed no or dramatically reduced associations with sequences similar to PQS but that have considerably reduced potential to form intramolecular G4-DNA. These findings indicate that, like Sgs1, WRN and BLM can regulate transcription globally by targeting G4-DNA.",M1
19935873,"Does <e>BLM</e> helicase unwind nucleosomal DNA?RecQ helicases maintain chromosome stability by resolving several highly specific DNA structures. BLM, the protein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, is a member of the RecQ helicase family, and possesses both DNA-unwinding and strand-annealing activity. In this study, we have investigated the unwinding activity of BLM on nucleosomal DNA, the natural nuclear substrate for the enzyme. We generated a DNA template including a strong nucleosome-positioning sequence flanked by forked DNA, which is reportedly one of the preferred DNA substrates for BLM. BLM did not possess detectable unwinding activity toward the forked DNA substrate. However, the truncated BLM, lacking annealing activity, unwound it partially. In the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the unwinding activity of both the full-length and the truncated BLMs was promoted. Next, the histone octamer was reconstituted onto the forked DNA to generate a forked mononucleosome. Full-length BLM did not unwind the nucleosomal DNA, but truncated BLM unwound it partially. The unwinding activity for the mononucleosome was not promoted dramatically with RPA. These results indicate that full-length BLM may require additional factors to unwind nucleosomal DNA in vivo, and that RPA is, on its own, unable to perform this auxiliary function.",M1
19709744,"Irradiated <e>Blm</e>-deficient mice are a highly tumor prone model for analysis of a broad spectrum of hematologic malignancies.Mutations in the BLM gene cause human Bloom syndrome (BS), an autosomal recessive disorder of growth retardation, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition. Homozygous null Blm(m3/m3) mice are cancer prone with a 5-fold increased risk of cancer compared with Blm(m3/+) and Blm(+/+) mice. Irradiation of Blm(m3/m3) mice increased the risk to 28-fold. Tumors occurred mainly in the hematopoietic system and were similar to those in BS based on detailed histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Irradiated Blm-deficient mice thus provide a novel model for understanding accelerated malignancies in BS and a new platform for investigating the molecular basis for a wide range of hematopoietic neoplasms.",M1
19465922,"Replication stress induces sister-chromatid bridging at fragile site loci in mitosis.Several inherited syndromes in humans are associated with cancer predisposition. The gene products defective in two of these disorders, <e>BLM</e> (a helicase defective in Bloom's syndrome) and FANC A-N (defective in Fanconi anaemia), associate in a multienzyme complex called BRAFT. How these proteins suppress tumorigenesis remains unclear, although both conditions are associated with chromosome instability. Here we show that the Fanconi anaemia proteins FANCD2 and FANCI specifically associate with common fragile site loci irrespective of whether the chromosome is broken. Unexpectedly, these loci are frequently interlinked through BLM-associated ultra-fine DNA bridges (UFBs) even as cells traverse mitosis. Similarly to fragile site expression, fragile site bridging is induced after partial inhibition of DNA replication. We propose that, after replication stress, sister chromatids are interlinked by replication intermediates primarily at genetic loci with intrinsic replication difficulties, such as fragile sites. In Bloom's syndrome cells, inefficient resolution of DNA linkages at fragile sites gives rise to increased numbers of anaphase UFBs and micronuclei containing fragile site DNA. Our data have general implications concerning the contribution of fragile site loci to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis.",M1
19465921,"The FANC pathway and <e>BLM</e> collaborate during mitosis to prevent micro-nucleation and chromosome abnormalities.Loss-of-function of caretaker genes characterizes a group of cancer predisposition diseases that feature cellular hypersensitivity to DNA damage and chromosome fragility; this group includes Fanconi anaemia and Bloom syndrome. The products of the 13 FANC genes (mutated in Fanconi anaemia), which constitute the 'FANC' pathway, and BLM (the RecQ helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome) are thought to collaborate during the S phase of the cell cycle, preventing chromosome instability. Recently, BLM has been implicated in the completion of sister chromatid separation during mitosis, a complex process in which precise regulation and execution is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Here we show for the first time a role for the FANC pathway in chromosome segregation during mitotic cell division. FANCD2, a key component of the pathway, localizes to discrete spots on mitotic chromosomes. FANCD2 chromosomal localization is responsive to replicative stress and specifically targets aphidicolin (APH)-induced chromatid gaps and breaks. Our data indicate that the FANC pathway is involved in rescuing abnormal anaphase and telophase (ana-telophase) cells, limiting aneuploidy and reducing chromosome instability in daughter cells. We further address a cooperative role for the FANC pathway and BLM in preventing micronucleation, through FANC-dependent targeting of BLM to non-centromeric abnormal structures induced by replicative stress. We reveal new crosstalk between FANC and BLM proteins, extending their interaction beyond the S-phase rescue of damaged DNA to the safeguarding of chromosome stability during mitosis.",M1
19442250,"Genomic instability and cancer: lessons from analysis of Bloom's syndrome.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and cancer predisposition. The underlying genetic defect is mutation of the <e>BLM</e> gene, producing deficiency in the RecQ helicase BLM (Bloom's syndrome protein). The present article begins by introducing BLM and its binding partners before reviewing its known biochemical activities and its potential roles both as a pro-recombinase and as a suppressor of homologous recombination. Finally, the evidence for an emerging role in mitotic chromosome segregation is examined.",M1
19238688,"Bloom's syndrome workshop focuses on the functional specificities of RecQ helicases.Human cells express five DNA helicases that are paralogs of Escherichia coli RecQ and which constitute the family of human RecQ helicases. Disease-causing mutations in three of these five human DNA helicases, <e>BLM</e>, WRN, and RECQL4, cause rare severe human genetic diseases with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by developmental defects, skin abnormalities, genomic instability, and cancer susceptibility. Although biochemical and genetic evidence support roles for all five human RecQ helicases in DNA replication, DNA recombination, and the biological responses to DNA damage, many questions concerning the various functions of the human RecQ helicases remain unanswered. Researchers investigating human and non-human RecQ helicases held a workshop on May 27-28, 2008, at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center, during which they shared insights, discussed recent progress in understanding the biochemistry, biology, and genetics of the RecQ helicases, and developed research strategies that might lead to therapeutic approaches to the human diseases that result from mutations in RecQ helicase genes. Some workshop sessions were held jointly with members of a recently formed advocacy and support group for persons with Bloom's syndrome and their families. This report describes the outcomes and main discussion points of the workshop.",M1
19168994,"A novel role for Rad17 in homologous recombination.Replication checkpoint protein Rad17 senses DNA lesions during DNA replication and halts progression of replication fork. The cells derived from Bloom syndrome individuals show some defects in DNA replication. In order to investigate the functional relationship between the replication checkpoint protein Rad17 and <e>BLM</e>, which is the product of the causative gene of Bloom syndrome, we generated BLM/RAD17 double knockout (blm/rad17) cells using chicken DT40 cells. The blm/rad17 cells showed exaggerated growth defects as determined by analysis of their growth curves and plating efficiency compared to those of either of the single gene mutants. These defects seem to be due to an increase in DNA lesions that cause spontaneous cell death, suggesting that Rad17 and BLM execute different functions in the progression of replication forks. We also demonstrate that targeting integration was dramatically compromised by a lack of Rad17. In addition, the elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) due to homologous recombination in BLM knockout (blm) cells was greatly reduced by disruption of the RAD17 gene. Thus, in addition to its role in the replication checkpoint, Rad17 appears to play a role in homologous recombination.",M1
19165145,"<e>BLM</e> helicase measures DNA unwound before switching strands and hRPA promotes unwinding reinitiation.Bloom syndrome (BS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by genomic instability and a high predisposition to cancer. The gene defective in BS, BLM, encodes a member of the RecQ family of 3'-5' DNA helicases, and is proposed to function in recombinational repair during DNA replication. Here, we have utilized single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy to examine the behaviour of BLM on forked DNA substrates. Strikingly, BLM unwound individual DNA molecules in a repetitive manner, unwinding a short length of duplex DNA followed by rapid reannealing and reinitiation of unwinding in several successions. Our results show that a monomeric BLM can 'measure' how many base pairs it has unwound, and once it has unwound a critical length, it reverses the unwinding reaction through strand switching and translocating on the opposing strand. Repetitive unwinding persisted even in the presence of hRPA, and interaction between wild-type BLM and hRPA was necessary for unwinding reinitiation on hRPA-coated DNA. The reported activities may facilitate BLM processing of stalled replication forks and illegitimately formed recombination intermediates.",M1
19109166,"Genomic instability resulting from <e>Blm</e> deficiency compromises development, maintenance, and function of the B cell lineage.The RecQ family helicase BLM is critically involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, and BLM mutation causes the heritable disorder Bloom's syndrome. Affected individuals suffer from a predisposition to a multitude of cancer types and an ill-defined immunodeficiency involving low serum Ab titers. To investigate its role in B cell biology, we inactivated murine Blm specifically in B lymphocytes in vivo. Numbers of developing B lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and mature B cells in the periphery were drastically reduced upon Blm inactivation. Of the major peripheral B cell subsets, B1a cells were most prominently affected. In the sera of Blm-deficient naive mice, concentrations of all Ig isotypes were low, particularly IgG3. Specific IgG Ab responses upon immunization were poor and mutant B cells exhibited a generally reduced Ab class switch capacity in vitro. We did not find evidence for a crucial role of Blm in the mechanism of class switch recombination. However, a modest shift toward microhomology-mediated switch junction formation was observed in Blm-deficient B cells. Finally, a cohort of p53-deficient, conditional Blm knockout mice revealed an increased propensity for B cell lymphoma development. Impaired cell cycle progression and survival as well as high rates of chromosomal structural abnormalities in mutant B cell blasts were identified as the basis for the observed effects. Collectively, our data highlight the importance of BLM-dependent genome surveillance for B cell immunity by ensuring proper development and function of the various B cell subsets while counteracting lymphomagenesis.",M1
18929858,"Isolation and sequencing of pig <e>Blm</e> and Ubl-1/SUMO-1 genes that relate to the recombination machinery.BACKGROUND: The gene knockout technique is important in xenotransplantation research. Herein we have described the molecular cloning of two genes that are candidates to overcome the poor rate of homologous recombination. METHODS: Candidate cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the corresponding primer sets deduced from a multiple alignment analysis of other mammalian genes from a cDNA library prepared from pig spleen tissue. To obtain the full-length cDNA, a 5'- and 3'-RACE PCR experiments was performed. RESULTS: We successfully isolated the cDNA sequences of two pig genes--BLM, a Bloom's syndrome-related gene, and UBL-1/SUMO-1--which are closely related to homologous recombination events. As a result, we verified the sequences of pig BLM and pig UBL-1/SUMO-1. The nucleic acid and amino acid coding sequence homologies of pig BLM gene with the corresponding human gene were 87.3% and 82.9%, respectively. The nucleic acid and amino acid coding sequence homologies of the pig UBL-1/SUMO-1 gene with the human gene were 96.4% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Current research into homologous recombination provides the possibility for improvement of gene knockout efficiency by regulating the gene expression profiles of recombination-related genes. Transient interference with the expression of pig UBL-1/SUMO-1 and BLM is expected to improve gene targeting. The results of the present study provided important information to design siRNA knockdown vectors. They were also useful for ex ante evaluation of expression profiles of these genes in primary cultures of somatic cells, which may enhance the production of gene knockout pigs.",M1
18923083,"BLAP18/RMI2, a novel OB-fold-containing protein, is an essential component of the Bloom helicase-double Holliday junction dissolvasome.Bloom Syndrome is an autosomal recessive cancer-prone disorder caused by mutations in the <e>BLM</e> gene. BLM encodes a DNA helicase of the RECQ family, and associates with Topo IIIalpha and BLAP75/RMI1 (BLAP for BLM-associated polypeptide/RecQ-mediated genome instability) to form the BTB (BLM-Topo IIIalpha-BLAP75/RMI1) complex. This complex can resolve the double Holliday junction (dHJ), a DNA intermediate generated during homologous recombination, to yield noncrossover recombinants exclusively. This attribute of the BTB complex likely serves to prevent chromosomal aberrations and rearrangements. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel member of the BTB complex termed BLAP18/RMI2. BLAP18/RMI2 contains a putative OB-fold domain, and several lines of evidence suggest that it is essential for BTB complex function. First, the majority of BLAP18/RMI2 exists in complex with Topo IIIalpha and BLAP75/RMI1. Second, depletion of BLAP18/RMI2 results in the destabilization of the BTB complex. Third, BLAP18/RMI2-depleted cells show spontaneous chromosomal breaks and are sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate treatment. Fourth, BLAP18/RMI2 is required to target BLM to chromatin and for the assembly of BLM foci upon hydroxyurea treatment. Finally, BLAP18/RMI2 stimulates the dHJ resolution capability of the BTB complex. Together, these results establish BLAP18/RMI2 as an essential member of the BTB dHJ dissolvasome that is required for the maintenance of a stable genome.",M1
18923082,"RMI, a new OB-fold complex essential for Bloom syndrome protein to maintain genome stability.<e>BLM</e>, the helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome, associates with topoisomerase 3alpha, RMI1 (RecQ-mediated genome instability), and RPA, to form a complex essential for the maintenance of genome stability. Here we report a novel component of the BLM complex, RMI2, which interacts with RMI1 through two oligonucleotide-binding (OB)-fold domains similar to those in RPA. The resulting complex, named RMI, differs from RPA in that it lacks obvious DNA-binding activity. Nevertheless, RMI stimulates the dissolution of a homologous recombination intermediate in vitro and is essential for the stability, localization, and function of the BLM complex in vivo. Notably, inactivation of RMI2 in chicken DT40 cells results in an increased level of sister chromatid exchange (SCE)--the hallmark feature of Bloom syndrome cells. Epistasis analysis revealed that RMI2 and BLM suppress SCE within the same pathway. A point mutation in the OB domain of RMI2 disrupts the association between BLM and the rest of the complex, and abrogates the ability of RMI2 to suppress elevated SCE. Our data suggest that multi-OB-fold complexes mediate two modes of BLM action: via RPA-mediated protein-DNA interaction, and via RMI-mediated protein-protein interactions.",M1
18923075,"DNA helicases Sgs1 and <e>BLM</e> promote DNA double-strand break resection.A key cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is 5'-to-3' DSB resection by nucleases to generate regions of ssDNA that then trigger cell cycle checkpoint signaling and DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we reveal that in the absence of exonuclease Exo1 activity, deletion or mutation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RecQ-family helicase, Sgs1, causes pronounced hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. Moreover, we establish that this reflects severely compromised DSB resection, deficient DNA damage signaling, and strongly impaired HR-mediated repair. Furthermore, we show that the mammalian Sgs1 ortholog, BLM--whose deficiency causes cancer predisposition and infertility in people--also functions in parallel with Exo1 to promote DSB resection, DSB signaling and resistance to DSB-generating agents. Collectively, these data establish evolutionarily conserved roles for the BLM and Sgs1 helicases in DSB processing, signaling, and repair.",M1
18923071,"More complexity to the Bloom's syndrome complex.Bloom's syndrome is caused by mutations in the <e>BLM</e> gene. The BLM gene product, BLM helicase, forms a complex with two other proteins, DNA topoisomerase IIIalpha and RMI1. In this issue of Genes &amp; Development, Wang and colleagues (2843-2855) and Meetei and colleagues (2856-2868) report the discovery of a fourth component of this complex called RMI2.

18471088,"Three new <e>BLM</e> gene mutations associated with Bloom syndrome.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease predisposing patients to all types of cancers affecting the general population. BS cells display a high level of genetic instability, including a 10-fold increase in the rate of sister chromatid exchanges, currently the only objective criterion for BS diagnosis. We have developed a method for screening the BLM gene for mutations based on direct genomic DNA sequencing. A questionnaire based on clinical information, cytogenetic features, and family history was addressed to physicians prescribing BS genetic screening, with the aim of confirming or guiding diagnosis. We report here four BLM gene mutations, three of which have not been described before. Three of the mutations are frameshift mutations, and the fourth is a nonsense mutation. All these mutations introduce a stop codon, and may therefore be considered to have deleterious biological effect. This approach should make it possible to identify new mutations and to correlate them with clinical information.",M1
18401830,"Protein kinase A subunit expression is altered in Bloom syndrome fibroblasts and the <e>BLM</e> protein is increased in adrenocortical hyperplasias: inverse findings for BLM and PRKAR1A.Bloom syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with chromosomal instability and a predisposition to tumors that is caused by germline mutations of the BLM gene, a RecQ helicase. Benign adrenocortical tumors display a degree of chromosomal instability that is more significant than benign tumors of other tissues. Cortisol-producing hyperplasias, such as primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which has been associated with protein kinase A (PKA) abnormalities and/or PRKAR1A mutations, also show genomic instability. Another RecQ helicase, WRN, directly interacts with the PRKAR1B subunit of PKA. In this study, we have investigated the PRKAR1A expression in primary human Bloom syndrome cell lines with known BLM mutations and examined the BLM gene expression in PPNAD and other adrenal tumor tissues. PRKAR1A and other protein kinase A (PKA) subunits were expressed in Bloom syndrome cells and their level of expression differed by subunit and cell type. Overall, fibroblasts exhibited a significant decrease in protein expression of all PKA subunits except for PRKAR1A, a pattern that has been associated with neoplastic transformation in several cell types. The BLM protein was upregulated in PPNAD and other hyperplasias, compared to samples from normal adrenals and normal cortex, as well as samples from cortisol- and aldosterone-producing adenomas (in which BLM was largely absent). These data reveal an inverse relationship between BLM and PRKAR1A: BLM deficiency is associated with a relative excess of PRKAR1A in fibroblasts compared to other PKA subunits; and PRKAR1A deficiency is associated with increased BLM protein in adrenal hyperplasias.",M1
18379138,"Vertebrate WRNIP1 and <e>BLM</e> are required for efficient maintenance of genome stability.Bloom syndrome (BS) is rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with chromosomal instability. The gene responsible for BS, BLM, encodes a protein belonging to the RecQ helicase family. Disruptions of the SGS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes the RecQ helicase homologue in the budding yeast, causes accelerated aging, and this phenotype is enhanced by the disruption of MGS1, the budding yeast homologue for WRNIP1. To examine the functional relationship between RecQ and WRNIP1 in vertebrate cells, we generated and characterized wrnip1/blm cells derived from the chicken B-lymphocyte line DT40. wrnip1/blm cells showed an additive elevation of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), suggesting that both genes independently contribute to the suppression of excess SCE formation. The double mutants were more sensitive to DNA damage from camptothecin (CPT), but not to damage from methyl methanesulfonate, than either single mutant. This result suggests that WRNIP1 and BLM function independently to repair DNA or induce tolerance to the lesions induced by CPT.",M1
18210922,"Prevalence of breast and colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish carriers of Fanconi anemia and Bloom syndrome.BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia complementation group C and Bloom syndrome, rare autosomal recessive disorders marked by chromosome instability, are especially prevalent in the Ashkenazi* Jewish community. A single predominant mutation for each has been reported in Ahshkenazi Jews: c.711+4A--&gt;T (IVS4 +4 A--&gt;T) in FACC and <e>BLM</e>(Ash) in Bloom syndrome. Individuals affected by either of these syndromes are characterized by susceptibility for developing malignancies, and we questioned whether heterozygote carriers have a similarly increased risk. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cancer rate among FACC and BLM(Ash) carriers and their families over three previous generations in unselected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. METHODS: We studied 42 FACC carriers, 28 BLM(Ash) carriers and 43 controls. The control subjects were Ashkenazi Jews participating in our prenatal genetic screening program who tested negative for FACC and BLM(Ash). All subjects filled out a questionnaire regarding their own and a three-generation family history of cancer. The prevalence rates of cancer among relatives of FACC, BLM(Ash) and controls were computed and compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS: In 463 relatives of FACC carriers, 45 malignancies were reported (9.7%) including 10 breast (2.2%) and 13 colon cancers (2.8%). Among 326 relatives of BLM(Ash) carriers there were 30 malignancies (9.2%) including 7 breast (2.1%) and 4 colon cancers (1.2%). Controls consisted of 503 family members with 63 reported malignancies (12.5%) including 11 breast (2.2%) and 11 colon cancers (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We found no significantly increased prevalence of malignancies among carriers in at least three generations compared to the controls.",M1
18195102,"Longevity mutation in SCH9 prevents recombination errors and premature genomic instability in a Werner/Bloom model system.Werner and Bloom syndromes are human diseases characterized by premature age-related defects including elevated cancer incidence. Using a novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system for aging and cancer, we show that cells lacking the RecQ helicase SGS1 (WRN and <e>BLM</e> homologue) undergo premature age-related changes, including reduced life span under stress and calorie restriction (CR), G1 arrest defects, dedifferentiation, elevated recombination errors, and age-dependent increase in DNA mutations. Lack of SGS1 results in a 110-fold increase in gross chromosomal rearrangement frequency during aging of nondividing cells compared with that generated during the initial population expansion. This underscores the central role of aging in genomic instability. The deletion of SCH9 (homologous to AKT and S6K), but not CR, protects against the age-dependent defects in sgs1Delta by inhibiting error-prone recombination and preventing DNA damage and dedifferentiation. The conserved function of Akt/S6k homologues in lifespan regulation raises the possibility that modulation of the IGF-I-Akt-56K pathway can protect against premature aging syndromes in mammals.",M1
18054789,"Bloom's syndrome helicase and Mus81 are required to induce transient double-strand DNA breaks in response to DNA replication stress.Perturbed DNA replication either activates a cell cycle checkpoint, which halts DNA replication, or decreases the rate of DNA synthesis without activating a checkpoint. Here we report that at low doses, replication inhibitors did not activate a cell cycle checkpoint, but they did activate a process that required functional Bloom's syndrome-associated (<e>BLM</e>) helicase, Mus81 nuclease and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase to induce transient double-stranded DNA breaks. The induction of transient DNA breaks was accompanied by dissociation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA polymerase alpha from replication forks. In cells with functional BLM, Mus81 and ATR, the transient breaks were promptly repaired and DNA continued to replicate at a slow pace in the presence of replication inhibitors. In cells that lacked BLM, Mus81, or ATR, transient breaks did not form, DNA replication did not resume, and exposure to low doses of replication inhibitors was toxic. These observations suggest that BLM helicase, ATR kinase, and Mus81 nuclease are required to convert perturbed replication forks to DNA breaks when cells encounter conditions that decelerate DNA replication, thereby leading to the rapid repair of those breaks and resumption of DNA replication without incurring DNA damage and without activating a cell cycle checkpoint.",M1
18003860,"Novel pro- and anti-recombination activities of the Bloom's syndrome helicase.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a strong cancer predisposition. The defining feature of BS is extreme genome instability. The gene mutated in Bloom's syndrome, <e>BLM</e>, encodes a DNA helicase (BLM) of the RecQ family. BLM plays a role in homologous recombination; however, its exact function remains controversial. Mutations in the BLM cause hyperrecombination between sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes, indicating an anti-recombination role. Conversely, other data show that BLM is required for recombination. It was previously shown that in vitro BLM helicase promotes disruption of recombination intermediates, regression of stalled replication forks, and dissolution of double Holliday junctions. Here, we demonstrate two novel activities of BLM: disruption of the Rad51-ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) filament, an active species that promotes homologous recombination, and stimulation of DNA repair synthesis. Using in vitro reconstitution reactions, we analyzed how different biochemical activities of BLM contribute to its functions in homologous recombination.",M1
17923529,"Functional interactions between <e>BLM</e> and XRCC3 in the cell.Bloom's syndrome (BS), which is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, is characterized by a predisposition to a wide variety of cancers. BS cells exhibit elevated frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), interchanges between homologous chromosomes (mitotic chiasmata), and sensitivity to several DNA-damaging agents. To address the mechanism that confers these phenotypes in BS cells, we characterize a series of double and triple mutants with mutations in BLM and in other genes involved in repair pathways. We found that XRCC3 activity generates substrates that cause the elevated SCE in blm cells and that BLM with DNA topoisomerase IIIalpha suppresses the formation of SCE. In addition, XRCC3 activity also generates the ultraviolet (UV)- and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced mitotic chiasmata. Moreover, disruption of XRCC3 suppresses MMS and UV sensitivity and the MMS- and UV-induced chromosomal aberrations of blm cells, indicating that BLM acts downstream of XRCC3.",M1
17900800,"Genetic variant of the human homologous recombination-associated gene RMI1 (S455N) impacts the risk of AML/MDS and malignant melanoma.The newly identified protein BLAP75/RMI1 associates with the helicase <e>BLM</e> and is critical for the function of the homologous recombination complex. Mutations altering BLM function are associated with highly elevated cancer susceptibility (Bloom's syndrome). We have analyzed the common polymorphism Ser455Asn in RMI1 and its association with cancer risk in acute myeloid leukemia (AML, N=93), myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS, N=74), and malignant melanoma (MM, N=166). Two control groups were used: one population-based (N=119) and one recruited from spouses of cancer patients (N=189). The results showed a consistent pattern, where carriers of the Asn variant had a significantly increased risk of AML/MDS. The risk of AML/MDS for SerAsn+AsnAsn subjects was odds ratio (OR)=1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.5 or MM was OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2. Age might modify the effect of RMI1 on cancer risk. This was most evident for MM: AsnAsn homozygotes &gt; or =64 years showed OR=2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.0, whereas individuals &lt;64 years showed OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.31-2.5. These results indicate a role of low-penetrance genes involved in BLM-associated homologous recombination for cancer risk.",M1
17878217,"Structural and functional analyses of disease-causing missense mutations in Bloom syndrome protein.Bloom syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and the early development of many types of cancer. Missense mutations have been identified in the <e>BLM</e> gene (encoding a RecQ helicase) in affected individuals, but the molecular mechanism and the structural basis of the effects of these mutations remain to be elucidated. We analysed five disease-causing missense mutations that are localized in the BLM helicase core region: Q672R, I841T, C878R, G891E and C901Y. The disease-causing mutants had low ATPase and helicase activities but their ATP binding abilities were normal, except for Q672, whose ATP binding activity was lower than that of the intact BLM helicase. Mutants C878R, mapping near motif IV, and G891E and C901Y, mapping in motif IV, displayed severe DNA-binding defects. We used molecular modelling to analyse these mutations. Our work provides insights into the molecular basis of BLM pathology, and reveals structural elements implicated in coupling DNA binding to ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding. Our findings will help to explain the mechanism underlying BLM catalysis and interpreting new BLM causing mutations identified in the future.",M1
17728255,"Holliday junction processing activity of the <e>BLM</e>-Topo IIIalpha-BLAP75 complex.BLM, the protein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, possesses a helicase activity that can dissociate DNA structures, including the Holliday junction, expected to arise during homologous recombination. BLM is stably associated with topoisomerase IIIalpha (Topo IIIalpha) and the BLAP75 protein. The BLM-Topo IIIalpha-BLAP75 (BTB) complex can efficiently resolve a DNA substrate that harbors two Holliday junctions (the double Holliday junction) in a non-crossover manner. Here we show that the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM is greatly enhanced as a result of its association with Topo IIIalpha and BLAP75. Enhancement of this BLM activity requires both Topo IIIalpha and BLAP75. Importantly, Topo IIIalpha cannot be substituted by Escherichia coli Top3, and the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM-related helicases WRN and RecQ is likewise impervious to Topo IIIalpha and BLAP75. However, the topoisomerase activity of Topo IIIalpha is dispensable for the enhancement of the DNA unwinding reaction. We have also ascertained the requirement for the BLM ATPase activity in double Holliday junction dissolution and DNA unwinding by constructing, purifying, and characterizing specific mutant variants that lack this activity. These results provide valuable information concerning how the functional integrity of the BTB complex is governed by specific protein-protein interactions among the components of this complex and the enzymatic activities of BLM and Topo IIIalpha.",M1
17634426,"Endogenous gamma-H2AX-ATM-Chk2 checkpoint activation in Bloom's syndrome helicase deficient cells is related to DNA replication arrested forks.The Bloom syndrome helicase (<e>BLM</e>) is critical for genomic stability. A defect in BLM activity results in the cancer-predisposing Bloom syndrome (BS). Here, we report that BLM-deficient cell lines and primary fibroblasts display an endogenously activated DNA double-strand break checkpoint response with prominent levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX), Chk2 (p(T68)Chk2), and ATM (p(S1981)ATM) colocalizing in nuclear foci. Interestingly, the mitotic fraction of gamma-H2AX foci did not seem to be higher in BLM-deficient cells, indicating that these lesions form transiently during interphase. Pulse labeling with iododeoxyuridine and immunofluorescence microscopy showed the colocalization of gamma-H2AX, ATM, and Chk2 together with replication foci. Those foci costained for Rad51, indicating homologous recombination at these replication sites. We therefore analyzed replication in BS cells using a single molecule approach on combed DNA fibers. In addition to a higher frequency of replication fork barriers, BS cells displayed a reduced average fork velocity and global reduction of interorigin distances indicative of an elevated frequency of origin firing. Because BS is one of the most penetrant cancer-predisposing hereditary diseases, it is likely that the lack of BLM engages the cells in a situation similar to precancerous tissues with replication stress. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high ATM-Chk2 kinase activation and its linkage to replication defects in a BS model.",M1
17630856,"Absence of p53 enhances growth defects and etoposide sensitivity of human cells lacking the Bloom syndrome helicase <e>BLM</e>.The Bloom syndrome helicase BLM and the tumor-suppressor protein p53 play important roles in preserving genome integrity. Here, we knock out the genes for BLM and p53 in a human pre-B-cell line, Nalm-6. We show that p53 plays an important role in cell proliferation, but not apoptosis, when BLM is absent. Intriguingly, despite the apoptotic function of p53, BLM(/)TP53(/) cells were more sensitive than either single mutant to etoposide, an anticancer agent that poisons DNA topoisomerase II. Our results suggest a direct, BLM-independent role for p53 in etoposide-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage in human cells.",M1
17599064,"<e>BLM</e> is required for faithful chromosome segregation and its localization defines a class of ultrafine anaphase bridges.Mutations in BLM cause Bloom's syndrome, a disorder associated with cancer predisposition and chromosomal instability. We investigated whether BLM plays a role in ensuring the faithful chromosome segregation in human cells. We show that BLM-defective cells display a higher frequency of anaphase bridges and lagging chromatin than do isogenic corrected derivatives that eptopically express the BLM protein. In normal cells undergoing mitosis, BLM protein localizes to anaphase bridges, where it colocalizes with its cellular partners, topoisomerase IIIalpha and hRMI1 (BLAP75). Using BLM staining as a marker, we have identified a class of ultrafine DNA bridges in anaphase that are surprisingly prevalent in the anaphase population of normal human cells. These so-called BLM-DNA bridges, which also stain for the PICH protein, frequently link centromeric loci, and are present at an elevated frequency in cells lacking BLM. On the basis of these results, we propose that sister-chromatid disjunction is often incomplete in human cells even after the onset of anaphase. We present a model for the action of BLM in ensuring complete sister chromatid decatenation in anaphase.",M1
17507683,"Multiple functions of Drosophila <e>BLM</e> helicase in maintenance of genome stability.Bloom Syndrome, a rare human disorder characterized by genomic instability and predisposition to cancer, is caused by mutation of BLM, which encodes a RecQ-family DNA helicase. The Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of BLM, DmBlm, is encoded by mus309. Mutations in mus309 cause hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, female sterility, and defects in repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs). To better understand these phenotypes, we isolated novel mus309 alleles. Mutations that delete the N terminus of DmBlm, but not the helicase domain, have DSB repair defects as severe as those caused by null mutations. We found that female sterility is due to a requirement for DmBlm in early embryonic cell cycles; embryos lacking maternally derived DmBlm have anaphase bridges and other mitotic defects. These defects were less severe for the N-terminal deletion alleles, so we used one of these mutations to assay meiotic recombination. Crossovers were decreased to about half the normal rate, and the remaining crossovers were evenly distributed along the chromosome. We also found that spontaneous mitotic crossovers are increased by several orders of magnitude in mus309 mutants. These results demonstrate that DmBlm functions in multiple cellular contexts to promote genome stability.",M1

Since the molecular isolation of BLM, characterization of BS-causing mutations has been carried out systematically using samples stored in the Bloom's Syndrome Registry. In a survey of 134 persons with BS from the Registry, 64 different mutations were identified in 125 of them, 54 that cause premature protein-translation termination and 10 missense mutations. In 102 of the 125 persons in whom at least one BLM mutation was identified, the mutation was recurrent, that is, it was shared by two or more persons with BS; 19 of the 64 different mutations were recurrent. Ethnic affiliations of the persons who carry recurrent mutations indicate that the majority of such persons inherit their BLM mutation identical-by-descent from a recent common ancestor, a founder. The presence of widespread founder mutations in persons with BS points to population genetic processes that repeatedly and pervasively generate mutations that recur in unrelated persons.",M1
17363339,"Role of the <e>BLM</e> helicase in replication fork management.Genomic DNA is particularly vulnerable to mutation during S-phase when the two strands of parental duplex DNA are separated during the process of semi-conservative DNA replication. Lesions that are normally repaired efficiently in the context of double stranded DNA can cause replication forks to stall or, more dangerously, collapse. Cells from Bloom's syndrome patients, that lack the RecQ helicase BLM, show defects in the response to replicative stress and contain a multitude of chromosomal aberrations, which primarily arise through excessive levels of homologous recombination. Here, recent findings are reviewed that further our understanding of the role that BLM plays in the management of damaged replication forks.",M1
17321898,"Differential expression of Werner and Bloom syndrome genes in the peripheral blood of HIV-1 infected patients.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced immunodeficiency and immune-system aging share some analogies. Since Werner (WRN) and Bloom (<e>BLM</e>) helicases are crucial in cell repair and aging, their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) mRNA levels were compared in HIV-1 infected patients and in normal donors. The mean levels of WRN mRNA were 3.7-fold higher in PBMCs from HIV-1 infected individuals in comparison to healthy donors, whereas BLM mRNA mean levels were slightly higher, although not significantly. WRN increase was positively correlated to CD4 and CD8 T-cell numbers, and also the percentage of naive T lymphocytes, and was observed also in T-cell subsets. Interestingly, a general trend toward increased WRN mRNA levels in individuals with lower viral load was observed, without association with patient age, time of seroconversion, and on/off antiretroviral therapy regimen. On the whole, this study shows that WRN and BLM are differentially modulated in HIV infection, as WRN--but not BLM--is significantly increased, suggesting that mechanisms different from defect or loss of helicase function, observed in WRN and BLM syndromes, may be at the basis of T-cell aging in HIV infection.",M1
16926856,"Mechanism of homologous recombination: mediators and helicases take on regulatory functions.Homologous recombination (HR) is an important mechanism for the repair of damaged chromosomes, for preventing the demise of damaged replication forks, and for several other aspects of chromosome maintenance. As such, HR is indispensable for genome integrity, but it must be regulated to avoid deleterious events. Mutations in the tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2, which has a mediator function in HR, lead to cancer formation. DNA helicases, such as Bloom's syndrome protein (<e>BLM</e>), regulate HR at several levels, in attenuating unwanted HR events and in determining the outcome of HR. Defects in BLM are also associated with the cancer phenotype. The past several years have witnessed dramatic advances in our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of HR.",M1
16876111,"<e>BLM</e> is an early responder to DNA double-strand breaks.Bloom syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a marked predisposition to cancer and elevated genomic instability. The defective protein in BS, BLM, is a member of the RecQ helicase family and is believed to function in various DNA transactions, including in replication, repair, and recombination. Here, we show that both endogenous and overexpressed human BLM accumulates at sites of laser light-induced DNA double-strand breaks within 10s and colocalizes with gammaH2AX and ATM. Like its RecQ helicase family member, WRN, the defective protein in Werner syndrome, dissection of the BLM protein revealed that its HRDC domain is sufficient for its recruitment to the damaged sites. In addition, we confirmed that the C-terminal region spanning amino acids 1250-1292 within the HRDC domain is necessary for BLM recruitment. To identify additional proteins required for the recruitment of BLM, we examined the recruitment of BLM in various mutants generated from chicken DT40 cells and found that the early accumulation of BLM was not dependent on the presence of ATM, RAD17, DNA-PKcs, NBS1, XRCC3, RAD52, RAD54, or WRN. Thus, HRDC domain in DNA helicases is a common early responder to DNA double-strand breaks, enabling BLM and WRN to be involved in DNA repair.",M1
16864798,"MPS1-dependent mitotic <e>BLM</e> phosphorylation is important for chromosome stability.Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures bipolar attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and is essential for faithful chromosome segregation, thereby preventing chromosome instability (CIN). Genetic evidence suggests a causal link between compromised SAC, CIN, and cancer. Bloom syndrome (BS) is a genetic disorder that predisposes affected individuals to cancer. BS cells exhibit elevated rates of sister chromatid exchange, chromosome breaks, and CIN. The BS gene product, BLM, is a member of the RecQ helicases that are required for maintenance of genome stability. The BLM helicase interacts with proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair and is required for the repair of stalled-replication forks and in the DNA damage response. Here we present biochemical evidence to suggest a role of BLM phosphorylation during mitosis in maintaining chromosome stability. BLM is associated with the SAC kinase MPS1 and is phosphorylated at S144 in a MPS1-dependent manner. Phosphorylated BLM interacts with polo-like kinase 1, a mitotic kinase that binds to phosphoserine/threonine through its polo-box domain (PBD). Furthermore, BS cells expressing BLM-S144A show normal levels of sister chromatid exchange but fail to maintain the mitotic arrest when SAC is activated and exhibit a broad distribution of chromosome numbers. We propose that MPS1-dependent BLM phosphorylation is important for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, and its deregulation may contribute to cancer.",M1
16858412,"Tumor suppressor gene identification using retroviral insertional mutagenesis in <e>Blm</e>-deficient mice.Retroviral insertional mutagenesis preferentially identifies oncogenes rather than tumor suppressor (TS) genes, presumably because a single retroviral-induced mutation is sufficient to activate an oncogene and initiate a tumor, whereas two mutations are needed to inactivate a TS gene. Here we show that TS genes can be identified by insertional mutagenesis when the screens are performed in Blm-deficient backgrounds. Blm-deficient mice, like Bloom syndrome patients, have increased frequencies of mitotic recombination owing to a mutation in the RecQ protein-like-3 helicase gene. This increased mitotic recombination increases the likelihood that an insertional mutation in one allele of a TS gene will become homozygoused by non-sister chromatid exchange and the homozygosity of the insertion provides a marker for identifying the TS gene. We also show that known as well as novel TS genes can be identified by insertional mutagenesis in Blm-deficient mice and identify two JmjC family proteins that contribute to genome stability in species as evolutionarily diverse as mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans.",M1

Sgs1 and mismatch repair (MMR) are inhibitors of recombination between similar but divergent (homeologous) DNA sequences. Here we show that SGS1, but not MMR, is critical for suppressing spontaneous, recurring translocations between diverged genes in cells with mutations in the genes encoding the checkpoint proteins Mec3, Rad24, Rad9, or Rfc5, the chromatin assembly factors Cac1 or Asf1, and the DNA helicase Rrm3. The S-phase checkpoint kinase and telomere maintenance factor Tel1, a homolog of the human ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) protein, prevents these translocations, whereas the checkpoint kinase Mec1, a homolog of the human ATM-related protein, and the Rad53 checkpoint kinase are not required.

16537486,"BLAP75/RMI1 promotes the <e>BLM</e>-dependent dissolution of homologous recombination intermediates.BLM encodes a member of the highly conserved RecQ DNA helicase family, which is essential for the maintenance of genome stability. Homozygous inactivation of BLM gives rise to the cancer predisposition disorder Bloom's syndrome. A common feature of many RecQ helicase mutants is a hyperrecombination phenotype. In Bloom's syndrome, this phenotype manifests as an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and interhomologue recombination. We have shown previously that BLM, together with its evolutionarily conserved binding partner topoisomerase IIIalpha (hTOPO IIIalpha), can process recombination intermediates that contain double Holliday junctions into noncrossover products by a mechanism termed dissolution. Here we show that a recently identified third component of the human BLM/hTOPO IIIalpha complex, BLAP75/RMI1, promotes dissolution catalyzed by hTOPO IIIalpha. This activity of BLAP75/RMI1 is specific for dissolution catalyzed by hTOPO IIIalpha because it has no effect in reactions containing either Escherichia coli Top1 or Top3, both of which can also catalyze dissolution in a BLM-dependent manner. We present evidence that BLAP75/RMI1 acts by recruiting hTOPO IIIalpha to double Holliday junctions. Implications of the conserved ability of type IA topoisomerases to catalyze dissolution and how the evolution of factors such as BLAP75/RMI1 might confer specificity on the execution of this process are discussed.",M1

We tested the hypothesis whether three polymorphic, non-conservative amino acid exchanges in WRN and BLM act as low-penetrance familial breast cancer risk factors. Moreover, we examined the putative impact of p53 MspI 1798G&gt;A, which is completely linked to p53PIN3, a 16 bp insertion/duplication that has been associated with reduced p53 expression, on familial breast cancer risk. Genotyping analyses, performed on 816 BRCA1/2 mutation-negative German familial breast cancer patients and 1012 German controls, revealed a significant association of the WRN Cys1367Arg polymorphism with familial breast cancer (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54) and high-risk familial breast cancer (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.06-1.65). The analysis of p53 MspI 1798G&gt;A, which is completely linked to p53PIN3, showed a significantly increased familial breast cancer risk for carriers of the 16 bp insertion/duplication, following a recessive mode (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.12-4.11). WRN Cys1367Arg, located in the C-terminus, the binding site of p53, is predicted to be damaging. The joint effect of WRN Cys1367Arg and p53 MspI resulted in an increased breast cancer risk compared to the single polymorphisms (OR = 3.39, 95% CI 1.19-9.71). In conclusion, our study indicates the importance of inherited variants in the WRN and p53 genes for familial breast cancer susceptibility.",M1
16412221,"Competition between the DNA unwinding and strand pairing activities of the Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins.BACKGROUND: The premature aging and cancer-prone Werner and Bloom syndromes are caused by defects in the RecQ helicase enzymes WRN and <e>BLM</e>, respectively. Recently, both WRN and BLM (as well as several other RecQ members) have been shown to possess a strand annealing activity in addition to the requisite DNA unwinding activity. Since an annealing function would appear to directly oppose the action of a helicase, we have examined in this study the dynamic equilibrium between unwinding and annealing mediated by either WRN or BLM. RESULTS: Our investigation into the competition between annealing and unwinding demonstrates that, under standard reaction conditions, WRN- or BLM-mediated annealing can partially or completely mask unwinding as measured in standard helicase assays. Several strategies were employed to suppress the annealing activity so that the actual strength of WRN- or BLM-dependent unwinding could be more accurately assessed. Interestingly, if a DNA oligomer complementary to one strand of the DNA substrate to be unwound is added during the helicase reaction, both WRN and BLM unwinding is enhanced, presumably by preventing protein-mediated re-annealing. This strategy allowed measurement of WRN-catalyzed unwinding of long (80 base pair) duplex regions and fully complementary, blunt-ended duplexes, both of which were otherwise quite refractory to the helicase activity of WRN. Similarly, the addition of trap strand stimulated the ability of BLM to unwind long and blunt-ended duplexes. The stimulatory effect of the human replication protein A (hRPA, the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein) on both WRN- and BLM-dependent unwinding was also re-examined in light of its possible role in preventing re-annealing. Our results show that hRPA influences the outcome of WRN and BLM helicase assays by both inhibiting re-annealing and directly promoting unwinding, with the larger contribution from the latter mechanism. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that measurements of unwinding by WRN, BLM, and probably other RecQ helicases are complicated by their annealing properties. Thus, WRN- and BLM-dependent unwinding activities are significantly stronger than previously believed. Since this broadens the range of potential physiological substrates for WRN and BLM, our findings have relevance for understanding their functions in vitro and in vivo.",M1
16387452,"Bloom's syndrome gene-deficient phenotype in mouse primary cells induced by a modified tetracycline-controlled trans-silencer.We recently reported genome-wide bi-allelic mutagenesis and phenotype-based genetic screening by tetracycline-regulated disruption of the Bloom's syndrome gene (<e>Blm</e>) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the same approach was hampered in mouse tissues owing to leaky expression of the Blm gene, which is the major obstacle in the tetracycline regulatory system. Here we describe a single-chain reverse tetracycline-controlled trans-silencer (sc rtTS) which reduces leaky expression in the tet-off system. The sc rtTS consists of two silencer moieties linked by a 36 amino acid linker. Although the silencer moiety contained a dimerization domain compatible with the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), heterodimerization with tTA was prevented because intramolecular self-assembly between linked silencer moieties was preferred. The system was applied to mouse splenic lymphocytes and elevation of sister chromatid exchange, the hallmark of Blm dysfunction, was observed in the presence of doxycycline. A cassette containing both sc rtTS and tTA was introduced into the Blm allele in ES cells and reduction of basal activity was observed upon doxycycline treatment. Our data demonstrate effectiveness of sc rtTS in the tet-off system. Application of sc rtTS in mice may allow us to implement bi-allelic mutagenesis in vivo.",M1
16288211,"Redundancy of DNA helicases in p53-mediated apoptosis.A subset of DNA helicases, the RecQ family, has been found to be associated with the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway and is involved in maintaining genomic integrity. This family contains the <e>BLM</e> and WRN helicases, in which germline mutations are responsible for Bloom and Werner syndromes, respectively. TFIIH DNA helicases, XPB and XPD, are also components in this apoptotic pathway. We hypothesized that there may be some redundancy between helicases in their ability to complement the attenuated p53-mediated apoptotic levels seen in cells from individuals with diseases associated with these defective helicase genes. The attenuated apoptotic phenotype in Bloom syndrome cells was rescued not only by ectopic expression of BLM, but also by WRN or XPB, both 3' --&gt; 5' helicases, but not expression of the 5' --&gt; 3' helicase XPD. Overexpression of Sgs1, a WRN/BLM yeast homolog, corrected the reduction in BS cells only, which is consistent with Sgs1 being evolutionarily most homologous to BLM. A restoration of apoptotic levels in cells from WS, XPB or XPD patients was attained only by overexpression of the specific helicase. Our data suggest a limited redundancy in the pathways of these RecQ helicases in p53-induced apoptosis.",M1

Of the five known human RecQ family members, three (<e>BLM</e>, WRN and RECQ4, which cause Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome respectively) are mutated in distinct clinical disorders associated with cancer predisposition and/or premature aging. BLM forms part of a multienzyme complex including topoisomerase IIIalpha, replication protein A and a newly identified factor called BLAP75. Together, these proteins play a role in the resolution of DNA structures that arise during the process of homologous recombination repair.

16199871,"Phosphorylation of <e>BLM</e>, dissociation from topoisomerase IIIalpha, and colocalization with gamma-H2AX after topoisomerase I-induced replication damage.Topoisomerase I-associated DNA single-strand breaks selectively trapped by camptothecins are lethal after being converted to double-strand breaks by replication fork collisions. BLM (Bloom's syndrome protein), a RecQ DNA helicase, and topoisomerase IIIalpha (Top3alpha) appear essential for the resolution of stalled replication forks (Holliday junctions). We investigated the involvement of BLM in the signaling response to Top1-mediated replication DNA damage. In BLM-complemented cells, BLM colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies and Top3alpha. Fibroblasts without BLM showed an increased sensitivity to camptothecin, enhanced formation of Top1-DNA complexes, and delayed histone H2AX phosphorylation (gamma-H2AX). Camptothecin also induced nuclear relocalization of BLM, Top3alpha, and PML protein and replication-dependent phosphorylation of BLM on threonine 99 (T99p-BLM). T99p-BLM was also observed following replication stress induced by hydroxyurea. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and AT- and Rad9-related protein kinases, but not DNA-dependent protein kinase, appeared to play a redundant role in phosphorylating BLM. Following camptothecin treatment, T99p-BLM colocalized with gamma-H2AX but not with Top3alpha or PML. Thus, BLM appears to dissociate from Top3alpha and PML following its phosphorylation and facilitates H2AX phosphorylation in response to replication double-strand breaks induced by Top1. A defect in gamma-H2AX signaling in response to unrepaired replication-mediated double-strand breaks might, at least in part, explain the camptothecin-sensitivity of BLM-deficient cells.",M1

Loss of BLM function results in genomic instability that causes a high incidence of cancer. It has been demonstrated that BLM is important for maintaining genomic stability by playing a role in DNA recombination and repair; however, the exact function of BLM is not clearly understood. To determine the mechanism by which BLM controls genomic stability in vivo, we examined the phenotypes caused by mutation of the C. elegans BLM helicase ortholog, HIM-6. We find that the loss of HIM-6 leads to genomic instability as evidenced by an increased number of genomic insertions and deletions, which results in visible random mutant phenotypes. In addition to the mutator phenotype, him-6 mutants have a low brood size, a high incidence of males, a shortened life span, and an increased amount of germ line apoptosis. Upon exposure to high temperature, him-6 mutants that are serially passed become sterile demonstrating a mortal germ line phenotype. Our data suggest a model in which loss of HIM-6 results in genomic instability due to an increased number of DNA lesions, which either cannot be repaired and/or are introduced by low fidelity recombination events. The increased level of genomic instability that leads to him-6(ok412) mutants having a shortened life span.",M1

Here, we show that dissolution is highly specific for BLM among human RecQ helicases and critically depends upon a functional HRDC domain in BLM. We show that the HRDC domain confers DNA structure specificity, and is required for the efficient binding to and unwinding of double Holliday junctions, but not for the unwinding of a simple partial duplex substrate. Furthermore, we show that lysine-1270 of BLM, which resides in the HRDC domain and is predicted to play a role in mediating interactions with DNA, is required for efficient dissolution.",M1

Several studies have demonstrated that <e>BLM</e> is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and stalled replication forks. BLM interacts physically and functionally with several proteins involved in the maintenance of genome integrity and BLM is redistributed and/or phosphorylated in response to several genotoxic stresses. The data concerning the relationship between BLM and these cellular pathways are summarized and the role of BLM in the rescue of arrested replication forks is discussed. Moreover, I speculate that BLM deficiency is lethal, and that BLM-deficient cells escaping apoptotic death do so by constitutively inducing a bacterial SOS-like response including the induction of alternative replication pathway(s) dependent on recombination, contributing to the mutator and hyper-Rec phenotypes characteristic of BS cells. This mechanism may be dependent on the RAD51 gene family, and involved in carcinogenesis in the general population.",M1
15831450,"Recql5 and <e>Blm</e> RecQ DNA helicases have nonredundant roles in suppressing crossovers.In eukaryotes, crossovers in mitotic cells can have deleterious consequences and therefore must be suppressed. Mutations in BLM give rise to Bloom syndrome, a disease that is characterized by an elevated rate of crossovers and increased cancer susceptibility. However, simple eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have multiple pathways for suppressing crossovers, suggesting that mammals also have multiple pathways for controlling crossovers in their mitotic cells. We show here that in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, mutations in either the Bloom syndrome homologue (Blm) or the Recql5 genes result in a significant increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), whereas deleting both Blm and Recql5 lead to an even higher frequency of SCE. These data indicate that Blm and Recql5 have nonredundant roles in suppressing crossovers in mouse ES cells. Furthermore, we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Recql5 knockout mice also exhibit a significantly increased frequency of SCE compared with the corresponding wild-type control. Thus, this study identifies a previously unknown Recql5-dependent, Blm-independent pathway for suppressing crossovers during mitosis in mice.",M1

Here we demonstrate that BLAP75, a novel protein containing a putative OB-fold nucleic acid binding domain, is an integral component of BLM complexes, and is essential for their stability in vivo. Consistent with a role in BLM-mediated processes, BLAP75 colocalizes with BLM in subnuclear foci in response to DNA damage, and its depletion impairs the recruitment of BLM to these foci. Depletion of BLAP75 by siRNA also results in deficient phosphorylation of BLM during mitosis, as well as defective cell proliferation. Moreover, cells depleted of BLAP75 display an increased level of sister-chromatid exchange, similar to cells depleted of BLM by siRNA.

Both syndromes are relatively prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and, in both syndromes, mutations specific to this population have been identified. Similarly, unique Ashkenazi mutations were found in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. These two genes, when mutated, play important roles in familial breast and ovarian carcinogenesis. The genes involved in the pathogenesis of the FA and BS belong to the general class of instability genes. Heterozygosity for the FA gene has no known promalignant potential, while the BS mutation carrier state was associated with an increased frequency of colorectal cancer. The especially frequent carrier state among the Ashkenazi Jewish population coupled with the high prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the same population has led us to search for coinheritance affecting the potential for cancer development. One hundred Ashkenazi women with known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were screened for the FA mutation IVS4+4 A--&gt;T and the BS mutation <e>blm</e>(Ash).

Flaps that can form secondary structure inhibit even wild-type FEN1 and are more likely to form bubbles. Although proliferating cell nuclear antigen stimulates FEN1, it cannot resolve secondary structures. Bloom protein (<e>BLM</e>) is a 3'-5' helicase, mutated in Bloom syndrome. BLM has been reported to interact with and stimulate FEN1 independent of helicase function. We found activation of the helicase by ATP did not alter BLM stimulation of cleavage of unstructured flaps. However, BLM stimulation of FEN1 cleavage of foldback flaps, bubbles, or triplet repeats was increased by an additional increment when ATP was added. Helicase-dependent stimulation of FEN1 cleavage was robust over a range of sizes of the single-stranded part of bubbles. However, increasing the length of the 5' annealed region of the bubble ultimately counteracted the stimulatory capacity of the BLM helicase. Moderate helicase-dependent stimulation was observed with both fixed and equilibrating CTG flaps. Our results suggest that BLM suppresses genome instability by aiding FEN1 cleavage of structure-containing flaps.",M1
15520224,"Localization of cancer susceptibility genes by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage-disequilibrium mapping.With the large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available and new technologies that permit high throughput genotyping, we have investigated the possibility of the localization of disease genes with genome-wide panels of SNP markers and taking advantage of the linkage-disequilibrium (LD) between the disease gene and closely linked markers. For this purpose, we selected cases from the Ashkenazi Jewish population, in which the mutant alleles are expected to be identical by descent from a common founder and the regions of LD encompassing these mutant alleles are large. As a validation of this approach for localization, we performed two trials: one in autosomal recessive Bloom syndrome, in which a unique mutation of the <e>BLM</e> gene is present at elevated frequencies in cases, and the other in autosomal dominant hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), in which a unique mutation of MSH2 is present at elevated frequencies. In the Bloom syndrome trial, we genotyped 3,258 SNPs in 10 Jewish Bloom syndrome cases and 31 non-Bloom syndrome Jewish persons as a comparison group. In the HNPCC trial, we genotyped 8,549 SNPS in 13 Jewish HNPCC cases whose colon cancers exhibited microsatellite instability and in 63 healthy Jews as a comparison group. To identify significant associations, we performed (a) Fisher's exact test comparing genotypes at each locus in cases versus controls and (b) a haplotype analysis by estimating the frequency of haplotypes with the expectation-maximization algorithm and comparing haplotype frequencies in cases versus controls by logistic regression and a maximum likelihood ratio method. In the Bloom syndrome trial, by Fisher's exact test, statistically significant association was detected at a single locus, TSC0754862, which is a locus 1.7 million bp from BLM. Two-locus, three-locus, and four-locus haplotypes that included TSC0754862 and flanked BLM were also statistically more frequent in cases versus controls. In the HNPCC trial, although a significant P value was not obtained by the single SNP genotype analysis, significant associations were detected for several multilocus haplotypes in an 11-million-bp region that contained the MSH2 gene. This work demonstrates the power of the LD mapping approach in an isolated population and its general applicability to the identification of novel cancer-causing genes.",M1
15498034,"Expression of Werner and Bloom syndrome genes is differentially regulated by in vitro HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.In HIV infection, continuous immune activation leads to accelerated ageing of the adaptive immune system, similar to that observed in elderly people. We investigated the expression of WRN and <e>BLM</e> (genes involved in disorders characterized by premature ageing, genomic instability and cancer predisposition) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated in vitro with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and infected with different HIV-1 strains. The steady state levels of mRNA were analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein expression was assayed using immunocytochemistry and Western blot techniques. In uninfected PBMC, PHA stimulation induced an increase in BLM mRNA and protein expression, while WRN expression remained virtually unchanged. When PBMC were infected in vitro with a lymphotropic HIV-1 strain, the level of BLM mRNA showed a peak at 24 h of infection, followed by a decline to uninfected culture levels. A similar result failed to be seen using an R5-tropic HIV-1 strain. In accordance with mRNA expression, in HIV-infected cultures PBMC were stained more frequently and more intensely by a BLM-specific antibody as compared to uninfected cultures, staining peaking at 24. Conversely, WRN expression was not modulated by HIV-1. The proportion of cells showing BLM up-regulation, established by immunocytochemical staining, was much greater than the proportion of productively infected PBMC, as established by proviral DNA measurement. This result indicates that BLM up-regulation is probably a result of an indirect bystander cell effect. Activation of the BLM gene in infected PBMC suggests that premature ageing could be a further immunopathogenetic mechanism involved in HIV-induced immunodeficiency, and points to a possible new candidate target for innovative therapeutic intervention.",M1
15493327,"The function of RecQ helicase gene family (especially <e>BLM</e>) in DNA recombination and joining.Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by lupus-like erythematous telangiectasias of the face, sun sensitivity, stunted growth, and immunodeficiency. Chromosome instability syndromes have a common feature, being associated at high frequency with neoplasia. BS is considered as one of the chromosome instability syndromes since the fibroblasts or lymphocytes of BS patients show excessive spontaneous chromosome instability. The causative gene of BS (BLM) was identified as a RecQ helicase homologue. In this review, we showed the characteristic phenotypes of BS, especially two Japanese siblings. In the latter of the review, the functional domains of BLM, those are nuclear localization signal and the interacting proteins such as ATM, are shown. Several lines of reports indicates that BLM helicase is involved in the re-initiation of DNA replication at sites where replication forks have arrested or collapsed. To elucidate the precise function of RecQ helicase in DNA repair and replication aims not only to improve our understanding of the molecular basis for tumorigenesis, but also to extend the range of potential therapeutic targets.",M1
15493326,"Genetic and physiological regulation of non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells.Repair of DSBs is important to prevent chromosomal fragmentation, translocations and deletions. To investigate the process in NHEJ, we have established an in vitro system to clarify the measurement and analysis of the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining of DSBs, and applied the method to investigate NHEJ in human cells derived from patients suffering from cancer-prone hereditary diseases. A DSB was introduced in plasmid pZErO-2 at a specific site within the ccdB gene that is lethal to E. coli cells, and treated with nuclear extracts from human cells. The efficiency of rejoining in the nuclear extract from an A-T cell line was comparable to that from a control cell line. However, the accuracy of rejoining was much lower for the A-T cell extract than for the control cell extract. All mutations were deletions, most of which contained short direct repeats at the breakpoint junctions. The deletion spectrum caused by the A-T nuclear extract was distinct from that by the control extract. These results indicate that A-T cells have certain deficiencies in end-joining of double-strand breaks in DNA. The extract from BS cells also showed the similar activity and the lower fidelity of rejoing compared to that from normal cells. From the sequencing analysis of the junction of DSBs, it is speculated that the defect in the <e>BLM</e> helicase might cause irregular rejoining of DSBs. Radioadaptive response is the acquirement of cellular resistance to ionizing radiation by prior exposure to low dose. We investigated the in vitro end-joining activity of DNA ends in radioadaptive cells. Both the efficiency and the fidelity of rejoining in the cells pre-exposed to low dose are increased comparing to those without pre-exposure. We also investigated the joining activity of DNA ends in p53-deficient cells. Pre-irradiation caused no apparent alteration in both the efficiency and fidelity of end-joining. These results suggest that the exposure to low dose activates a cellular function to repair DSBs efficiently, which is dependent on p53. These results indicate that NHEJ pathway is regulated by many factors; genetic regulation by ATM and BLM, and physiological conditions such as irradiation with ionizing radiation. The observations also suggest that in some occasions p53 might play a key role in NHEJ.",M1
15450411,"Spontaneous and induced chromosomal damage and mutations in Bloom Syndrome mice.Bloom Syndrome (BS) is characterized by both cancer and genomic instability, including chromosomal aberrations, sister chromosome exchanges, and mutations. Since BS heterozygotes are much more frequent than homozygotes, the issue of the sensitivity of heterozygotes to cancer is an important one. This and many other questions concerning the effects of <e>BLM</e> (the gene responsible for the BS) are more easily studied in mice than in humans. To gain insight into genomic instability associated with loss of function of BLM, which codes for a DNA helicase, we compared frequencies of micronuclei, somatic mutations, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Blmtm3Brd homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice carrying a cII transgenic reporter gene. It should be noted that the Blmtm3Brd is inserted into the endogenous locus with a partial duplication of the gene, so some function of the locus may be retained. The cII reporter gene was introduced from the Big Blue mouse by crossing them with Blmtm3Brd mice. All measurements were made on F2 mice from this cross. The reticulocytes of Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice had more micronuclei than heterozygous or wild-type mice (4.5, 2.7, and 2.5 per thousand, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) but heterozygotes did not differ significantly from wild-type. Unlike spontaneous chromosome damage, spontaneous mutant frequencies did not differ significantly among homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice (3.2 x 10(-5), 3.1 x 10(-5), and 3.1 x 10(-5), respectively; P &gt; 0.05). Mutation measurements were also made on mice that had been treated with ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) because Bloom Syndrome cells are sensitive to ethylating agents. The ENU-induced mutation frequency in Blmtm3Brd homozygous, heterozygous, and wild mice were 54 x 10(-5), 35 x 10(-5), and 25 x 10(-5) mutants/plaques, respectively. ENU induced more mutations in Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P &lt; 0.01), but not significantly more in heterozygous mice (P = 0.06). Spontaneous LOH did not differ significantly among the genotypes, but ENU treatment induced much more LOH in Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice, as measured by means of the Dlb-1 test of Vomiero-Highton and Heddle. Hence, these Blmtm3Brd mice resemble Bloom Syndrome except that they have normal frequencies of spontaneous mutation. The fact that these mice have elevated rates of both cancer and chromosomal aberrations (as shown by more micronuclei and LOH) but normal rates of spontaneous mutation, shows the greater importance of chromosomal events than mutations in the origin of their cancers.",M1
15367665,"Telomere shortening exposes functions for the mouse Werner and Bloom syndrome genes.The Werner and Bloom syndromes are caused by loss-of-function mutations in WRN and <e>BLM</e>, respectively, which encode the RecQ family DNA helicases WRN and BLM, respectively. Persons with Werner syndrome displays premature aging of the skin, vasculature, reproductive system, and bone, and those with Bloom syndrome display more limited features of aging, including premature menopause; both syndromes involve genome instability and increased cancer. The proteins participate in recombinational repair of stalled replication forks or DNA breaks, but the precise functions of the proteins that prevent rapid aging are unknown. Accumulating evidence points to telomeres as targets of WRN and BLM, but the importance in vivo of the proteins in telomere biology has not been tested. We show that Wrn and Blm mutations each accentuate pathology in later-generation mice lacking the telomerase RNA template Terc, including acceleration of phenotypes characteristic of latest-generation Terc mutants. Furthermore, pathology not observed in Terc mutants but similar to that observed in Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome, such as bone loss, was observed. The pathology was accompanied by enhanced telomere dysfunction, including end-to-end chromosome fusions and greater loss of telomere repeat DNA compared with Terc mutants. These findings indicate that telomere dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome.",M1
15364958,"Functional interaction between <e>BLM</e> helicase and 53BP1 in a Chk1-mediated pathway during S-phase arrest.Bloom's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by chromosomal aberrations, genetic instability, and cancer predisposition, all of which may be the result of abnormal signal transduction during DNA damage recognition. Here, we show that BLM is an intermediate responder to stalled DNA replication forks. BLM colocalized and physically interacted with the DNA damage response proteins 53BP1 and H2AX. Although BLM facilitated physical interaction between p53 and 53BP1, 53BP1 was required for efficient accumulation of both BLM and p53 at the sites of stalled replication. The accumulation of BLM/53BP1 foci and the physical interaction between them was independent of gamma-H2AX. The active Chk1 kinase was essential for both the accurate focal colocalization of 53BP1 with BLM and the consequent stabilization of BLM. Once the ATR/Chk1- and 53BP1-mediated signal from replicational stress is received, BLM functions in multiple downstream repair processes, thereby fulfilling its role as a caretaker tumor suppressor.",M1

We investigated the mutation in the BLM gene in 4 Japanese BS kindreds. Taken together with previously documented mutations, 2 kindreds were homozygous for 631delCAA and 2 were compound heterozygous for 631delCAA. The silent mutation of A1055C (Thr to Thr) was detected in control Japanese individuals. The 6-bp deletion/7-bp insertion at position 2,281, which most Askenazi Jewish BS patients carry, was not detected in 200 Japanese alleles. These results suggest that 631delCAA is a relatively common mutation among the Japanese BS patients.",M1

Here, we report that BLM and the FA pathway are activated in response to both crosslinked DNA and replication fork stall. We provide evidence that BLM and FANCD2 colocalise and co-immunoprecipitate following treatment with either DNA crosslinkers or agents inducing replication arrest. We also find that the FA core complex is necessary for BLM phosphorylation and assembly in nuclear foci in response to crosslinked DNA. Moreover, we show that knock-down of the MRE11 complex, whose function is also under the control of the FA core complex, enhances cellular and chromosomal sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks in BS cells. These findings suggest the existence of a functional link between BLM and the FA pathway and that BLM and the MRE11 complex are in two separated branches of a pathway resulting in S-phase checkpoint activation, chromosome integrity and cell survival in response to crosslinked DNA.",M1
15197177,"Absence of <e>BLM</e> leads to accumulation of chromosomal DNA breaks during both unperturbed and disrupted S phases.Bloom's syndrome (BS), a disorder associated with genomic instability and cancer predisposition, results from defects in the Bloom's helicase (BLM) protein. In BS cells, chromosomal abnormalities such as sister chromatid exchanges occur at highly elevated rates. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we have studied Xenopus BLM (Xblm) during both unperturbed and disrupted DNA replication cycles. Xblm binds to replicating chromatin and becomes highly phosphorylated in the presence of DNA replication blocks. This phosphorylation depends on Xenopus ATR (Xatr) and Xenopus Rad17 (Xrad17), but not Claspin. Xblm and Xenopus topoisomerase IIIalpha (Xtop3alpha) interact in a regulated manner and associate with replicating chromatin interdependently. Immunodepletion of Xblm from egg extracts results in accumulation of chromosomal DNA breaks during both normal and perturbed DNA replication cycles. Disruption of the interaction between Xblm and Xtop3alpha has similar effects. The occurrence of DNA damage in the absence of Xblm, even without any exogenous insult to the DNA, may help to explain the genesis of chromosomal defects in BS cells.",M1
15184650,"Interplay between Drosophila Bloom's syndrome helicase and Ku autoantigen during nonhomologous end joining repair of P element-induced DNA breaks.P transposable elements in Drosophila are mobilized via a cut-and-paste mechanism. The broken DNA ends generated during transposition can be repaired via the homology-directed synthesis-dependent strand annealing or by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Genetic studies have demonstrated an interaction between the gene (mus309, for mutagen-sensitive) encoding the Drosophila Bloom's syndrome helicase homolog (DmBLM) and the Ku70 gene, which is involved in NHEJ. We have used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down expression of DmBLM and one or both of the Drosophila Ku subunits, DmKu70 or DmKu80. Our results show that upon reduction of DmKu, an increase in small deletions (1-49 bp) and large deletions (&gt;/=50 bp) flanking the site of P element-induced breaks is observed, and a reduction in large deletions at these sites is found upon reduction of DmBLM. Moreover, double RNAi of DmKu and DmBLM results in an increase in small deletions characteristic of the DmKu RNAi and also partially suppresses the reduction in repair efficiency observed with DmKu RNAi. These results suggest that there are DNA double-strand break recognition and/or processing events involving DmKu and DmBLM that, when eliminated by RNAi, lead to deletions. Finally, these results raise the possibility that, unlike the situation in mammals, where <e>BLM</e> appears to function exclusively in the homologous repair pathway, in Drosophila, DmBLM may be directly involved in, or at least influence the double-strand break recognition that leads to the NHEJ repair pathway.",M1

The causative gene for Bloom syndrome is BLM, which encodes the BLM RecQ helicase homolog protein. The first part of this review describes a long-term follow-up study of two Bloom syndrome siblings. Subsequently, the focus is placed on the functional domains of BLM. Laboratory diagnosis of Bloom syndrome by detecting mutations in BLM is laborious and impractical, unless there are common mutations in a population. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses for the detection of the BLM protein using a polyclonal BLM antibody, which are useful approaches for clinical diagnosis of Bloom syndrome, are also described. In addition, a useful adjunct for the diagnosis of Bloom syndrome in terms of the BLM function is investigated, since disease cells must have the defective BLM helicase function. This review also discusses the nuclear localization signal of BLM, the proteins that interact with BLM and tumors originating from Bloom syndrome.",M1
14729972,"Phosphorylation of the Bloom's syndrome helicase and its role in recovery from S-phase arrest.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a human genetic disorder associated with cancer predisposition. The BS gene product, <e>BLM</e>, is a member of the RecQ helicase family, which is required for the maintenance of genome stability in all organisms. In budding and fission yeasts, loss of RecQ helicase function confers sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA replication, such as hydroxyurea (HU), by failure to execute normal cell cycle progression following recovery from such an S-phase arrest. We have examined the role of the human BLM protein in recovery from S-phase arrest mediated by HU and have probed whether the stress-activated ATR kinase, which functions in checkpoint signaling during S-phase arrest, plays a role in the regulation of BLM function. We show that, consistent with a role for BLM in protection of human cells against the toxicity associated with arrest of DNA replication, BS cells are hypersensitive to HU. BLM physically associates with ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and rad3(+) related) protein and is phosphorylated on two residues in the N-terminal domain, Thr-99 and Thr-122, by this kinase. Moreover, BS cells ectopically expressing a BLM protein containing phosphorylation-resistant T99A/T122A substitutions fail to adequately recover from an HU-induced replication blockade, and the cells subsequently arrest at a caffeine-sensitive G(2)/M checkpoint. These abnormalities are not associated with a failure of the BLM-T99A/T122A protein to localize to replication foci or to colocalize either with ATR itself or with other proteins that are required for response to DNA damage, such as phosphorylated histone H2AX and RAD51. Our data indicate that RecQ helicases play a conserved role in recovery from perturbations in DNA replication and are consistent with a model in which RecQ helicases act to restore productive DNA replication following S-phase arrest and hence prevent subsequent genomic instability.",M1
14685245,"The Bloom's syndrome helicase suppresses crossing over during homologous recombination.Mutations in <e>BLM</e>, which encodes a RecQ helicase, give rise to Bloom's syndrome, a disorder associated with cancer predisposition and genomic instability. A defining feature of Bloom's syndrome is an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. These arise from crossing over of chromatid arms during homologous recombination, a ubiquitous process that exists to repair DNA double-stranded breaks and damaged replication forks. Whereas crossing over is required in meiosis, in mitotic cells it can be associated with detrimental loss of heterozygosity. BLM forms an evolutionarily conserved complex with human topoisomerase IIIalpha (hTOPO IIIalpha), which can break and rejoin DNA to alter its topology. Inactivation of homologues of either protein leads to hyper-recombination in unicellular organisms. Here, we show that BLM and hTOPO IIIalpha together effect the resolution of a recombination intermediate containing a double Holliday junction. The mechanism, which we term double-junction dissolution, is distinct from classical Holliday junction resolution and prevents exchange of flanking sequences. Loss of such an activity explains many of the cellular phenotypes of Bloom's syndrome. These results have wider implications for our understanding of the process of homologous recombination and the mechanisms that exist to prevent tumorigenesis.",M1
14647470,"Constitutive DNA damage is linked to DNA replication abnormalities in Bloom's syndrome cells.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with an elevated incidence of cancers. The gene mutated in BS, <e>BLM</e>, encodes a RecQ helicase family member. BS cells exhibit genomic instability, including excessive homologous recombination and chromosomal aberrations. We reported previously that BS cells also demonstrate increased error-prone nonhomologous endjoining, which could contribute to genomic instability in these cells. Here, we show that BS cells display an abnormality in the timing of replication of both early-replicating genes and late-replicating loci such as chromosomal fragile sites. This delayed replication is associated with a constitutively increased frequency of sites of DNA damage and repair, as determined by the presence of DNA repair factors such as RAD51 and Ku86. In addition, another RecQ family helicase, WRN, also localizes to these repair sites. The presence of these repair sites correlates with the temporal appearance of cyclin B1 expression, indicative of the cells having progressed beyond mid-S phase in the cell division cycle. Critically, these defects in BS cells are the direct result of loss of BLM function, because BS cells phenotypically 'reverted' following transfection with the BLM cDNA no longer show such defects. Thus, our data indicate that constitutive DNA damage is coupled to delayed DNA replication in BS cells.",M1

Further characterization reveals the Blm(tm3Brd) allele to be a hypomorph, producing a diminished quantity of normal mRNA and protein. The Blm(tm3Brd) allele produces sufficient normal protein to rescue Blm(tm1Ches) lethality. Evaluation of viable animals reveals an inverse correlation between the quantity of Blm protein and the level of chromosome instability and a similar genotypic relationship for tumor predisposition indicating that Blm protein is rate limiting for maintaining genomic stability and the avoidance of tumors.",M1
14599770,"Homologous recombination and cell cycle checkpoints: Rad51 in tumour progression and therapy resistance.We provide an overview of the functional interrelationship between genes and proteins related to DNA repair by homologous recombination and cell cycle regulation in relation to the progression and therapy resistance of human tumours. To ensure the high-fidelity transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, cells have evolved mechanisms to monitor genome integrity. Upon DNA damage, cells initiate complex response pathways including cell cycle arrest, activation of genes and gene products involved in DNA repair, and under some circumstances, the triggering of programmed cell death. Deregulation of this co-ordinated response leads to genetic instability and is fundamental to the aetiology of human cancer. Homologous recombination involved in DNA repair is induced by environmental damage as well as misreplication during the normal cell cycle. However, when not regulated properly, it can result in the loss of heterozygocity or genetic rearrangements, central to the process of carcinogenesis. The central step of homologous recombination is the DNA strand exchange reaction catalysed by the eukaryotic Rad51 protein. Here, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of how Rad51 is involved in the signalling and repair of DNA damage and how tumour suppressors, such as p53, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, <e>BLM</e> and FANCD2 are linked to Rad51-dependent pathways. An increased knowledge of the role of Rad51 in DNA repair by homologous recombination and its effects on cell cycle progression, tumour development and tumour resistance may provide opportunities for identifying improved diagnostic markers and developing more effective treatments for cancer.",M1
14577841,"Telomere and ribosomal DNA repeats are chromosomal targets of the bloom syndrome DNA helicase.BACKGROUND: Bloom syndrome is one of the most cancer-predisposing disorders and is characterized by genomic instability and a high frequency of sister chromatid exchange. The disorder is caused by loss of function of a 3' to 5' RecQ DNA helicase, <e>BLM</e>. The exact role of BLM in maintaining genomic integrity is not known but the helicase has been found to associate with several DNA repair complexes and some DNA replication foci. RESULTS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation of BLM complexes recovered telomere and ribosomal DNA repeats. The N-terminus of BLM, required for NB localization, is the same as the telomere association domain of BLM. The C-terminus is required for ribosomal DNA localization. BLM localizes primarily to the non-transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA repeat where replication forks initiate. Bloom syndrome cells expressing the deletion alleles lacking the ribosomal DNA and telomere association domains have altered cell cycle populations with increased S or G2/M cells relative to normal. CONCLUSION: These results identify telomere and ribosomal DNA repeated sequence elements as chromosomal targets for the BLM DNA helicase during the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. BLM is localized in nuclear bodies when it associates with telomeric repeats in both telomerase positive and negative cells. The BLM DNA helicase participates in genomic stability at ribosomal DNA repeats and telomeres.",M1
14576316,"Possible anti-recombinogenic role of Bloom's syndrome helicase in double-strand break processing.Bloom's syndrome (BS) which associates genetic instability and predisposition to cancer is caused by mutations in the <e>BLM</e> gene encoding a RecQ family 3'-5' DNA helicase. It has been proposed that the generation of genetic instability in BS cells could result from an aberrant non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ), one of the two main DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways in mammalian cells, the second major pathway being homologous recombination (HR). Using cell extracts, we report first that Ku70/80 and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), key factors of the end-joining machinery, and BLM are located in close proximity on DNA and that BLM binds to DNA only in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, BLM is phosphorylated and dissociates from DNA in a strictly DNA-PKcs-dependent manner. We also show that BS cells display, in vivo, an accurate joining of DSBs, reflecting thus a functional NHEJ pathway. In sharp contrast, a 5-fold increase of the HR-mediated DNA DSB repair in BS cells was observed. These results support a model in which NHEJ activation mediates BLM dissociation from DNA, whereas, under conditions where HR is favored, e.g. at the replication fork, BLM exhibits an anti-recombinogenic role.",M1
14517203,"Bloom syndrome cells undergo p53-dependent apoptosis and delayed assembly of BRCA1 and NBS1 repair complexes at stalled replication forks.Bloom syndrome (BS) is a hereditary disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation, genomic instability, and cancer. <e>BLM</e>, the gene defective in BS, encodes a DNA helicase thought to participate in genomic maintenance. We show that BS human fibroblasts undergo extensive apoptosis after DNA damage specifically when DNA replication forks are stalled. Damage during S, but not G1, caused BLM to rapidly form foci with gammaH2AX at replication forks that develop DNA breaks. These BLM foci recruited BRCA1 and NBS1. Damaged BS cells formed BRCA1/NBS1 foci with markedly delayed kinetics. Helicase-defective BLM showed dominant-negative activity with respect to apoptosis, but not BRCA1/NBS1 recruitment, suggesting catalytic and structural roles for BLM. Strikingly, inactivation of p53 prevented the death of damaged BS cells and delayed recruitment of BRCA1/NBS1. These findings suggest that BLM is an early responder to damaged replication forks. Moreover, p53 eliminates cells that rapidly assemble BRCA1/NBS1 without BLM, suggesting that BLM is essential for timely BRCA1/NBS1 function.",M1
12974384,"The Bloom's syndrome helicase interacts directly with the human DNA mismatch repair protein hMSH6.Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by genome instability and cancer susceptibility. <e>BLM</e>, the BS gene product, belongs to the highly-conserved RecQ family of DNA helicases. Although the exact function of BLM in human cells remains to be defined, it seems likely that BLM eliminates some form of homologous recombination (HR) intermediate that arises during DNA replication. Similarly, the mismatch repair (MMR) system also plays a crucial role in the maintenance of genomic stability, by correcting DNA errors generated during DNA replication. Recent evidence implicates components of the MMR system also in HR repair. We now show that hMSH6, a component of the heterodimeric mismatch recognition complex hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutS(alpha)), interacts with the BLM protein both in vivo and in vitro. In agreement with these findings, BLM and hMSH6 co-localise to discrete nuclear foci following exposure of the cells to ionising radiation. However, the purified recombinant MutS(alpha) complex does not affect the helicase activity of BLM in vitro. As BLM has previously been shown to interact with the hMLH1 component of the hMLH1/hPMS2 (hMutL(alpha)) heterodimeric MMR complex, our present findings further strengthen the link between BLM and processes involving correction of DNA mismatches, such as in the regulation of the fidelity of homologous recombination events.",M1

All polypeptides encoded by RECQL genes share a central region of seven helicase domains. The function of RECQL4 remains unknown, but based on the domain homology it possesses ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity such as BLM and WRN. Rothmund-Thomson, Bloom and Werner syndromes have overlapping clinical features, of which high predisposition to malignancies is the most remarkable feature. Here we report a fourth syndrome resulting in mutations in the RECQL genes. RAPADILINO syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short stature, radial ray defects and other malformations, as well as infantile diarrhoea, but not by a significant cancer risk. Four mutations in the RECQL4 gene were found in the Finnish patients, the most common mutation representing exon 7 in-frame deletion saving the helicase domain and showing dominant effect over other three nonsense mutations. The tissue expression of Recql4 in mouse well agrees with the tissue symptoms of RAPADILINO.

Many lines of evidence suggest that BLM is involved either directly in DNA replication or in surveillance during DNA replication, but its specific roles remain unknown. Here we show that hBLM can suppress both the temperature-sensitive growth defect and the DNA damage sensitivity of the yeast DNA replication mutant dna2-1. The dna2-1 mutant is defective in a helicase-nuclease that is required either to coordinate with the crucial Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) FEN1 nuclease in Okazaki fragment maturation or to compensate for scFEN1 when its activity is impaired. We show that human BLM interacts with both scDna2 and scFEN1 by using coimmunoprecipitation from yeast extracts, suggesting that human BLM participates in the same steps of DNA replication or repair as scFEN1 and scDna2.",M1
12724401,"A multiprotein nuclear complex connects Fanconi anemia and Bloom syndrome.Bloom syndrome (BS) is a genetic disorder associated with dwarfism, immunodeficiency, reduced fertility, and an elevated risk of cancer. To investigate the mechanism of this disease, we isolated from human HeLa extracts three complexes containing the helicase defective in BS, <e>BLM</e>. Interestingly, one of the complexes, termed BRAFT, also contains five of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group proteins (FA proteins). FA resembles BS in genomic instability and cancer predisposition, but most of its gene products have no known biochemical activity, and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood. BRAFT displays a DNA-unwinding activity, which requires the presence of BLM because complexes isolated from BLM-deficient cells lack such an activity. The complex also contains topoisomerase IIIalpha and replication protein A, proteins that are known to interact with BLM and could facilitate unwinding of DNA. We show that BLM complexes isolated from an FA cell line have a lower molecular mass. Our study provides the first biochemical characterization of a multiprotein FA complex and suggests a connection between the BLM and FA pathways of genomic maintenance. The findings that FA proteins are part of a DNA-unwinding complex imply that FA proteins may participate in DNA repair.",M1

In contrast to the homozygous mutations of Bloom syndrome, heterozygous carriers of BLM mutations may be at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. We have screened 2,333 Jewish individuals, including 497 individuals with colorectal cancer, 125 with adenomatous polyps, 767 with noncolorectal cancers and 944 controls for the truncating BLM(Ash) founder mutation. The BLM(Ash) mutation was carried by 0.80% of individuals with colorectal neoplasia, 0.87% of those with any type of cancer and 0.85% of controls.

12638184,"[Functional analysis of yeast homologue gene associated with human DNA helicase causative syndromes]Proteins having DNA helicase activity play very important roles in many processes involving DNA workings such as replication, repair, and recombination. In this decade, many DNA helicase genes have been cloned as the causative genes of human recessive heredity diseases. These are the causative genes for Xeroderma pigmentosum (XPB and XPD), Cockayne syndrome (CSB), diffuse collagen disease (Ku80), alpha-thalassmia (ATR-X), Bloom syndrome (<e>BLM</e>), Werner syndrome (WRN) and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS). The yeast homologue genes of these human DNA helicase genes exist. S. cerevisiae RAD25/SSL2, RAD3, RAD26, YKU80/HDF2 and RAD54 are the homologue for XPB/ERCC3, XPD/ERCC2, CSB/ERCC6, Ku80/XRCC5 and ATR-X/HX2, respectively. E coli. recQ gene and S. cerevisiae SGS1 are the homologue for all BLM, WRN and RTS. A search of whole genome of S. cerevisiae revealed that SGS1 is the sole homologue of recQ in S. cerevisiae. Thus it seems likely that SGS1 is a functional homologue of one or several human RecQ family genes. Many basic or essential functions are well conserved in the cells from lower eukaryotic to higher mammalian. The functional analysis in yeast could make an useful insight for the human homologue. To clarify the functions of S. cerevisiae Sgs1 and to get an insight into the functions of Blm, Wrn and Rts, in this study, we analyzed the phenotype of sgs1 disruptant and in detail the cause of the poor sporulation phenotype of sgs1 disruptants in relation to meiotic processes including meiotic recombination. The poor sporulation of sgs1 disruptants was complemented with a mutated SGS1 gene encoding a protein lacking DNA helicase activity; however, the mutated gene could suppress neither the sensitivity of sgs1 disruptants to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydroxyurea nor the mitotic hyperrecombination phenotype of sgs1 disruptants. The N-terminal 1-45 amino acid region and 698-1195 amino acid region of Sgs1, which including helicase domain and C-terminal RecQ conserved region with helicase activity, were required for complementation of MMS sensitivity and suppression of hyperrecombination of sgs1 disruptants in mitotic growth. The 126-400 and 596-1195 amino acid regions of Sgs1 were required for complementation of poor sporulation and of reduced meiotic functions. These regions required for the mitotic or meiotic functions of Sgs1 were well overlapped with the interaction regions of Top3 and Top2. Some of these results might explain the mechanism of the symptom of RecQ-related syndromes.",M1
12606585,"<e>BLM</e> helicase-dependent transport of p53 to sites of stalled DNA replication forks modulates homologous recombination.Diverse functions, including DNA replication, recombination and repair, occur during S phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. It has been proposed that p53 and BLM help regulate these functions. We show that p53 and BLM accumulated after hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, and physically associated and co-localized with each other and with RAD51 at sites of stalled DNA replication forks. HU-induced relocalization of BLM to RAD51 foci was p53 independent. However, BLM was required for efficient localization of either wild-type or mutated (Ser15Ala) p53 to these foci and for physical association of p53 with RAD51. Loss of BLM and p53 function synergistically enhanced homologous recombination frequency, indicating that they mediated the process by complementary pathways. Loss of p53 further enhanced the rate of spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in Bloom syndrome (BS) cells, but not in their BLM-corrected counterpart, indicating that involvement of p53 in regulating spontaneous SCE is BLM dependent. These results indicate that p53 and BLM functionally interact during resolution of stalled DNA replication forks and provide insight into the mechanism of genomic fidelity maintenance by these nuclear proteins.",M1

We find that endogenous BLM protein co-localizes with telomeric foci in ALT human cells but not telomerase positive immortal cell lines or primary cells. BLM interacts in vivo with the telomeric protein TRF2 in ALT cells, as detected by FRET and co-immunoprecipitation. Transient over-expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-BLM results in marked, ALT cell-specific increases in telomeric DNA. The association of BLM with telomeres and its effect on telomere DNA synthesis require a functional helicase domain.

Here, we report that the Bloom's syndrome protein (BLM) is cleaved in response to hydroxyurea (HU)- or UVC-induced apoptosis. The appearance and solubility of BLM proteolytic products differed according to whether proteolysis occurred in response to HU or UVC. One BS cell line homozygous for a null mutation in BLM was resistant to both UVC- and HU-induced apoptosis, while another one expressing a mutated BLM protein was resistant to HU-induced apoptosis but displayed normal sensitivity to UVC. Thus, UVC and HU appear to induce apoptosis through distinct pathways.",M1
12427531,"Recombinational DNA repair and human disease.We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the <e>BLM</e> helicase, which seems to play a role in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby promoting chromosome stability. The Werner syndrome gene (WRN) helicase, another member of the RecQ family like BLM, has very recently been found to help mediate homologous recombination. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically complex chromosomal instability disorder involving seven or more genes, one of which is BRCA2. FA may be at least partially caused by the aberrant production of reactive oxidative species. The breast cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are strongly implicated in HRR; BRCA2 associates with Rad51 and appears to regulate its activity. We discuss in detail the phenotypes of the various mutant cell lines and the signaling pathways mediated by the ATM kinase. ATM's phosphorylation targets can be grouped into oxidative stress-mediated transcriptional changes, cell cycle checkpoints, and recombinational repair. We present the DNA damage response pathways by using the DSB as the prototype lesion, whose incorrect repair can initiate and augment karyotypic abnormalities.",M1

The causative gene for BS is the BLM gene which encodes the BLM RecQ helicase protein. The BLM gene has 4437 bp and encodes 1417 amino acids. The detection of BLM gene mutations for laboratory diagnosis of BS is laborious and impractical, unless there are common mutations in a population. Here we describe the immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses for the detection of the BLM protein using a polyclonal BLM antibody. The BLM gene and protein were consistently and clearly detected in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed or phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphoblasts from control and various human hematopoietic cell lines. In a 7-week old human fetal brain, the BLM gene expression was strongly detected in contrast to an adult human brain. The BLM protein was not detected in EBV-transformed lymphoblasts from three BS patients. By immunohistochemistry, nuclear dots of the BLM protein were detected in both EBV-transformed lymphoblasts and PHA-stimulated lymphoblasts from the control. However, in lymphoblasts from BS patients no nuclear dots of the BLM protein were detected. These results indicate that the combinational analysis of immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry is a useful approach to screening of BS, although a mutation analysis is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of BS.",M1
12034743,"Functional link between <e>BLM</e> defective in Bloom's syndrome and the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein, ATM.Chromosome aberrations, genomic instability, and cancer predisposition are hallmarks of a number of syndromes in which the defective genes recognize and/or repair DNA damage or are involved in some aspect of DNA processing. We report here direct interaction between BLM, mutated in Bloom's Syndrome (BS), and ATM, mutated is ataxia-telangiectasia, and we have mapped the sites of interaction. Full-length BLM cDNA corrected sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and radiosensitivity in BS cells. Mitotic phosphorylation of BLM was partially dependent on ATM, and phosphorylation sites on BLM were identified. A phosphospecific antibody against one of these sites (Thr-99) revealed radiation-induced phosphorylation, which was defective in ataxia-telangiectasia cells. Stable cell lines expressing phosphorylation site mutants failed to correct radiosensitivity in BS cells but corrected SCE. These mutants also sensitized normal control cells to radiation and increased radiation-induced chromosome aberrations but did not cause SCE numbers to increase. These data suggest that ATM and BLM function together in recognizing abnormal DNA structures by direct interaction and that these phosphorylation sites in BLM are important for radiosensitivity status but not for SCE frequency.",M1
12019152,"The <e>BLM</e> helicase is necessary for normal DNA double-strand break repair.Experiments with the supF20 mutagenesis system demonstrate that extracts from Bloom's syndrome (BS) cells are unable to use microhomology elements within the supF20 gene to restore supF function after the induction of a double-strand break (DSB). Additional experiments with the pUC18 mutagenesis system demonstrate that although the efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair by BS extracts are comparable with those of normal extracts when ligatable ends are present, a significant 5-fold increase in mutation rate with BS extracts is observed when terminal phosphates are removed from the DNA substrate that needs repair. Mutant plasmids recovered after DSB repair by BS extracts contain smaller deletions within the lacZalpha gene not commonly recovered from normal extracts. This work demonstrates that BS cells, lacking the BLM helicase, process DSBs differently than normal cells and strongly suggests a role for the BLM helicase in aligning microhomology elements during recombinational events in DSB repair.",M1

11971187,"Increased error-prone non homologous DNA end-joining--a proposed mechanism of chromosomal instability in Bloom's syndrome.BS is an inherited cancer predisposition disorder caused by inactivation of the RecQ family helicase, <e>BLM</e>. One of the defining features of cells from BS individuals is chromosomal instability, characterized by elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), as well as chromosomal breaks, deletions, and rearrangements. Although the basis for chromosomal instability is poorly understood, there is evidence that chromosomal abnormalities can arise through an alteration in the efficiency or fidelity of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Here, we show that BS cells demonstrate aberrant DSB repair mediated by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA repair, one of the two main pathways for the repair of DSBs in mammalian cells. Through a comparison of BS cell lines, and a derivative in which the BS phenotype has been reverted by expression of the BLM cDNA, we show that BS cells display aberrant end-joining of DSBs. Importantly, DNA end-joining in BS cells is highly error-prone and frequently results in DNA ligation at distant sites of microhomology, creating large DNA deletions. This aberrant repair is dependent upon the presence of the Ku70/86 heterodimer, a key component in the NHEJ pathway. We propose that aberrant NHEJ is a candidate mechanism for the generation of chromosomal instability in BS.",M1

BS patients are predisposed to developing all the cancers that affect the general population, and BS cells exhibit marked genetic instability. We showed recently that BLM protein contributes to the cellular response to ionizing radiation by acting as downstream ATM kinase effector. We now show that following UVC treatment, BLM-deficient cells exhibit a reduction in the number of replicative cells, a partial escape from the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, and have an altered p21 response. Surprisingly, we found that hydroxyurea-treated BLM-deficient cells exhibit an intact S phase arrest, proper recovery from the S phase arrest, and intact p53 and p21 responses. We also show that the level of BLM falls sharply in response to UVC radiation. This UVC-induced reduction in BLM does not require a functional ATM gene and does not result from a subcellular compartment change. Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to UVC and hydroxyurea treatment both induce BLM phosphorylation via an ATM-independent pathway. These results are discussed in the light of their potential physiological significance with regard to the role of BLM in the cellular pathways activated by UVC radiation or HU-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis.",M1
11876000,"Bloom syndrome and Fanconi's anemia: rate and ethnic origin of mutation carriers in Israel.BACKGROUND: The Bloom syndrome gene, <e>BLM</e>, was mapped to 15q26.1 and its product was found to encode a RecQ DNA helicase. The Fanconi's anemia complementation group C gene was mapped to chromosome 9q22.3, but its product function is not sufficiently clear. Both are recessive disorders associated with an elevated predisposition to cancer due to genomic instability. A single predominant mutation of each disorder was reported in Ashkenazi Jews: 2281delATCTGAinsTAGATTC for Bloom syndrome (BLM-ASH) and IVS4 + 4AT for Fanconi's anemia complementation group C. OBJECTIVES: To provide additional verification of the mutation rate of BLM and FACC in unselected Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi populations analyzed at the Sheba Medical Center, and to trace the origin of each mutation. METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction to identify mutations of the relevant genomic fragments, restriction analysis and gel electrophoresis. We then applied the Pronto kit to verify the results in 244 samples and there was an excellent match. RESULTS: A heterozygote frequency of 1:111 for BLM-ASH and 1:92 for FACC was detected in more than 4,000 participants, none of whom reported a family history of the disorders. The Pronto kit confirmed all heterozygotes. Neither of the mutations was detected in 950 anonymous non-Ashkenazi Jews. The distribution pattern of parental origin differed significantly between the two carrier groups, as well as between each one and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: These findings as well as the absence of the mutations in non-Ashkenazi Jews suggest that: a) the mutations originated in the Israelite population that was exiled from Palestine by the Roman Empire in 70 AD and settled in Europe (Ashkenazi), in contrast to those who remained; and b) the difference in origin distribution of the BS and FACC mutations can be explained by either a secondary migration of a subgroup with a subsequent genetic drift, or a separate geographic region of introduction for each mutation.",M1
11840341,"Werner and Bloom helicases are involved in DNA repair in a complementary fashion.Werner syndrome (WS) is a recessive disorder characterized by premature senescence. Bloom syndrome (BS) is a recessive disorder characterized by short stature and immunodeficiency. A common characteristic of both syndromes is genomic instability leading to tumorigenesis. WRN and <e>BLM</e> genes causing WS and BS, encode proteins that are closely related to the RecQ helicase. We produced WRN-/-, BLM-/- and WRN(-/-)/BLM(-/-) mutants in the chicken B-cell line DT40. WRN-/- cells showed hypersensitivities to genotoxic agents, such as 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, camptothecin and methyl methanesulfonate. They also showed a threefold increase in targeted integration rate of exogenous DNAs, but not in sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency. BLM-/- cells showed hypersensitivities to the genotoxic agents as well as ultraviolet (UV) light, in addition to a 10-fold increase in targeted integration rate and an 11-fold increase in SCE frequency. In WRN(-/-)/BLM(-/-) cells, synergistically increased hypersensitivities to the genotoxic agents were observed whereas both SCE frequencies and targeted integration rates were partially diminished compared to the single mutants. Chromosomal aberrations were also synergistically increased in WRN(-/-)/BLM(-/-) cells when irradiated with UV light in late S to G(2) phases. These results suggest that both WRN and BLM may be involved in DNA repair in a complementary fashion.",M1

It is characterized by predisposition to cancer, immunodeficiency, high sensitivity to UV and genomic instability of somatic cells. Here we show physical and functional cooperation between BLM and p53 proteins. Ectopic expression of BLM causes anti-proliferative effect in p53 wild type, but not in p53-deficient cells; p53-mediated transactivation is attenuated in primary fibroblasts from Bloom syndrome patients. BLM and p53 proteins physically interact in the cells as demonstrated in yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems; interaction sites are mapped to 237-272 aa residues of BML and 285-340 aa of p53. Ectopic expression of the fragment of wild type BML containing p53-interactive domain suppresses p53-mediated transcription and interferes with p53-mediated growth inhibition. These observations indicate that BLM might be an important component of p53 function and suggest that Bloom Syndrome phenotype may in part be the result of the deregulation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway.",M1

We recently showed that BLM is phosphorylated and excluded from the nuclear matrix during mitosis. We now show that the phosphorylated mitotic BLM protein is associated with a 3'-5' DNA helicase activity and interacts with topoisomerase III alpha. We demonstrate that in mitosis-arrested cells, ionizing radiation and roscovitine treatment both result in the reversion of BLM phosphorylation, suggesting that BLM could be dephosphorylated through the inhibition of cdc2 kinase. This was supported further by our data showing that cdc2 kinase activity is inhibited in gamma-irradiated mitotic cells. Finally we show that after ionizing radiation, BLM is not involved in the establishment of the mitotic DNA damage checkpoint but is subjected to a subcellular compartment change. These findings lead us to propose that BLM may be phosphorylated during mitosis, probably through the cdc2 pathway, to form a pool of rapidly available active protein. Inhibition of cdc2 kinase after ionizing radiation would lead to BLM dephosphorylation and possibly to BLM recruitment to some specific sites for repair.",M1
11735402,"Inhibition of the Bloom's and Werner's syndrome helicases by G-quadruplex interacting ligands.G-Quadruplex DNAs are folded, non-Watson-Crick structures that can form within guanine-rich DNA sequences such as telomeric repeats. Previous studies have identified a series of trisubstituted acridine derivatives that are potent and selective ligands for G-quadruplex DNA. These ligands have been shown previously to inhibit the activity of telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase that regulates telomere length. The RecQ family of DNA helicases, which includes the Bloom's (<e>BLM</e>) and Werner's (WRN) syndrome gene products, are apparently unique among cellular helicases in their ability to efficiently disrupt G-quadruplex DNA. This property may be relevant to telomere maintenance, since it is known that the sole budding yeast RecQ helicase, Sgs1p, is required for a telomerase-independent telomere lengthening pathway reminiscent of the  ALT  pathway in human cells. Here, we show that trisubstituted acridine ligands are potent inhibitors of the helicase activity of the BLM and WRN proteins on both G-quadruplex and B-form DNA substrates. Inhibition of helicase activity is associated with both a reduction in the level of binding of the helicase to G-quadruplex DNA and a reduction in the degree to which the G-quadruplex DNA can support DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We discuss these results in the context of the possible utility of trisubstituted acridines as antitumor agents for the disruption of both telomerase-dependent and telomerase-independent telomere maintenance.",M1
11701636,"DNA helicases, genomic instability, and human genetic disease.DNA helicases are a highly conserved group of enzymes that unwind DNA. They function in all processes in which access to single-stranded DNA is required, including DNA replication, DNA repair and recombination, and transcription of RNA. Defects in helicases functioning in one or more of these processes can result in characteristic human genetic disorders in which genomic instability and predisposition to cancer are common features. So far, different helicase genes have been found mutated in six such disorders. Mutations in XPB and XPD can result in xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, or trichothiodystrophy. Mutations in the RecQ-like genes <e>BLM</e>, WRN, and RECQL4 can result in Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. Because XPB and XPD function in both nucleotide excision repair and transcription initiation, the cellular phenotypes associated with a deficiency of each one of them include failure to repair mutagenic DNA lesions and defects in the recovery of RNA transcription after UV irradiation. The functions of the RecQ-like genes are unknown; however, a growing body of evidence points to a function in restarting DNA replication after the replication fork has become stalled. The genomic instability associated with mutations in the RecQ-like genes includes spontaneous chromosome instability and elevated mutation rates. Mouse models for nearly all of these entities have been developed, and these should help explain the widely different clinical features that are associated with helicase mutations.",M1

To better understand the inflammatory responses that precede and concur with collagen deposition, we used three models of pulmonary fibrosis and identify a critical mechanistic role for IL-17A. After exposure to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), but not Schistosoma mansoni eggs, IL-17A produced by CD4(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells induced significant neutrophilia and pulmonary fibrosis. Studies conducted with C57BL/6 il17a(-/-) mice confirmed an essential role for IL-17A. Mechanistically, using ifngamma(-/-), il10(-/-), il10(-/-)il12p40(-/-), and il10(-/-)il17a(-/-) mice and TGF-beta blockade, we demonstrate that IL-17A-driven fibrosis is suppressed by IL-10 and facilitated by IFN-gamma and IL-12/23p40. BLM-induced IL-17A production was also TGF-beta dependent, and recombinant IL-17A-mediated fibrosis required TGF-beta, suggesting cooperative roles for IL-17A and TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis. Finally, we show that fibrosis induced by IL-1beta, which mimics BLM-induced fibrosis, is also highly dependent on IL-17A. IL-17A and IL-1beta were also increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with IPF. Together, these studies identify a critical role for IL-17A in fibrosis, illustrating the potential utility of targeting IL-17A in the treatment of drug and inflammation-induced fibrosis.",M2

METHODS: BMDMSCs were transferred 4 days after BLM inhalation. Wet/dry ratio, bronchoalveolar lavage cell profiles, histologic changes and deposition of collagen were analyzed. RESULTS: Nitrite, nitrate and cytokines were measured weekly through day 28. At day 7, the wet/dry ratio, neutrophilic inflammation, and amount of collagen were elevated in BLM-treated rats compared to sham rats (p = 0.05-0.002). Levels nitrite, nitrate, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and VEGF were also higher at day 7 (p &lt; 0.05). Degree of lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration increased steadily over time. BMDMSC transfer significantly reduced the BLM-induced increase in wet/dry ratio, degree of neutrophilic infiltration, collagen deposition, and levels of the cytokines, nitrite, and nitrate to those in sham-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05). Fluorescence in situ hybridization localized the engrafted cells to areas of lung injury.

In fact, the deglycosylation of BLM reduce the toxicity of this molecule and fails to produce reactive oxygen species, responsible for pulmonary fibrosis, and for anti-neoplastic activity of BLM. This causes toxic DNA lesions and ultimately leads to cell death. The therapeutic use of BLM is limited by a dose-dependent lung toxicity that eventually leads to fibrosis. Testing BLM-derivative molecules and defining their molecular mechanisms involved in tumor cell death may help to design new therapeutic approach with limited toxicity profile while maintaining anti-tumoral properties.

Here we report (i) the engineering of the DeltatlmH mutant SB8005 strain that produces the two TLM analogs, TLM H-1 and TLM H-2, (ii) production, isolation, and structural elucidation of TLM H-1 and TLM H-2 by NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses as the desired des-talose TLM analogs, and (iii) comparison of the DNA cleavage activities of TLM H-1 with selected TLMs and BLMs. These findings support the previous functional assignment of tlmH to encode an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase and unveil the TlmH-catalyzed hydroxylation at both C-41 and C-42 and the TlmK-catalyzed glycosylation of a labile carbinolamide intermediate as the final two steps for TLM biosynthesis. TlmH is apparently distinct from other enzymes known to catalyze carbinolamide formation. The availability of TLM H-1 now sets the stage to study the TlmH enzymology in vitro and to elucidate the exact contribution of the l-talose to the anticancer activities of TLMs in vivo.",M2
20067618,"Comparison of clastogen-induced gene expression profiles in wild-type and DNA repair-deficient Rad54/Rad54B cells.BACKGROUND: Previously we found that Rad54/Rad54B cells are more sensitive towards mitomycin C (MMC) as compared to wild-type (WT) cells. This difference in sensitivity was absent upon exposure to other clastogens like bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) and gamma-radiation. In order to get further insight into possible underlying mechanisms, gene expression changes in WT and Rad54/Rad54B MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) after exposure to the clastogens MMC and BLM were investigated. Exposures of these cells to mutagens (N-ac-AAF and ENU) and vehicle were taken as controls. RESULTS: Most exposures resulted in an induction of DNA damage signaling and apoptosis genes and a reduced expression of cell division genes in cells of both genotypes. As expected, responses to N-ac-AAF were very similar in both genotypes. ENU exposure did not lead to significant gene expression changes in cells of both genotypes, presumably due to its short half-life. Gene expression responses to clastogens, however, showed a genotype-dependent effect for BLM and MMC. MMC treated Rad54/Rad54B MEFs showed no induction of p53-signaling, DNA damage response and apoptosis as seen for all the other treatments. CONCLUSION: These data support our finding that different types of clastogens exist and that responses to these types depend on the DNA repair status of the cells.",M2
19959748,"3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (SB216763), a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor, displays therapeutic properties in a mouse model of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 modulates the production of inflammatory cytokines. Because bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) causes lung injury, which is characterized by an inflammatory response followed by a fibrotic degeneration, we postulated that blocking GSK-3 activity with a specific inhibitor could affect the inflammatory and profibrotic cytokine network generated in the BLM-induced process of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, here we investigated the effects of the GSK-3 inhibitor 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (SB216763) on a BLM-induced lung fibrosis model in mice. SB216763 prevented lung inflammation and the subsequent fibrosis when coadministered with BLM. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis of mice treated with BLM plus SB216763 revealed a significant reduction in BLM-induced alveolitis. Furthermore, SB216763 treatment was associated with a significantly lower production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. BLM-treated mice that received SB216763 developed alveolar epithelial cell damage and pulmonary fibrosis to a significantly lower extent compared with BLM-treated controls. These findings suggest that GSK-3 inhibition has a protective effect on lung fibrosis induced by BLM and candidate GSK-3 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19807783,"Spontaneous and bleomycin-induced chromosome damage in non cancer thyroid patients.BACKGROUND: Presence of chromosome damage in lymphocytes of patients affected by several diseases, including cancer, was detected by the micronucleus (MN) assay. Individual susceptibility to DNA damage, considered as a risk factor for cancer, can be also evaluated using the bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) sensitivity test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to evaluate spontaneous or BLM-induced MN frequencies in autoimmune (AI, n = 19) and non autoimmune (NAI, n = 11) thyroid patients, not receiving (131)I radiometabolic therapy with respect to a control group of 18 healthy subjects. According to thyroid function, patients were also divided into hypothyroid (n = 10), euthyroid (n = 13) or hyperthyroid (n = 7) subjects. RESULTS: Spontaneous MN frequencies of AI and NAI patients did not differ from those of controls. Hypothyroid patients had more elevated MN basal levels (9.00 + or - 1.71 per thousand) than hyperthyroid (3.75 + or - 1.17 per thousand, P &lt; 0.05) and euthyroid (5.38 + or - 0.97 per thousand, P &lt; 0.01) patients or healthy subjects (4.17 + or - 0.63 per thousand, P &lt; 0.01). In particular, the hypothyroid AI group showed the highest value (9.79 + or - 2.26 per thousand, P &lt; 0.01). All thyroid patients responded differently to BLM than controls (39.90 + or - 2.48 per thousand vs. 31.08 + or - 2.51 per thousand, P = 0.0377). The NAI group had BLM-induced MN levels (45.00 + or - 2.56 per thousand) significantly higher (P = 0.0215) than AI patients (36.95 + or - 3.49 per thousand) or healthy subjects (31.08 + or - 2.51 per thousand). No significant difference was seen when patients were stratified according to autoimmunity. CONCLUSIONS: We report that hypothyroid patients exhibit a moderate increase in the level of spontaneous genome damage, and that AI thyroid patients resulted to be less sensitive than NAI patients to the mutagen sensitivity test. In prospective, it may be of interest to reinvestigate hypothyroid patients when correction of their dysfunction is achieved.",M2
19758434,"Protective effect of geranylgeranylacetone, an inducer of heat shock protein 70, against drug-induced lung injury/fibrosis in an animal model.BACKGROUND: To determine whether oral administration of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a nontoxic anti-ulcer drug that is an inducer of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, protects against drug-induced lung injury/fibrosis in vivo. METHODS: We used a bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung fibrosis model in which mice were treated with oral 600 mg/kg of GGA before and after BLM administration. Inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated by histological scoring, hydroxyproline content in the lung and inflammatory cell count, and quantification by ELISA of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL method. The induction of HSP70 in the lung was examined with western blot analysis and its localization was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of inflammation and fibrosis in the BLM-induced lung injury model and induction of HSP70 by oral administration of GGA. GGA prevented apoptosis of cellular constituents of lung tissue, such as epithelial cells, most likely related to the de novo induction of HSP70 in the lungs. GGA-treated mice also showed less fibrosis of the lungs, associated with the findings of suppression of both production of MIP-2 and inflammatory cell accumulation in the injured lung, compared with vehicle-treated mice. CONCLUSION: GGA had a protective effect on drug-induced lung injury/fibrosis. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate, which are indispensable for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, often cause interstitial lung diseases, an adverse event that currently cannot be prevented. Clinical use of GGA for drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis might be considered in the future.",M2
19758314,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha processing inhibitor-1 inhibits skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced murine model of scleroderma.Elevated serum concentration of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor p55 (sTNFRp55) is known to correlate with the severity of systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, it has not been verified whether this increase contributes to the pathogenesis of SSc. In this study, we found that sTNFRp55 also is increased in the bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced murine model of SSc. Therefore, we examined the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha processing inhibitor-1 (TAPI-1), the inhibitor of TNFRp55 sheddase, in this model. TAPI-1 was administered weekly to mice with skin fibrosis induced by daily BLM injections. TAPI-1 significantly suppressed BLM-induced skin thickness and the number of myofibroblasts. It also inhibited the increase of serum sTNFRp55 after 3 weeks of BLM injections. The mRNA expression of collagen type I alpha1, transforming growth factor-beta1 and alpha smooth muscle actin were decreased by TAPI-1 administration. Taken together, these findings indicate that targeting the TNFalpha converting enzyme might be a new type of therapy for patients with SSc.",M2
19672658,"Effects of IS-741, a synthetic anti-inflammatory agent, on bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung injury consists of excessive inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. IS-741 has been reported to be an anti-inflammatory drug through an inhibitory action on cell adhesion. In this study we investigated whether IS-741 could inhibit the progression of pulmonary fibrosis through inflammatory cell infiltration. Lung injury was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by intratracheal instillation of BLM. IS-741 was administered daily intraperitoneally. The hydroxyproline content and fluid content in the lung on Day 28 were significantly lower in the IS-741-treated mice. The histological degree of lung injury or fibrosis was reduced in IS-741-treated mice. Administration of IS-741 caused significant reduction in the absolute number of total cells, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLTs) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on Day 7. Furthermore, the hydroxyproline content was significantly lower in IS-741-treated mice even though IS-741 was started on Day 14 after BLM instillation. Treatment with IS-741 had an inhibitory effect on BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis via the repression of MCP-1 or cysLTs in this murine experimental model.",M2
19671337,"[Anti-type IV collagenase single-chain antibody ameliorates bleomycin-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis in mice]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of anti-type IV collagenase single-chain antibody scFv (3G11) on bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups (blank, saline control, BLM, low-dose treatment, intermediate-dose treatment, and high-dose treatment), the animal model of pulmonary fibrosis was induced with 400 ng/g intratracheal BLM. The day that treatment groups were injected with BLM was marked Day 0. Then at Days 1 - 7, scFv (3G11) was injected once intraperitoneally each day with three dosage [low-dose treatment (15 microg/g), intermediate-dose treatment (30 microg/g) and high-dose treatment (45 microg/g)]. At Day 21, 6 mice of each group (saline control, BLM, intermediate-dose treatment) were sacrificed and pathomorphological changes of left lungs evaluated with HE stained sections. Meanwhile, 6 mice of each group (blank, saline control, BLM, low-dose treatment, intermediate-dose treatment, and high-dose treatment) were sacrificed, the content of hydroxyproline was detected to measure the degree of collagen deposition. Macrophages were extracted from murine abdominal cavity and primarily cultured. And the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 excretion by different concentrations of scFv (3G11) (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 micromol/L) was determined by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: By image analysis, the degree of fibrosis in the lungs of treated group was lighter than that of the BLM group. The percentages of the area of interalveolar septum (45.3% +/- 3.2%) and the number of nucleated cells (451 +/- 47) of treated group were remarkably reduced as compared with the BLM group (59.0% +/- 3.0%, 599 +/- 42, both P &lt; 0.01). The content of hydroxyproline of the intermediate-dose treatment group [(0.82 +/- 0.05) microg/mg] and high-dose treatment group [(0.80 +/- 0.03) microg/mg] was lower than that of the BLM group [(0.92 +/- 0.07) microg/mg, P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01]. The result of gelatin zymography demonstrated that the excretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by macrophage was inhibited by scFv (3G11) at the concentration of 15 micromol/L. CONCLUSION: Single-chain antibody directed against type IV collagenase might inhibit the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19643175,"Inhibitory effects of citrus extracts on the experimental pulmonary fibrosis.AIM OF THE STUDY: A Chinese herbal formula, Hu-qi-yin possessed an anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect. Pericarp of Citrus reticulata, one of the herbal drugs contained in this formula showed the most potent inhibitory activity on the proliferation of human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELF). The present study was designed to clarify the active principles responsible for the activity and further explore the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The water, 75% ethanol and flavonoids-enriched extracts of Citrus reticulata were prepared and screened for their anti-proliferation activity using HELF culture system. The ethanol extract was further administered orally at doses of 100 and 200 mg/(kg day) to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced pulmonary fibrosis rats. The analyses of the rat body weight, hydroxyproline levels in serum and lung, scores of alveolitis and fibrosis, as well as the expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) at the protein and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in lung were performed. RESULTS: The ethanol extract showed the strongest inhibitory activity on HELF proliferation. Further research using BLM-induced rat model revealed that the ethanol extract at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/(kg day) caused a marked increase of body weight at first 7 days, significantly lowered the hydroxyproline levels in lung, greatly improved the pathologic scores, as well as inhibited the overexpressions of TGF-beta(1) protein and mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the ethanol extract of Citrus reticulata has anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects and might have a great potential for the treatment of fibrosis of lung.",M2
19604271,"Thalidomide has a therapeutic effect on interstitial lung fibrosis: evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies.The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of thalidomide (THD) on interstitial lung fibrosis (ILF). In vitro, human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL-F) to myofibroblast (MF) trans-differentiation was induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. The effects of THD on trans-differentiation process or differentiated MF were evaluated by measuring hydroxyproline (HYP) content by alkaline hydrolysis colorimetry, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein by Western blot and alpha-SMA and pro-collagen III mRNA expressions by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; in vivo, a mouse model of ILF was generated by daily subcutaneous injection of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) in female C3H mice. Gastric perfusion of THD began 1 week prior to injection and lasted for 8 weeks. Lung specimens were harvested at different time-points (1, 4, 6 and 8 weeks) for pathology and immunohistochemistry examination. The HYP content, alpha-SMA and pro-collagen III mRNA expressions were also assessed. THD inhibited the up-regulation of HYP protein, pro-collagen III mRNA and alpha-SMA protein induced by TGF-beta1 in HFL-F cells, and additionally inhibited pro-collagen III mRNA expression on trans-differentiated MF. THD reduced HYP synthesis in the lung tissues of BLM-treated mice at week 4, and slightly reduced the numbers of alpha-SMA-positive cells. THD had an effect on ILF models both in vitro and in vivo.",M2

METHODS: Twenty-five adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 equal groups: <e>BLM</e> group, undergoing intra-tracheal perfusion of BLM so as to establish animal models of alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis and then inhaling aerosolized normal saline (NS); NS group undergoing intra-tracheal perfusion of NS and then inhaling aerosolized NS; ASON 0 d group, undergoing intra-tracheal perfusion of BLM and then inhaling aerosolized STAT1 ASON 3 ml immediately; ASON 7 d group, undergoing intra-tracheal perfusion of BLM and then inhaling STAT1 ASON 3 ml 7 days later; and ASON 14 d group undergoing intra-tracheal perfusion of BLM and then inhaling aerosolized STAT1 ASON 3 ml 14 days later. Aerosolized inhalation was repeated once every other day for 4 times. Twenty-eight days after intra-tracheal perfusion the rats were sacrificed with their lungs taken out to undergo pathological examination. NS was infused into the right lungs to get bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). ELISA was used to examine the concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the BALF. RESULTS: The pathology result of the lung tissues showed that compared with the BLM and ASON 14 d groups, the alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis of the ASON 0 d group were obviously milder. The scores of alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis of the ASON 0 d group were (1.80 +/- 0.84) and (2.60 +/- 0.55) respectively, both significantly lower than those of the BLM group [(2.40 +/- 0.55) and (4.40 +/- 0.55) respectively] and those of the ASON 7 d group [(2.20 +/- 0.45) and (3.00 +/- 0.71) respectively] (all P &lt; 0.05). The scores of pulmonary fibrosis of the ASON 7 d group was significantly lower than those of the BLM and ASON 14 d groups (both P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of TGF-beta and TNF-alpha in BALF of the ASON 0 d group were (48.11 +/- 3.46) pg/ml and (1.93 +/- 0.14) ng/ml respectively, both significantly lower than those of the BLM group [(57.67 +/- 2.46) pg/ml and (2.45 +/- 0.25) ng/ml respectively, both P &lt; 0.05]. The concentration of TGF-beta in BALF of the ASON 0 d group was significantly lower than those of the ASON 7 d and ASON 14 d groups [(51.42 +/- 3.57) pg/ml and (55.8 3 +/- 1.79) pg/ml respectively, both P &lt; 0.05]. The concentration of TGF-beta in BALF of the ASON7 d group was significantly lower than those of the BLM and ASON 14 d groups (both P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: STAT1 ASON administered in the early stage helps depress the pulmonary fibrosis procedure, and the earlier the drug is administrated the better effect would be obtained. Aerosolized STAT1 ASON can be used as a therapeutic method for pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19573614,"Involvement of C-jun NH2-terminal kinase and apoptosis induced factor in apoptosis induced by deglycosylated bleomycin in laryngeal carcinoma cells.In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the deglycosylation of bleomycin-A2 (<e>BLM</e>-A2) does not affect the capacity of this drug to induce cell death by apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner in laryngeal cancer cells (HEp-2), but suppresses the ability of BLM-A2 to induce ROS formation. We have now investigated the consequence of BLM-A2 deglycosylation in terms of the involvement of apoptotic pathways in HEp-2 cells. Apoptosis induced by bleomycin-A2 and deglyco-BLM-A2 is associated with the release of cytochrome c and AIF. Only Bax was oligomerized with BLM-A2-induced HEp-2 cell death. BLM-A2 and deglyco-BLM-A2-induced apoptosis depended on JNK activation but was independent of death receptors expression. In contrast, both of these drugs would sensitize HEp-2 cells to death receptor ligand-induced cell death. These observations indicate that the deglycosylation of BLM does not impair the ability of the drug to trigger cell death through activation of the intrinsic pathway by the release of AIF responsible for mitochondrial permeability and chromatin condensation independent of caspases activation.",M2
19552800,"Blockade of advanced glycation end product formation attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats.BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been proposed to be involved in pulmonary fibrosis, but its role in this process has not been fully understood. To investigate the role of AGE formation in pulmonary fibrosis, we used a bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-stimulated rat model treated with aminoguanidine (AG), a crosslink inhibitor of AGE formation. METHODS: Rats were intratracheally instilled with BLM (5 mg/kg) and orally administered with AG (40, 80, 120 mg/kg) once daily for two weeks. AGEs level in lung tissue was determined by ELISA and pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated by Ashcroft score and hydroxyproline assay. The expression of heat shock protein 47 (HSP47), a collagen specific molecular chaperone, was measured with RT-PCR and Western blot. Moreover, TGFbeta1 and its downstream Smad proteins were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: AGEs level in rat lungs, as well as lung hydroxyproline content and Ashcroft score, was significantly enhanced by BLM stimulation, which was abrogated by AG treatment. BLM significantly increased the expression of HSP47 mRNA and protein in lung tissues, and AG treatment markedly decreased BLM-induced HSP47 expression in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, AG dose-dependently downregulated BLM-stimulated overexpressions of TGFbeta1, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2 and p-Smad3 protein in lung tissues. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest AGE formation may participate in the process of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and blockade of AGE formation by AG treatment attenuates BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats, which is implicated in inhibition of HSP47 expression and TGFbeta/Smads signaling.",M2
19549112,"Targeted drug delivery system for oral cancer therapy using sonoporation.Ultrasound-mediated destruction of microbubbles has been proposed as an innovative non-invasive drug delivery system for cancer therapy. We developed a specific drug delivery system for squamous cell carcinoma that uses sonoporation with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody. Administration of a low dose of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) by sonoporation with the anti-EGFR antibody produced a marked growth inhibition of Ca9-22 cells in vitro. In addition, scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed apparent surface deformation of Ca9-22 cells treated with sonoporation in the presence of the antibody. Interestingly, the population of apoptotic cells was remarkably increased when a low dose of BLM was delivered using sonoporation with the Fab fragment of the anti-EGFR antibody. These findings indicate that sonoporation with the Fab fragment makes it possible to administer drugs into cells more efficiently and specifically, suggesting a novel application for chemotherapy and gene therapy treatments for oral squamous cell carcinoma.",M2
19540250,"Effect of bleomycin on interstitial telomeric sequences of immortalized Chinese hamster ovary cells.The effect of the radiomimetic compound bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) on interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs) was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by using PNA-FISH with a pantelomeric probe. CHO cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of BLM and chromosomal aberrations were analyzed in the first mitosis after treatment. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that 18.1% and 9.5% of the total aberrations observed in cells exposed to BLM and harvested 18h and 3h after treatment, respectively, exhibited one or more FISH-detectable telomeric signals. Most of the chromosome breaks exhibiting telomeric signals observed in BLM-treated cells occurred in the centromeric regions of chromosomes. This observation, along with the finding of entirely labeled acentric fragments in BLM-exposed cells but not in untreated cells, shows that this antibiotic induces breakage at chromosomal sites containing ITSs. In addition, our results show that heterochromatic ITSs are involved more than expected in the formation of chromosome/chromatid breaks - and perhaps chromatid exchanges - induced by BLM, taking into account the percentage of the genome covered by telomeric sequences. On the contrary, our data strongly suggest that ITSs are not preferentially involved in the formation of dicentrics, multicentrics, centric rings, acentric fragments or chromatid deletions induced by BLM. Moreover, our results show that BLM is capable of inducing amplification and translocation of telomeric repeats, and suggest that this antibiotic produces breakage within centromeric ITSs, although chromosome regions containing these sequences are not the preferential target for BLM clastogenic action. On the other hand, our results show that BLM treatment increases the size of ITSs and that this effect is not related to the chromosomal sensitivity of the exposed cells to this compound.",M2
19537173,"[Direct site-specific cleavage of double-stranded DNA by conjugates of bleomycin A5 with triplex-forming oligonucleotide]Monofunctional conjugates of 15-mer triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) with covalently attached bleomycin A5 residue at the 5'-end (<e>Blm</e>-p15) were synthesized. Bifunctional conjugates of TFO containing, in addition to Blm, the residues of intercalator 6-chloro-2-methoxy-9-aminoacridine (Acr) or (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenazinium (Phn) were obtained for the first time. The Acr and Phn residues were attached to the 3'-phosphate group of TFO through L1 and L2 linkers, respectively, resulting in the compounds Blm-p15pL1-Acr and Blm-p15pL2-Phn. The values of dissociation constants of the corresponding triplexes were evaluated using the gel retardation method. The Acr residue in Blm-p15pL1-Acr was shown to enhance the stability of the formed triplex by one order of magnitude. It was demonstrated that all synthesized conjugates are capable of specifically and nonspecifically damaging a target DNA, forming direct breaks and alkaline-labile sites. The extent of the specific cleavage of the target DNA was 15% in the case of a fivefold excess of the conjugates over the DNA duplex. The site-specific triplex-mediated cleavage of a target DNA was shown for the first time to occur predominantly (&gt; 90%) with the formation of the direct breaks of both DNA strands. The results show the availability of bleomycin-containing oligonucleotides as antigene compounds.",M2
19506813,"Targeted delivery of bleomycin to the brain using photo-chemical internalization of Clostridium perfringens epsilon prototoxin.Cells infiltrating into normal brain from malignant brain tumors are protected by the blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents the delivery and limits the effects of anti-tumor agents. We have evaluated the ability of photochemical internalization (PCI) to limit the effects of an agent known to broadly open the BBB to a target region of the brain. The PCI-based relocation and activation of macromolecules into the cell cytosol has the advantage of minimal side effects since the effect is localized to the area exposed to light, allowing the access of chemotherapeutic agents only to these regions. Non tumor bearing inbred Fisher rats were treated with photosensitizer, and a nontoxic intraperitoneal dose of Clostridium perfringens epsilon prototoxin (ETXp) followed by light exposure. Post-contrast T(1) MRI scans were used to monitor the degree BBB disruption. F98 tumor cells were implanted into the brains of other animals that were subsequently treated 24 h later with ETXp-PCI BBB opening followed by the i.p. administration of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). PCI delivery of ETXp at low fluence levels demonstrated significant MRI enhancement. No effect on the BBB was observed if photosensitizer and light was given in the absence ETXp. The survival of animals implanted with F98 tumor cells was significantly extended following ETXp-PCI BBB opening and BLM therapy compared to controls. PCI delivered ETXp was effective in opening the BBB in a limited region of the brain. ETXp-PCI mediated BBB opening clearly increased the efficacy of BLM therapy.",M2
19498056,"Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor-10 during both inflammatory and fibrotic phases attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.RATIONALE: Fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10) controls survival, proliferation, and differentiation of distal-alveolar epithelial progenitor cells during lung development. OBJECTIVES: To test for the protective and regenerative effect of Fgf10 overexpression in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: In SP-C-rtTA; tet(O)Fgf10 double-transgenic mice, lung fibrosis was induced in 2-month-old transgenic mice by subcutaneous delivery of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), using an osmotic minipump for 1 week. Exogenous Fgf10 expression in the alveolar epithelium was induced for 7 days with doxycycline during the first, second, and third weeks after bleomycin pump implantation, and lungs were examined at 28 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fgf10 overexpression during Week 1 (inflammatory phase) resulted in increased survival and attenuated lung fibrosis score and collagen deposition. In these Fgf10-overexpressing mice, an increase in regulatory T cells and a reduction in both transforming growth factor-beta(1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids whereas the number of surfactant protein C (SP-C)-positive, alveolar epithelial type II cells (AEC2) was markedly elevated. Analysis of SP-C and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling) double-positive cells and isolation of AEC2 from lungs overexpressing Fgf10 demonstrated increased AEC2 survival. Expression of Fgf10 during Weeks 2 and 3 (fibrotic phase) showed significant attenuation of the lung fibrosis score and collagen deposition. CONCLUSIONS: In the bleomycin model of lung inflammation and fibrosis, Fgf10 overexpression during both the inflammatory and fibrotic phases results in a greatly reduced extent of lung fibrosis, suggesting that FGF10 may be useful as a novel approach to the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19468696,"The organic selenium compound selenomethionine modulates bleomycin-induced DNA damage and repair in human leukocytes.The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of selenomethionine (SeMet) on the induction, repair, and persistence of DNA damage in human leukocytes challenged with bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). Comet assay was used to determine DNA strand breaks and hOGG1 for the specific recognition of oxidative damage. Leukocytes were (A) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, (B) damaged with BLM, and (C) incubated to allow DNA repair. Comet assay was performed after each phase. SeMet (50 microM) was supplemented either during phase A, B, or C, or AB, or ABC. Treatment with SeMet decreased BLM-induced stand breaks when added during phase AB. Results obtained after the repair period indicate that SeMet favors repair of DNA damage especially when applied during phase AB. The comparison between DNA damage before and after repair showed that BLM-induced damage was repaired better in the presence of SeMet. Our results showed antigenotoxic effect of SeMet on BLM-induced DNA and also on repair and persistence of this damage when applied before and simultaneously with BLM.",M2
19440379,"Adenovirus dodecahedron, as a drug delivery vector.BACKGROUND: Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) is an anticancer antibiotic used in many cancer regimens. Its utility is limited by systemic toxicity and dose-dependent pneumonitis able to progress to lung fibrosis. The latter can affect up to nearly 50% of the total patient population, out of which 3% will die. We propose to improve BLM delivery by tethering it to an efficient delivery vector. Adenovirus (Ad) dodecahedron base (DB) is a particulate vector composed of 12 copies of a pentameric viral protein responsible for virus penetration. The vector efficiently penetrates the plasma membrane, is liberated in the cytoplasm and has a propensity to concentrate around the nucleus; up to 300000 particles can be observed in one cell in vitro. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Dodecahedron (Dd) structure is preserved at up to about 50 degrees C at pH 7-8 and during dialysis, freezing and drying in the speed-vac in the presence of 150 mM ammonium sulfate, as well as during lyophilization in the presence of cryoprotectants. The vector is also stable in human serum for 2 h at 37 degrees C. We prepared a Dd-BLM conjugate which upon penetration induced death of transformed cells. Similarly to free bleomycin, Dd-BLM caused dsDNA breaks. Significantly, effective cytotoxic concentration of BLM delivered with Dd was 100 times lower than that of free bleomycin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Stability studies show that Dds can be conveniently stored and transported, and can potentially be used for therapeutic purposes under various climates. Successful BLM delivery by Ad Dds demonstrates that the use of virus like particle (VLP) results in significantly improved drug bioavailability. These experiments open new vistas for delivery of non-permeant labile drugs.",M2
19436146,"Vitamin levels in lung tissue of rats with bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) is a chemotherapeutic agent against different carcinomas, one dose of which causes dependent pulmonary fibrosis. The present study was taken up in order to measure the retinyl ester, alpha-tocopherol and cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) level in lung tissue in the rats following BLM-induced fibrosis. Fourteen rats were randomly divided into two groups as a control and a BLM group. On the day of the experiment, the BLM group rats were instilled with BLM (7.5 mg/kg) and the control group with sterile saline intratracheally. Fourteen days after instillation, rats in each group were sacrificed and the lungs were prepared for histopathological examination and determination of the vitamin levels with a HPLC system. The levels of retinyl ester, alpha-tocopherol and vitamin D(3) in the lungs of the BLM group were determined to be lower than in the controls. There was statistically significant difference for the alpha-tocopherol and vitamin D(3) concentrations compared to the control group (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001), respectively. According to these results in pulmonary fibrosis, vitamins were consumed by the lung tissue and their levels decreased.",M2
19429264,"Bleomycin-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation in human bronchial epithelial cells involves the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta.Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a central role in the development of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) lung toxicity, but the regulatory mechanisms are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of BLM on cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) and first confirmed that BLM induced the transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB signaling in BECs. We also found that BLM activated Akt (protein kinase B, PKB) and increased the phosphorylation level of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). GSK3beta is known to be a key downstream target of Akt, and LY294002, the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt inhibitor, which promoted the dephosphorylation of GSK3beta, significantly attenuated BLM-induced NF-kappaB activation. Next, we further observed that constitutively active GSK3beta stabilized the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaBalpha), inhibited p65 nuclear translocation and partially blocked BLM-induced NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, a co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that GSK3beta formed a complex with IkappaBalpha, while GSK3beta phosphorylation caused by BLM led to their dissociation. These results suggest that BLM can induce the activation of NF-kappaB signaling in BECs and this process is tightly associated with the phosphorylation status of GSK3beta, implying a possible regulatory mechanism of NF-kappaB signaling in BECs during the toxic lung injury induced by BLM.",M2
19428379,"Inhibition of homologous recombination by treatment with BVDU (brivudin) or by RAD51 silencing increases chromosomal damage induced by bleomycin in mismatch repair-deficient tumour cells.Mismatch repair (MMR) has been shown to control homologous recombination (HR) by aborting strand exchange between divergent sequences. We previously demonstrated that MMR-deficient tumour cells are more resistant to chromosomal damage induced by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) during the G(2) phase, likely due to the lack of the MMR inhibitory effect on HR. Aim of this study was to investigate whether inhibition of HR by the nucleoside analogue BVDU [(E)-5(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, brivudin], or silencing of genes involved in HR function, might affect sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumour cells to DNA damage induced by BLM in G(2). The results indicated that BVDU increased chromatid damage and DNA double strand breaks induced by BLM only in MMR-deficient MT-1, HL-60R, HCT116 cells, which are more resistant to BLM with respect to MMR-proficient TK-6, HL-60S and HCT116/3-6 lines. Silencing of RAD51, a key component of HR, increased sensitivity of MMR-deficient HCT-15 cells to BLM clastogenicity; in this case combined treatment with BVDU had no additional effect. Similarly, treatment with BVDU did not affect BLM clastogenicity in CAPAN-1 cells, characterized by a defective HR due to BRCA2 mutations. Conversely, BVDU increased chromatid breaks induced by BLM in HCT-15 cells transiently silenced for DNA-PK catalytic subunit, which plays a key role in non-homologous end joining. The BVDU-mediated increase of chromatid breaks in MMR-deficient cells did not depend on its previously reported inhibitory effect on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In fact, it was observed also in cells stably silenced for PARP-1, which is responsible for most of cellular PARP activity. These data support the suggestion that the higher sensitivity of MMR-proficient versus MMR-deficient cells to BLM-induced chromatid breaks in the G(2) phase is a consequence of the inhibition of HR by MMR. In MMR-deficient cells, BVDU attenuates the repair of BLM-induced DSBs and this is likely to occur via inhibition of HR.",M2
19426591,"[Effect of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on inflammatory mediators, type I and type III collagen mRNA of rat pulmonary fibrosis]AIM: To investigate the effect of aerosolized signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASON) on the expression of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and typeI and typeIII collagen mRNA of the bleomycin-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: 45 adult female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal saline (NS) group, bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) group and ASON group. BLM group and ASON group were intratracheally instilled with bleomycin (BLM) while NS group was instilled with NS. NS group and BLM group were aerosolized with NS while ASON group was aerosolized with STAT1 ASON on day 0, 2, 4 and 6 after intratracheal administration. Then each group was divided into 3 subgroups and the rats were sacrificed on day 7, 14 and 28. The concentration of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB in BALF was detected. The lung tissues were removed and HE and Masson staining was performed to observe the extent of alveolitis and fibrosis. The mRNA levels of typeI and typeIII collagen in the lung tissues were measured. RESULTS: Compared with BLM group, the scores of alveolitis and fibrosis in ASON group were remarkably meliorated (P&lt;0.05). Compared with NS group, the concentration of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB in BALF in BLM group was significantly increased, but it was lower in ASON group than in BLMA group (P&lt;0.05). The concentration of IFN-gamma in BALF was lower in BLM group than in NS group (P&lt;0.05), but it was higher in ASON group than in BLM group (P&lt;0.05). The mRNA levels of typeI and typeIII collagen at various time points in ASON group were significantly lower than those in BLM group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The aerosolized STAT1 ASON has anti-fibrosis effect, which may result from the lessened production of typeI and typeIII collagen through reducing the concentration of cytokines in BALF such as TNF-alpha, PDGF-BB and TGF-beta1 and inhibiting the decline of IFN-gamma in BALF.",M2
19406902,"Enhancement of the recombinagenic and mutagenic activities of bleomycin in yeast by intercalation of acridine compounds into DNA.Strain D7 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to measure the induction by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) of mitotic recombination at the trp5 locus and point mutations at ilv1 in the presence and absence of acridine compounds. BLM is a potent mutagen and recombinagen in the D7 assay. The acridines vary, some being mutagenic or recombinagenic and others not. Combined treatments were used to distinguish whether a genetically inactive acridine has no effect on the genetic activity of BLM or modulates its action. When an acridine is itself genetically active, combined treatments were used to determine whether its effects are additive with those of BLM or whether there is interaction between the two compounds. Acridine compounds that share the ability to intercalate between the base pairs of DNA but differ in their mutagenic specificity owing to the presence of different substituent groups were analysed. Clear potentiation and synergistic interactions were detected in combined treatments with BLM and aminoacridines, nitroacridines or an acridine mustard. Potentiation and synergy were also observed in sequential exposures in which the yeast were grown in the presence of acridine compounds and then treated with BLM in the absence of free acridine. The results are consistent with an increase in BLM susceptibility conferred by acridine intercalation. It is likely that the intercalating agents increase the access of BLM to the minor groove of DNA, where it abstracts a hydrogen from the 4' position of deoxyribose, creating a free radical that is processed into strand breaks.",M2
19381349,"Vesnarinone represses the fibrotic changes in murine lung injury induced by bleomycin.We investigated the potential usefulness of vesnarinone, a novel cytokine inhibitor, for the treatment of lung fibrosis using a murine model of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Mice were fed a control diet (n=42), or a diet containing low (n=42) or high (n=42) dose of vesnarinone. Dietary intake of vesnarinone minimized the BLM toxicity as reflected by significant decreases in numbers of inflammatory cells, KC, and soluble TNF receptors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A quantitative evaluation of histology demonstrated significantly mild lung parenchymal lesions in BLM-treated mice fed with diet containing high dose of vesnarinone than in the control diet group. Consistent with the histopathology, hydroxyproline levels in lung tissue from BLM-treated mice fed with diet containing vesnarinone were significantly lower than that from mice fed with control diet. We concluded that vesnarinone inhibits BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, at least in part, by the inhibition of acute lung injuries in the early phase.",M2
19380784,"ATLa, an aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 synthetic analog, prevents the inflammatory and fibrotic effects of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.Despite an increase in the knowledge of mechanisms and mediators involved in pulmonary fibrosis, there are no successful therapeutics available. Lipoxins (LX) and their 15-epimers, aspirin-triggered LX (ATL), are endogenously produced eicosanoids with potent anti-inflammatory and proresolution effects. To date, few studies have been performed regarding their effect on pulmonary fibrosis. In the present study, using C57BL/6 mice, we report that bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung fibrosis was prevented by the concomitant treatment with an ATL synthetic analog, ATLa, which reduced inflammation and matrix deposition. ATLa inhibited BLM-induced leukocyte accumulation and alveolar collapse as evaluated by histology and morphometrical analysis. Moreover, Sirius red staining and lung hydroxyproline content showed an increased collagen deposition in mice receiving BLM alone that was decreased upon treatment with the analog. These effects resulted in benefits to pulmonary mechanics, as ATLa brought to normal levels both lung resistance and compliance. Furthermore, the analog improved mouse survival, suggesting an important role for the LX pathway in the control of disease establishment and progression. One possible mechanism by which ATLa restrained fibrosis was suggested by the finding that BLM-induced myofibroblast accumulation/differentiation in the lung parenchyma was also reduced by both simultaneous and posttreatment with the analog (alpha-actin immunohistochemistry). Interestingly, ATLa posttreatment (4 days after BLM) showed similar inhibitory effects on inflammation and matrix deposition, besides the TGF-beta level reduction in the lung, reinforcing an antifibrotic effect. In conclusion, our findings show that LX and ATL can be considered as promising therapeutic approaches to lung fibrotic diseases.",M2
19254480,"The effects of aerosolized STAT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on rat pulmonary fibrosis.Previous study showed that aerosolized signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASON) inhibited the expression of STAT1 and ICAM-1 mRNA and protein in alveolar macrophages (AMs) and decreased the concentrations of TGF-beta, PDGF and TNF-alpha in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. Administration of STAT1 ASON ameliorated alveolitis in rat pulmonary fibrosis. However, further investigations are needed to determine whether there is an effect from administration of STAT1 ASON on fibrosis. This study investigated the effect of aerosolized STAT1 ASON on the expressions of inflammatory mediators, hydroxyproline and type I and type III collagen mRNA in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. The results showed that STAT1 ASON applied by aerosolization could ameliorate alveolitis and fibrosis, inhibit the expressions of inflammatory mediators, decrease the content of hydroxyproline, and suppress the expressions of type I and type III collagen mRNA in lung tissue in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that aerosolized STAT1 ASON might be considered as a promising new strategy in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19250543,"Down-regulation of the inhibitor of growth family member 4 (ING4) in different forms of pulmonary fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has underscored the role of hypoxia and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of idiopathic fibrotic lung disease. Inhibitor of growth family member 4 (ING4) has recently attracted much attention as a tumor suppressor gene, due to its ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of ING4 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis both in the bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-model and in two different types of human pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). METHODS: Experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by a single tail vein injection of bleomycin in 6- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6mice. Tissue microarrays coupled with qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were applied in whole lung samples and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 30 patients with IPF, 20 with COP and 20 control subjects. RESULTS: A gradual decline of ING4 expression in both mRNA and protein levels was reported in the BLM-model. ING4 was also found down-regulated in IPF patients compared to COP and control subjects. Immunolocalization analyses revealed increased expression in areas of normal epithelium and in alveolar epithelium surrounding Masson bodies, in COP lung, whereas showed no expression within areas of active fibrosis within IPF and COP lung. In addition, ING4 expression levels were negatively correlated with pulmonary function parameters in IPF patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a potential role for ING4 in lung fibrogenesis. ING4 down-regulation may facilitate aberrant vascular remodelling and fibroblast proliferation and migration leading to progressive disease.",M2
19222034,"Structure-affinity relationship study of bleomycins and Shble protein by use of a chemical array.The photocrosslinked chemical array format is useful not merely for screening protein ligands, but also for gaining insight into structure-affinity relationships (SARs). By probing an array of 2000 natural products, containing 50 bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) derivatives, with cell lysates that overexpress RFP-fused Shble protein, we successfully observed interactions between Shble protein and BLMs on the array. Among the BLM derivatives, those that had long C-terminal tails were found to bind strongly. The binding signal intensities observed on the chemical array correlated well with the association constants, which were determined by isothermal titration carolimetry (ITC) experiments (r(2)=0.663), showing that the on-chip results were not an artifact of ligand immobilization. In addition to the C-terminal tails, the propionamide moieties in pyrimidoblamic acid (PBA) also appeared to be important for binding. The contributions of the propionamide moieties of PBA to binding were further supported by the X-ray structure of the complex of Shble protein and BLM A(6). These results provide insight into the structural requirements for recognition of BLMs by Shble protein.",M2
19218193,"Uric acid is a danger signal activating NALP3 inflammasome in lung injury inflammation and fibrosis.RATIONALE: Lung injury leads to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis through myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) signaling pathway. The molecular mechanisms by which lung injury triggers IL-1beta production, inflammation, and fibrosis remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To determine if lung injury depends on the NALP3 inflammasome and if bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung injury triggers local production of uric acid, thereby activating the NALP3 inflammasome in the lung. Methods: Inflammation upon BLM administration was evaluated in vivo in inflammasome-deficient mice. Pulmonary uric acid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis were analyzed in mice treated with the inhibitor of uric acid synthesis or with uricase, which degrades uric acid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung injury depends on the NALP3 inflammasome, which is triggered by uric acid locally produced in the lung upon BLM-induced DNA damage and degradation. Reduction of uric acid levels using the inhibitor of uric acid synthesis allopurinol or uricase leads to a decrease in BLM-induced IL-1beta production, lung inflammation, repair, and fibrosis. Local administration of exogenous uric acid crystals recapitulates lung inflammation and repair, which depend on the NALP3 inflammasome, MyD88, and IL-1R1 pathways and Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 for optimal inflammation but are independent of the IL-18 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Uric acid released from injured cells constitutes a major endogenous danger signal that activates the NALP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1beta production. Reducing uric acid tissue levels represents a novel therapeutic approach to control IL-1beta production and chronic inflammatory lung pathology.",M2
19204734,"Injection of bleomycin in newborn mice induces autoimmune sialitis that is transferred by CD4 T cells.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) induces cellular apoptosis or necrosis by producing reactive oxygen species, and has been used to induce scleroderma in adult mice. We wondered whether BLM induces the same pathological phenotype in newborn mice as in adult mice. BLM was subcutaneously administrated to newborn BALB/c mice. At 1 month of age, BLM-treated mice showed severe destruction of salivary glands with enlargement of nearby lymph nodes. These nodes contained CD4(+) T cells and B220(+)cells with high expression of MHC class II molecules. In addition, autoantibodies were detected by HEp-2 staining and western blotting. The cell transfer experiments were performed to evaluate the role of autoimmune phenomena in these pathological changes. Following the transfer of enriched CD4(+) T cells to 1-month-old BALB/c nude mice, the salivary glands were severely damaged with CD4(+) T cell and B220(+) cells infiltrations. The number of T-cell antigen receptor Vbeta 8.3(+) CD4(+) T cells was significantly increased in BLM-treated murine spleen. These findings will provide new insights into the causal factors of environment in autoimmunity and the relationship between autoreactive CD4(+) T cells and autoantibodies.",M2
19180474,"alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone suppresses bleomycin-induced collagen synthesis and reduces tissue fibrosis in a mouse model of scleroderma: melanocortin peptides as a novel treatment strategy for scleroderma?OBJECTIVE: Recently, we found that human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) express melanocortin 1 receptors (MC-1R) that bind alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In search of novel therapies for scleroderma (systemic sclerosis [SSc]), we used the bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) model to investigate the effects of alpha-MSH on collagen synthesis and fibrosis. METHODS: Collagen expression in HDFs was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. Signal transduction studies included pharmacologic blockade, immunofluorescence analysis, Western blotting, and reporter-promoter assays. Oxidative stress was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and anti-oxidative enzyme levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. The effect of alpha-MSH in the BLM mouse model of scleroderma was assessed by histologic, immunohistochemical, real-time RT-PCR, and protein analyses. Expression of MC-1R and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in skin and HDF samples from patients with SSc was determined by RT-PCR and compared with that in samples from normal controls. RESULTS: Treatment with alpha-MSH (and related peptides) suppressed BLM-induced expression of type I and type III collagen in HDFs, and this effect was cAMP-dependent. Neither BLM nor alpha-MSH altered Smad signaling, but antioxidants inhibited BLM-induced collagen expression in vitro. In addition, alpha-MSH suppressed BLM-induced oxidative stress and enhanced the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). In the BLM mouse model, alpha-MSH reduced skin fibrosis and collagen content and increased tissue levels of SOD2 and HO-1. In skin and HDFs from patients with SSc, both MC-1R and POMC messenger RNAs were detected, but there were no differences compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and related peptides that exert their effects via MC-1R may provide a novel antifibrogenic therapeutic tool for the treatment of fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma.",M2
19158840,"Induction of autoimmunity in a bleomycin-induced murine model of experimental systemic sclerosis: an important role for CD4+ T cells.Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the excessive deposition of collagen in the skin or other organs and the production of specific antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Recently, bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced experimental scleroderma was reported in a murine model. Here, we present further development of this model and suggest that it is appropriate for the analysis of human diffuse type SSc. BLM was injected into the shaved backs of C3H or BALB/c mice (100 microg/mouse) 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Skin fibrosis was confirmed and pathological changes were seen in the lower part of the esophagus and stomach similar to those seen in SSc. The sera from these mice had autoantibodies specific to the damaged tissues and ANAs. Transfer of CD4(+) T cells from BLM-treated BALB/c mice induced the same pathological changes and antibody production in untreated-BALB/c nude mice. Hence, tissue fibrosis and the production of ANAs are probably associated with CD4(+) T-cell activity in this model. In conclusion, this model will be valuable for investigating the relationship between tissue fibrosis and abnormalities of the immune system.",M2
19156149,"A randomised trial of intrapericardial bleomycin for malignant pericardial effusion with lung cancer (JCOG9811).Safety and efficacy of intrapericardial (i.p.c.) instillation of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) following pericardial drainage in patients with malignant pericardial effusion (MPE) remain unclear. Patients with pathologically documented lung cancer, who had undergone pericardial drainage for MPE within 72 h of enrolment, were randomised to either arm A (observation alone after drainage) or arm B (i.p.c. BLM at 15 mg, followed by additional i.p.c. BLM 10 mg every 48 h). The drainage tube was removed when daily drainage was 20 ml or less. The primary end point was survival with MPE control (effusion failure-free survival, EFFS) at 2 months. Eighty patients were enrolled, and 79 were eligible. Effusion failure-free survival at 2 months was 29% in arm A and 46% in arm B (one-sided P=0.086 by Fisher's exact test). Arm B tended to favour EFFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.40-1.03, one-sided P=0.030 by log-rank test). No significant differences in the acute toxicities or complications were observed. The median survival was 79 days and 119 days in arm A and arm B, respectively. This medium-sized trial failed to show statistical significance in the primary end point. Although ipc BLM appeared safe and effective in the management of MPE, the therapeutic advantage seems modest.",M2
19146404,"Identification and cleavage site analysis of DNA sequences bound strongly by bleomycin.A hairpin DNA library containing an 8-base pair sequence-randomized region was employed in a SELEX-type procedure to identify DNAs that bound strongly to bleomycin A(5), the latter of which was immobilized on a solid support. Ten hairpin DNAs that bound <e>BLM</e> A(5) strongly were identified and sequenced, and used to characterize DNA binding by the antitumor antibiotic. While all 10 selected hairpin DNAs bound to BLM strongly, they did exhibit a range of binding specificities. Further, while the binding specificity was generally the greatest for hairpin DNAs that contained at least one of the sequences (5'-GC-3' and 5'-GT-3') cleaved most frequently by Fe(II).bleomycin, the hairpin DNA exhibiting the poorest binding specificity also contained a 5'-GT-3' site. Four of the hairpin DNA substrates were 5'-(32)P end-labeled and used to assess the preferred sites of cleavage by Fe(II).BLM. The substrate DNAs included two lacking any 5'-GT-3' or 5'-GC-3' site; these were cleaved at 5'-AA-3' and (more strongly) at 5'-AT-3' and 5'-GA-3' sequences. For two hairpin DNAs containing 5'-GT-3' or 5'-GC-3' sequences, cleavage was observed at these sequences as well, but the three aforementioned sequences were also cleaved efficiently. For hairpin DNA 3, which was bound the least well of the 10 DNAs studied, a 5'-TA-3' site was also cleaved efficiently. Thus, the pattern and intensities of cleavage of the four DNAs studied were not entirely consistent with the preferred pattern of DNA cleavage reported for Fe(II).BLM in numerous published studies that have employed arbitrarily chosen DNA substrates. Also studied were the chemistry of DNA cleavage for one of the hairpin DNAs, and competition experiments in which the diminution of cleavage was measured following admixture of a molar excess of a smaller hairpin DNA shown to be an exceptionally good substrate for cleavage by Fe(II).BLM. In the aggregate, the data indicate that the relationship between DNA binding and degradation by Fe.BLM, as well as the chemistry leading to DNA degradation, are more complex than suggested by earlier studies that employed only DNA degradation product analysis as an end point.",M2
19139057,"A direct view by immunofluorescent comet assay (IFCA) of DNA damage induced by nicking and cutting enzymes, ionizing (137)Cs radiation, UV-A laser microbeam irradiation and the radiomimetic drug bleomycin.In DNA repair research, DNA damage is induced by different agents, depending on the technical facilities of the investigating researchers. A quantitative comparison of different investigations is therefore often difficult. By using a modified variant of the neutral comet assay, where the histone H1 is detected by immunofluorescence [immunofluorescent comet assay (IFCA)], we achieve previously unprecedented resolution in the detection of fragmented chromatin and show that trillions of ultraviolet A photons (of a few eV), billions of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) molecules and thousands of gamma quanta (of 662 keV) generate, in first order, similar damage in the chromatin of HeLa cells. A somewhat more detailed inspection shows that the damage caused by 20 Gy ionizing radiation and by a single laser pulse of 10 microJ are comparable, while the damage caused by 12 microg/ml BLM depends highly on the individual cell. Taken together, this work provides a detailed view of DNA fragmentation induced by different treatments and allows comparing them to some extent, especially with respect to the neutral comet assay.",M2
19109203,"Targeting TLR2 attenuates pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by reversion of suppressive immune microenvironment.Pulmonary fibrosis is a consequence of chronic lung injury and is associated with a high mortality. Despite the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis remaining as an enigma, immune responses play a critical role in the deregulation of wound healing process after lung injury, which leads to fibrosis. Accumulating evidence argues the rationales for current treatments of pulmonary fibrosis using immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids. In this study, we report that bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), a well-known fibrogenic agent functioning as a TLR2 agonist, induced the maturation of dendritic cells and release of cytokines. The BLM activation of TLR2 mediated a time-dependent alteration of immune responses in the lung. These responses resulted in an increase in the tissue-infiltrating proinflammatory cells and cytokines in the early period initially following BLM exposure and an increase in the tissue-infiltrating suppressive immune cells and factors during the later period following BLM exposure. TLR2 deficiency, however, reduced pulmonary inflammation, injury, and subsequently attenuated pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting TLR2 by a TLR2-neutralizing Ab not only markedly decreased animal death but also protected animals from the development of pulmonary fibrosis and reversed the established pulmonary fibrosis through regulating BLM-induced immunosuppressive microenvironments. Our studies suggest that TLR2 is a promising target for the development of therapeutic agents against pulmonary fibrosis and that eliminating immunosuppressive cells and factors via immunostimulants is a novel strategy for fibro-proliferative diseases. Moreover, combining BLM with an anti-TLR2 Ab or TLR2 antagonist for cancer therapy will improve the BLM therapeutic profile by enhancing anti-cancer efficacy and reducing systemic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
19083398,"Lycopene from tomatoes partially alleviates the bleomycin-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis in rats.In this study, lycopene extracted from tomatoes was evaluated to treat PF induced by <e>BLM</e> in rats. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of 20 rats each for a normal control group (group C), BLM-treated group (group M), and lycopene + BLM-treated group (group L). The rats in groups M and L were subjected to intratracheal instillation of BLM to induce PF; group C served as a sham control (intratracheal instillation of normal saline). Lycopene diluted with olive oil was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight once a day in group L after BLM instillation, and groups C and M were treated with the same amounts of olive oil. The pathologic alterations of lung tissues, the concentrations of TNF-alpha, NO, malonyldialdehyde, the activities of superoxide dismutase in plasma, and the expression of TNF-alpha in lungs were assessed on day 3, 7, 14, and 28 after BLM instillation. The results showed that the lung coefficients in group L were reduced (day 14, P &lt; .01) as well as the extents of alveolitis (day 7 and 14, P &lt; .05) and PF (day 14 and 28, P &lt; .05) compared with group M. The concentrations of TNF-alpha (day 7, 14, and 28, P &lt; .001), NO (day 14, P &lt; .05), and malonyldialdehyde (day 3, P &lt; .01) in plasma as well as the expression of TNF-alpha in lungs decreased, whereas the plasma superoxide dismutase activities increased (day 28, P &lt; .05) in group L compared with group M. Our study demonstrates that lycopene can partially reduce the extent of PF induced by BLM in rats. These findings suggest that the suppression of oxidative stress, the reduction of plasma TNF-alpha and NO levels, and the down-regulation of TNF-alpha in lungs contribute to the alleviation of PF in rats administered lycopene.",M2

However, only 23 and 22 ORFs showed striking similarities to the biosynthetic gene clusters for the bleomycins (<e>BLMs</e>) and tallysomycins (TLMs), respectively; the remaining ORFs do not show significant homology to ORFs from the related BLM and TLM clusters. The ZBM gene cluster consists of 16 nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding eight complete NRPS modules, three incomplete didomain NRPS modules, and eight freestanding single NRPS domains or associated enzymes, a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene encoding one PKS module, six sugar biosynthesis genes, as well as genes encoding other biosynthesis and resistance proteins. A genetic system using Escherichia coli-Streptomyces flavoviridis intergeneric conjugation was developed to enable ZBM gene cluster boundary determinations and biosynthetic pathway manipulations.",M2
19076314,"Photochemical internalization of bleomycin is superior to photodynamic therapy due to the therapeutic effect in the tumor periphery.Photochemical internalization (PCI) is under development for clinical use in treatment of soft tissue sarcomas and other solid tumors. PCI may release endocytosed bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) into the cytosol by photochemical rupture of the endocytic vesicles. In this study, the human fibrosarcoma xenograft HT1080 was transplanted into the leg muscle of athymic mice. The photosensitizer disulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (AlPcS(2a)) and BLM were systemically administrated 48 h and 30 min, respectively, prior to light exposure at 670 nm (30 J cm(-2)). The purposes of this study were to evaluate the treatment response to AlPcS(2a)-photodynamic therapy (PDT) and AlPcS(2a)-PDT in combination with BLM (i.e. PCI of BLM) in an orthotopic, invasive and clinically relevant tumor model and to explore the underlying response mechanisms caused by PDT and PCI of BLM. The treatment response was evaluated by measuring tumor growth, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), histology and fluorescence microscopy. The results show that PCI of BLM is superior to PDT in inducing tumor growth retardation and acts synergistically as compared to the individual treatment modalities. The CE-MRI analyses 2 h after AlPcS(2a)-PDT and PCI of BLM identified a treatment-induced nonperfused central zone of the tumor and a well-perfused peripheral zone. While there were no differences in the vascular response between PDT and PCI, the histological analyses showed that PDT caused necrosis in the tumor center and viable tumor cells were found in the tumor periphery. PCI caused larger necrotic areas and the regrowth in the peripheral zone was almost completely inhibited after PCI. The results indicate that PDT is less efficient in the tumor periphery than in the tumor center and that the treatment effect of PCI is superior to PDT in the tumor periphery.",M2
19035292,"Increased glutathione level is not involved in enhanced bleomycin sensitivity in cisplatin-resistant 2780CP cells.The cytotoxic activity of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) was evaluated in cisplatin (CDDP)-sensitive (A2780) and -resistant (2780CP) human ovarian cancer cells, and the mechanism of increased antitumor activity of BLM in the 2780CP cells was investigated. Compared with the A2780 cells, the 2780CP cells exhibited a 4.5-fold increase in resistance to CDDP, but were 4.0-fold more sensitive to BLM. The cellular glutathione (GSH) levels in the 2780CP cells were significantly higher than those in the A2780 cells, however, GSH depletion in the 2780CP cells below the levels in the A2780 cells by using buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) did not affect the sensitivity to BLM. BLM decreased 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation after 24-h exposure by 27.5%-90% compared to that of the untreated control at BLM doses of 25-500 ng/ml in the 2780CP cells, but only by 1.5% -45.8% in the A2780 cells. Furthermore, in the 2780CP cells, the percentage of S-phase cells markedly decreased, with an increase in G2/M-phase cells as determined by flow cytometry after exposure to BLM. The enhanced cytotoxity of BLM in CDDP-resistant 2780CP cells could be attributed to BLM-induced G2/M accumulation and significantly inhibited DNA synthesis, not to increased cellular GSH levels.",M2
19007869,"DNA-repair-deficient Rad54/Rad54B mice are more sensitive to clastogens than wild-type mice.The sensitivity of DNA-repair-deficient Rad54/Rad54B mice for clastogens was studied and compared to that of wild-type mice. LacZ mutant frequencies (MF) in Rad54/Rad54B mice, after treatment with mitomycin C (MMC), bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) and gamma-irradiation, were compared to those of the wild-type mice following the same treatments. While none of the clastogens showed an induction of the lacZ MF in the wild-type mice, there was a significant increase of the lacZ MF in the bone marrow of the Rad54/Rad54B mice after treatment with BLM and gamma-irradiation and in the spleen after MMC treatment. As expected, the positive control ENU showed a significant increase in the lacZ MF in all tested organs in wild-type mice. Mutant colonies were hybridized with total mouse DNA in order to discriminate between small gene mutations and large DNA rearrangements and translocations (size-change mutations). The hybridization studies showed a significant increase in mouse DNA positive clones 4 days after treatment with MMC and BLM in the bone marrow of the wild-type mice, which is indicative for chromosomal rearrangements and translocations to occur. An even more pronounced increase was seen 28 days after treatment with the same compounds in the Rad54/Rad54B mice.",M2
18974632,"Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand, suppresses bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligands have been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory actions. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is defined as a specific form of chronic fibrosing lung disease characterized by progressive fibrosis which leads to deterioration and destruction of the lungs. Objective: To investigate whether the PPARgamma ligand pioglitazone (PGZ) inhibited bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced acute lung injury and subsequent fibrosis. METHODS: BLM was administered intratracheally to Wistar rats which were then treated with PGZ. Rat alveolar macrophages were stimulated with BLM for 6 h with or without PGZ pretreatment for 18 h. MRC-5 cells (human lung fibroblasts) were treated with PGZ for 18 h. After the treatment, the cells were stimulated with transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-beta) for 6 h. RESULTS: PGZ inhibited BLM-induced acute lung injury and subsequent lung fibrosis when it was administered from day -7. PGZ treatment suppressed the accumulation of inflammatory cells in lungs and the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on day 3. PGZ also inhibited BLM-induced TNF-alpha production in alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, PGZ inhibited fibrotic changes and an increase in hydroxyproline content in lungs after instillation of BLM, even when PGZ was administered in the period from day 7 to day 28. Northern blot analyses revealed that PGZ inhibited TGF-beta-induced procollagen I and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression in MRC-5 cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that activation of PPARgamma ameliorates BLM-induced acute inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes at least partly through suppression of TNF-alpha, procollagen I and CTGF expression. Beneficial effects of this PPARgamma ligand on inflammatory and fibrotic processes open new perspectives for a potential role of PPARgamma as a molecular target in fibroproliferative lung diseases.",M2
18844077,"[Mutagen sensitivity in peripheral blood lymphocytes among coke-oven workers]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitivity to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) among coke-oven workers. METHODS: Ninty-four coke-oven workers with exposure to a high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 64 non-coke-oven workers (control) were recruited into this study. PBL was challenged by 8 microg/ml BLM, a known carcinogen, to induce certain amount of DNA damage, the difference of olive tail moment (TM) measured by comet assay before and after BLM treatment reflected the sensitivity towards mutagens. RESULTS: The distribution of age, sex, and prevalence of smoking and drinking were not significantly different between these two groups. The geometric mean of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) was significantly higher in coke-oven workers than in controls (9.0 versus 1.5 microg/L, t = -9.317, P &lt; 0.01). The coke-oven workers showed significantly higher sensitivity to BLM than controls (17.7 versus 14.9, t = -2.583, P = 0.01). A large inter-group difference in sensitivity to BLM was observed in both controls and coke-oven workers. Stratification analysis revealed the significant association between high 1-OHP level (&gt; 9.0 microg/L) and increased sensitivity to BLM (F = 4.001, P = 0.05) among coke-oven workers. Smoking subjects showed a significant higher value of sensitivity than nonsmokers in controls but not in coke-oven workers. No significant difference was observed between age, drinking status, coking history or external exposure class and BLM sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Exposure to coke oven emission could increase the sensitivity to mutagens, which might be a reason of high incidence of lung cancer among coke-oven workers.",M2

METHOD: One hundred and forty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 6 groups (24 rats in each group, model group, sham group, prednisone group (0.56 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), curcumin with low dose 5 mg group, curcumin with middle dose group 10 mg and curcumin with high dose group 20 mg per 100 g of body weight). Rats in all groups except in sham group were injected with BLM intratracheally. Curcumin with different doses were given by gavage one time everyday for 7, 14 and 28 days. Prednisone were given to rats in prednisone group, po, serving as the positive treatment group. On the 7th, 14th, 28th day, the lung functions (inspiratory resistance, maximal volutary ventilation, forced vital capacity, Fev 0.2/FVC, peak expiratory flow) were determinated in experimental rats, respectively, and the concentrations of hydroxyproline in lung homogenates of each rat were assayed. RESULT: Administration of curcumin in different doses improved lung functions of BLM-induced fibrotic rats in the all experimental days; and it decreased the concentration of hydroxyproline in lung homogenates compared with those levels in model control group; and it also lessened the hyperplasia of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. CONCLUSION: Administration of curcumin can suppress BLM induced pulmonary fibrosis indicated by improved respiratory function, as well as companied with low content of hydroxyproline in lung tissue of rats.",M2
18832650,"Suplatast tosilate prevents bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.Increasing evidence suggests that the development of pulmonary fibrosis is a T helper (Th) 2-mediated process. Suplatast tosilate is a Th2 cytokine inhibitor that is widely used as an asthma controller in Japan. Therefore, we hypothesized that suplatast tosilate might have an inhibitory effect on the development of pulmonary fibrosis. To investigate this effect, suplatast tosilate was administered to mice after the intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). The effect of suplatast tosilate was studied by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and a hydroxyproline assay. We found that the treatment of mice with suplatast tosilate significantly reduced the degree of pulmonary fibrosis. Because a significantly elevated Th2 response was not detected in the C57BL/6 mice after BLM administration, the effect of suplatast tosilate on Th2 cytokines could not be demonstrated. Interestingly, however, the up-regulation of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 levels in the BAL fluid was found to be suppressed. Following these results, we also demonstrated that suplatast tosilate effectively inhibited the production of MCP-1 in alveolar macrophages (AMs). These findings suggest that suplatast tosilate has both anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, which were associated with a suppressed MCP-1 expression in AMs. Thus, suplatast tosilate, which is already widely used in Japan, may warrant further consideration as a potentially useful treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
18785980,"Inhibitory effect of emodin on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.1. Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment for pulmonary fibrosis. Emodin, a component in Chinese herbs, has been shown to have an antifibrotic effect on pancreatic fibrosis and liver fibrosis. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that emodin may attenuate the development of pulmonary fibrosis. 2. Mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 16 in each). One group was a control group; the remaining four groups were treated with intratracheal instillation of 3 mg/kg bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). The following day, emodin (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg per day, p.o.) treatment was started for three of the BLM-treated groups and was continued for 21 days. The fourth BLM-treated group (and the control group) received daily 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (placebo) by gavage over the same period. 3. Bleomycin challenge provoked severe pulmonary fibrosis, with marked increases in fibrosis fraction, hydroxyproline content and myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue. Emodin treatment (10 and 20 mg/kg per day, p.o.) attenuated all these biochemical indices, as well as histopathological alterations induced by BLM. Furthermore, in mice injected with BLM, elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta1, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These increases were significantly inhibited by 10 and 20 mg/kg per day emodin. 4. In cell culture, exposure of cells to 6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 micromol/L emodin for 24 h decreased fibroblast proliferation. Treatment of cells with the same concentrations of emodin for 72 h decreased collagen production by fibroblasts. In addition, emodin (6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 micromol/L) inhibited the steady state expression of alpha1 (I) procollagen and alpha2 (I) procollagen mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. 5. The results of the present study suggest that emodin may be effective in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
18757754,"Further insights into the mechanism of the reaction of activated bleomycin with DNA.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) is a glycopeptide anticancer drug that effectively carries out single- and double-stranded DNA cleavage. Activated BLM (ABLM), a low-spin ferric-hydroperoxide, BLM-Fe(III)-OOH, is the last intermediate detected before DNA cleavage. We have previously shown through experiments and DFT calculations that both ABLM decay and reaction with H atom donors proceed via direct H atom abstraction. However, the rate of ABLM decay had been previously found, based on indirect methods, to be independent of the presence of DNA. In this study, we use a circular dichroism (CD) feature unique to ABLM to directly monitor the kinetics of ABLM reaction with a DNA oligonucleotide. Our results show that the ABLM + DNA reaction is appreciably faster, has a different kinetic isotope effect, and has a lower Arrhenius activation energy than does ABLM decay. In the ABLM reaction with DNA, the small normal k(H)/k(D) ratio is attributed to a secondary solvent effect through DFT vibrational analysis of reactant and transition state (TS) frequencies, and the lower E(a) is attributed to the weaker bond involved in the abstraction reaction (C-H for DNA and N-H for the decay in the absence of DNA). The DNA dependence of the ABLM reaction indicates that DNA is involved in the TS for ABLM decay and thus reacts directly with BLM-Fe(III)-OOH instead of its decay product.",M2
18719341,"Lung fibrosis 10 years after cessation of bleomycin therapy.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) is a chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of several types of malignancy, including germ cell tumors, lymphoma, and certain types of squamous-cell carcinoma. The common adverse effect of BLM is interstitial pneumonitis, followed by pulmonary fibrosis. BLM-induced pneumonitis occurs in up to 46% of patients treated with BLM-containing chemotherapy and lung toxicity usually appears during treatment. Here we describe a patient with lung fibrosis, who presented with slow progressive breathlessness and pneumothorax more than 10 years after cessation of BLM therapy. A 15 year-old girl presented with abnormal shadows on chest X-ray. The patient had a yolk sac carcinoma in the sacral region at 1 year of age and obtained complete remission after being treated with tumor resection, radiation, and several anti-cancer drugs including BLM. There were no abnormal findings in chest X-ray until she reached 3 years of age, when she had developed respiratory distress that worsened with age. The patient had experienced an episode of pneumothorax at 13 years of age. Chest CT at the time revealed interstitial reticular opacities. Radiological findings and pathological examination of the lung tissue obtained during bullectomy with video-assisted thoracic surgery were compatible with BLM-induced pneumonitis. The present study suggests that lung fibrosis may surface more than 10 years after cessation of BLM therapy at the age of 1 year, with no chest radiographic findings 1 year after completion of chemotherapy. The use of BLM in infants requires strict supervision and observation and careful long-term follow up.",M2
18701972,"[Effects of erdosteine on inflammation and fibrosis in rats with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin]We aimed to investigate the levels of some chemokines, inflammatory cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, histopathological changes in lung tissue, to determine the effect of erdosteine on acute inflammatory changes and fibrosis in a rat fibrosis model induced by bleomycine (<e>BLM</e>). Forty-five Wistar male rats were taken into the study. On day 0, intratracheal saline to control group (group 1, n= 15), intratracheal BLM 7.5 U/kg to BLM (group 2, n= 15) and erdosteine group (group 3, n= 15) was administered. In group 3, oral erdosteine (10 mg/kg/day) was applied two days before BLM. On day 0, 14, and 29th five rats in each groups were sacrificed, BAL fluid was performed. Malonyldialdehyde (MDA), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-2 levels in BAL fluid, hydroxyproline levels in lung tissue were measured. Histopathological examination was performed. When BLM group compared to erdosteine group, the levels of MDA, MIP-1alpha, MIP-2, and neutrophil counts, the hydroxyproline (OH-P) level of lung tissue were decreased in erdosteine group on acute inflammatory phase (day 14) (p&lt; 0.001, p= 0.017, p= 0.009, p&lt; 0.001, p= 0.009, respectively), and late fibrosis phase (day 29) except BAL MIP-2 (p= 0.022, p= 0.025, p= 0.01, p&lt; 0.001, respectively). Fibrosis level was significantly lower in erdosteine group than BLM group on day 29 (p= 0.01). We conclude that erdosteine may prevent the acute lung inflammation and fibrosis by suppressing the accumulation of neutrophils, inhibition of lipid peroxydation, chemokine production, and release.",M2

Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds.",M2
18614556,"Effects of edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, on bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice.Reactive oxygen species play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. The present authors hypothesise that edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, is able to attenuate bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung injury in mice by decreasing oxidative stress. Lung injury was induced in female ICR mice by intratracheal instillation of 5 mg x kg(-1) of BLM. Edaravone (300 mg x kg(-1)) was administered by intraperitoneal administration 1 h before BLM challenge. Edaravone significantly improved the survival rate of mice treated with BLM from 25 to 90%, reduced the number of total cells and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) on day 7, and attenuated the concentrations of lipid hydroperoxide in BALF and serum on day 2. The fibrotic change in the lung on day 28 was ameliorated by edaravone, as evaluated by histological examination and measurement of hydroxyproline contents. In addition, edaravone significantly increased the prostaglandin E(2) concentration in BALF on day 2. In summary, edaravone was shown to inhibit lung injury and fibrosis via the repression of lipid hydroperoxide production and the elevation of prostaglandin E(2) production in the present experimental murine system.",M2
18602243,"Attenuation effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase conjugate on bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo and radiation-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in vitro.In this study, the effects of heparin-superoxide dismutase conjugate (heparin-SOD) on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and on inflammatory cytokine expression in vitro were evaluated. To investigate the effects of heparin-SOD on pulmonary fibrosis, heparin-SOD was administered to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-treated mice by intraperitoneal injection once a day and the hydroxyproline content in lung was determined per 7days. The degree of fibrosis was assessed quantitatively using histopathologic features. The results showed that heparin-SOD inhibited BLM-induced lung fibrotic lesions as reflected by the decrease of lung hydroxyproline content and lung fibrosis grade 28days after BLM instillation. The in vitro effects on the cytokine level expressed by irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts showed that heparin-SOD significantly lowered the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 and interleukin-1beta. These results strongly demonstrated that heparin-SOD might be useful in the prevention and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
18597467,"Identification of strong DNA binding motifs for bleomycin.The bleomycins (<e>BLMs</e>) are clinically used antitumor antibiotics. Their mechanism of action is believed to involve oxidative cleavage of DNA and possibly also RNA degradation. DNA degradation has been studied extensively and shown to involve binding of an activated metallobleomycin to DNA, followed by abstraction of C4'-H from deoxyribose in the rate-limiting step for DNA degradation. It is interesting that while DNA and RNA degradation by activated Fe.BLM has been studied extensively, much less is known about the actual binding selectivity of BLM, that is, the obligatory step that precedes cleavage. Thus it is unclear whether cleavage specificity is defined by the binding event or whether cleavage occurs at a subset of preferred binding sites. With only a few exceptions, NMR binding studies have employed metalloBLMs such as Co.BLM and Zn.BLM whose therapeutic relevance is uncertain. A single biochemical study that compared DNA binding and cleavage directly also employed Co.BLM. It is logical to anticipate that preferred sites of DNA cleavage will occur at sites that are (a subset of) preferred DNA binding sites, but there are currently no data available relevant to this issue. Herein, we describe the development and implementation of a novel strategy to identify DNA motifs that bind BLM strongly.",M2

METHODS: Totally 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group (n = 8) and BLM group (n = 24). Rats in sham group or BLM group were intratracheally instillated with saline or 5 mg/kg of bleomycin, respectively. One, three, and seven days after the instillation of bleomycin, 8 rats in BLM group were taken for AT II isolation and purification. Rats in sham group were used to isolate and purify AT II on 7 days after the instillation of saline. The cell cycle and apoptosis, intracellular free calcium concentration, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in AT II were determined by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and Fas. Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 activities were measured by Caspase activity detection kit. RESULTS: The ratio of S phase AT II in BLM group was significantly lower than in sham group (P &lt; 0.05). AT II apoptosis rates on day 1 and 3 were significantly higher in BLM group than in sham group (P &lt; 0.01). Intracellular free calcium concentrations in BLM group were significantly higher than in sham group (P &lt; 0.05). However, MMP was significantly lower than sham group (P &lt; 0.05). The positive rates of Bax, Fas and Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 activities of BLM group were significantly higher than those of sham group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). The positive rates of Bcl-2 on day 1 and 3 were significantly lower than those of sham group (P &lt; 0.05).

18582404,"Aerosolized STAT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides decrease the concentrations of inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in bleomycin-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis.It has been demonstrated that alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by releasing a variety of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. In addition, abnormal signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) activation in AMs may play a pivotal role in the process of alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we transfected STAT1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASON) into rats by aerosolization, and then investigated the effect of STAT1 ASON on inflammatory mediators such as TGF-beta, PDGF and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from rats with bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. Our results showed that STAT1 ASON by aerosolization could enter into lung tissues and AMs. STAT1 ASON could inhibit mRNA and protein expressions of STAT1 and ICAM-1 in AMs of rat with pulmonary fibrosis, and had no toxic side effect on liver and kidney. Aerosolized STAT1 ASON could ameliorate the alveolitis through inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory mediators in BLM-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that aerosolized STAT1 ASON might be considered as a promising new strategy in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.",M2

At the 29th day, blood samples were taken from cervical artery for blood-gas analysis and parameters of lung function were recorded. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to measure intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) concentration. The results showed that atomization inhaled resveratrol could alleviate rat COPD lung injury accompanied by amelioration of pathological changes, increase the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 0.3 s (FEV0.3) and forced vital capacity (FVC), and decrease the ICAM-1 level in BALF. The ultimate reduction of inflammatory factors was involved, at least in part, in the mechanism of resveratrol effects.",M2
18500976,"Angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist reduces bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.BACKGROUND: The role of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. To evaluate the influence of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and AT2 antagonists in a mouse model of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We examined effects of the AT1 antagonist (AT1A) olmesartan medoxomil (olmesartan) and the AT2 antagonist (AT2A) PD-123319 on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which was evaluated by Ashcroft's pathological scoring and hydroxyproline content of lungs. We also analyzed the cellular composition and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). RESULTS: With olmesartan, the lung fibrosis score and hydroxyproline level were significantly reduced, and lymphocyte and neutrophil counts and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in BALF were reduced on day 7. On day 14, macrophage and lymphocyte counts in BALF were reduced, accompanied by a reduction in the level of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. With PD-123319, the lung fibrosis score and hydroxyproline level were reduced. On day 7, macrophage, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts in BALF were reduced, accompanied by reductions in TNF-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 levels. On day 14, macrophage, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts in BALF were also reduced, accompanied by a reduction in the level of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 level but not TGF-beta1. CONCLUSION: Both AT1 and AT2 are involved in promoting interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis via different mechanisms of action.",M2
18492718,"Mechanistic studies on bleomycin-mediated DNA damage: multiple binding modes can result in double-stranded DNA cleavage.The bleomycins (<e>BLMs</e>) are a family of natural glycopeptides used clinically as antitumor agents. In the presence of required cofactors (Fe(2+) and O(2)), BLM causes both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA damage with the latter thought to be the major source of cytotoxicity. Previous biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated that BLM can mediate ss cleavage through multiple binding modes. However, our studies have suggested that ds cleavage occurs by partial intercalation of BLM's bithiazole tail 3' to the first cleavage site that facilitates its re-activation and re-organization to the second strand without dissociation from the DNA where the second cleavage event occurs. To test this model, a BLM A5 analog (CD-BLM) with beta-cyclodextrin attached to its terminal amine was synthesized. This attachment presumably precludes binding via intercalation. Cleavage studies measuring ss:ds ratios by two independent methods were carried out. Studies using [(32)P]-hairpin technology harboring a single ds cleavage site reveal a ss:ds ratio of 6.7 +/- 1.2:1 for CD-BLM and 3.4:1 and 3.1 +/- 0.3:1 for BLM A2 and A5, respectively. In contrast with BLM A5 and A2, however, CD-BLM mediates ds-DNA cleavage through cooperative binding of a second CD-BLM molecule to effect cleavage on the second strand. Studies using the supercoiled plasmid relaxation assay revealed a ss:ds ratio of 2.8:1 for CD-BLM in comparison with 7.3:1 and 5.8:1, for BLM A2 and A5, respectively. This result in conjunction with the hairpin results suggest that multiple binding modes of a single BLM can lead to ds-DNA cleavage and that ds cleavage can occur using one or two BLM molecules. The significance of the current study to understanding BLM's action in vivo is discussed.",M2

18423134,"[Treatment outcome of primary central nervous system germ cell tumors after combined therapy: a report of 23 cases]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Primary central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare malignant neoplasms with various histological types. Excluding pure germinoma and mature teratoma, other types carry a poor prognosis. Previous investigations focused on combined modality treatment including chemotherapy to improve survival. This study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy combined with surgery and/or radiotherapy on CNS GCTs. METHODS: A total of 23 patients with CNS GCTs were treated in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University from May 2002 to Jun. 2006. The median age at diagnosis was 16 years. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) levels were elevated in 19 patients (82.6%). All patients were treated with chemotherapy of PEB regimen combined with surgery and/or radiotherapy. PEB regimen was administered every 3 weeks with 20 mg/m(2) cisplatin (DDP) at Days 1-5 or 80-100 mg/m(2) at Day 1, 60-100 mg/m(2) etoposide (VP-16) or teniposide (VM-26) at Days 1-5, 10 mg/m(2) bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) at Days 1 and 5. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients, 17 newly diagnosed patients received induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or surgery/radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; 6 recurrent patients received salvage chemotherapy, of which 3 patients with disseminated tumor received salvage chemotherapy followed by craniospinal irradiation. The 23 patients completed a total of 61 cycles of PEB regimen with a median of 3 cycles. Chemotherapy alone gained a response rate of 87.0% and a complete remission rate of 30.4%. Craniospinal irradiation was performed in 14 patients and focal irradiation in 8 patients. One patient did not receive irradiation. Incomplete tumor resection or biopsy was performed in 13 patients. Fourteen patients (60.9%) were alive without evidence of diseases after combined modality treatment. With a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year survival rate was 67.4%. Main adverse events were late irradiation injury including aplastic anemia and hypothalamus syndrome (1 case), irradiation encephalopathy (1 case), and hypopituitarism (2 cases). CONCLUSIONS: The combined modality treatment including PEB regimen is highly effective in treating CNS GCTs patients, especially in the patients with elevated tumor markers. However, the long-term toxicities which related with craniospinal irradiation should not be ignored.",M2
18355908,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 inhibits pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.BACKGROUND: Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are inhibitors of cytokine signaling. Our previous study suggested that SOCS1 regulates collagen synthesis by lung fibroblasts, suggesting a role of SOCS1 in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the role of SOCS1 in pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in vivo. METHODS: SOCS1-haplodeficient mice treated with bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) were evaluated for pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis compared with wild-type mice. The human study group was composed of 18 patients with interstitial lung disease. Lung specimens obtained by means of open lung biopsy were investigated to determine whether the severity of fibrosis was associated with decreased SOCS1 expression. Finally, we further analyzed the effect of exogenous SOCS1 on BLM-induced lung injury based on adenoviral SOCS1 gene transfer to the lung. RESULTS: SOCS1-haplodeficient mice treated with BLM showed markedly enhanced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis compared with wild-type mice. Using human lung specimens, we found that SOCS1 mRNA levels inversely correlated with duration of the disease. SOCS1 expression was significantly less in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) compared with that in non-IPF patients. Moreover, SOCS1 expression was significantly less in severe fibrotic lesions (lower lobe) than in less fibrotic lesions (upper lobe). Adenoviral SOCS1 gene transfer to murine lungs significantly decreased lymphocytic inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and mortality because of BLM-induced lung injury. Exogenous SOCS1 inhibited expression of various cytokines, including TNF-alpha, which might play a key role. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SOCS1 might act as a suppressor for pulmonary fibrosis. SOCS1 might be a target of IPF treatment.",M2
18316335,"Mouse model of dermal fibrosis induced by one-time injection of bleomycin-poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres.OBJECTIVE: Animal models are useful tools to study various aspects of human diseases. Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced scleroderma mouse has been widely investigated as an animal model of scleroderma. Repeated injections of BLM, either daily or every other day, for 3-4 weeks are required to induce scleroderma in mice. Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable, biocompatible and bioabsorbable device that has been widely investigated for controlled drug release. In this study, we fabricated BLM-containing PLA microspheres and subcutaneously injected them into C3H mice for only one time. METHODS: Treated skins were harvested at days 7 and 21. Then, histological examination and collagen content measurement assay were performed. The mRNA expression of alpha1(I) collagen (COL1A1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TGF-beta(1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Dermal fibrosis was histologically observed at day 7 after injection and remained present at day 21. Tissue responses against BLM-PLA microspheres alone were mild. Soluble collagen content and expression level of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA were significantly elevated at day 21. Expression levels of MCP-1 mRNA and TGF-beta(1) mRNA at day 7 and CTGF mRNA at day 21 were also elevated. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated for the first time that one-time injection of BLM-PLA microspheres can induce dermal fibrosis in C3H mice. BLM-PLA microspheres thus offer a labour-saving, simple and powerful tool to establish an animal model of BLM-induced dermal fibrosis.",M2
18234257,"Suppression of a DNA base excision repair gene, hOGG1, increases bleomycin sensitivity of human lung cancer cell line.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) has been found to induce 8-oxoguanine and DNA strand breaks through producing oxidative free radicals, thereby leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and cell death. Cellular DNA damage repair mechanisms such as single strand DNA break repair/base excision repair (BER) are responsible for removing bleomycin-induced DNA damage, therefore confer chemotherapeutic resistance to bleomycin. In this study, we have investigated if down-regulation of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1), an important BER enzyme, could alter cellular sensitivity to bleomycin, thereby reducing chemotherapeutic resistance in human tumor cell. A human lung cancer cell line with hOGG1 deficiency (A549-R) was created by ribozyme gene knockdown technique. Bleomycin cellular sensitivity and DNA/chromosomal damages were examined using MTT, colony forming assay, comet assay as well as micronucleus assay. We demonstrated that hOGG1 gene knockdown enhanced bleomycin cytotoxicity and reduced the ability of colony formation of the lung cancer cell lines. We further demonstrated that bleomycin-induced DNA strand breaks resulted in an increase of micronucleus rate. hOGG1 deficiency significantly reduced DNA damage repair capacity of the lung cancer cell lines. Our results indicated that hOGG1 deficiency allowed the accumulation of bleomycin-induced DNA damage and chromosomal breaks by compromising DNA damage repair capacity, thereby increasing cellular sensitivity to bleomycin.",M2
18206198,"Human inter-individual variability in metabolism and genotoxic response to zidovudine.A mainstay of the antiretroviral drugs used for therapy of HIV-1, zidovudine (AZT) is genotoxic and becomes incorporated into DNA. Here we explored host inter-individual variability in AZT-DNA incorporation, by AZT radioimmunoassay (RIA), using 19 different strains of normal human mammary epithelial cells (NHMECs) exposed for 24 h to 200 microM AZT. Twelve of the 19 NHMEC strains showed detectable AZT-DNA incorporation levels (16 to 259 molecules of AZT/10(6) nucleotides), while 7 NHMEC strains did not show detectable AZT-DNA incorporation. In order to explore the basis for this variability, we compared the 2 NHMEC strains that showed the highest levels of AZT-DNA incorporation (H1 and H2) with 2 strains showing no detectable AZT-DNA incorporation (L1 and L2). All 4 strains had similar (&gt; or =80%) cell survival, low levels of accumulation of cells in S-phase, and no relevant differences in response to the direct-acting mutagen bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). Finally, when levels of thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), the first enzyme in the pathway for incorporation of AZT into DNA, were determined by Western blot analysis in all 19 NHMEC strains at 24 h of AZT exposure, higher TK1 protein levels were found in the 12 strains showing AZT-DNA incorporation, compared to the 7 showing no incorporation (p=0.0005, Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, strains L1 and L2, which did not show AZT-DNA incorporation at 24 h, did have measurable incorporation by 48 and 72 h. These data suggest that variability in AZT-DNA incorporation may be modulated by inter-individual differences in the rate of induction of TK1 in response to AZT exposure.",M2
18205074,"Pulmonary and systemic toxicity of bleomycin on severe combined immune deficiency mice.Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice were more sensitive to systemic delivery of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) than the wild-type strain, and died from esophagitis. Lung injury in the SCID mice by its intratracheal injection, however, was of comparable degree but with less lymphocyte infiltration than that in the wild-type mice. Macrophages and lymphocytes increased transiently in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of SCID mice, whereas their increase in wild-type was continuous. Unsustainable inflammation in the lung might reduce BLM-induced lung injury in BLM-sensitive SCID mice.",M2
18194208,"Deglycosylated bleomycin triggers apoptosis in laryngeal carcinoma cells in a caspase and reactive oxygen species independent manner.BACKGROUND: Bleomycin-A2, a member of a family of glycopeptide antibiotics, has potent antitumor activity against a range of lymphomas, head and neck cancer and germ cell tumors. However, little is known about the biologic activity of the carbohydrate moiety in Bleomycin-A2-induced cytotoxicity. METHODS: We compared the capacity of Bleomycin-A2 and its deglycosylated form (deglycoBleomycin-A2) to induce cell death. Apoptosis was analyzed by cell nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 dye and DNA fragmentation. The signal transduction pathway was measured through Western blotting and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: When tested on HEp-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells, Bleomycin-A2, and deglycoBleomycin-A2 decreased cell viability and clonogenic survival, but Bleomycin-A2 was more toxic than its deglycosylated form. The cell death occurred by apoptosis as identified by condensed chromatin and the formation of apoptotic bodies. While Bleomycin-A2-induced apoptosis was dependent on caspase activation and ROS production, deglycoBleomycin-A2-triggered apoptosis did not require caspase activation and ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: The deglycosylation of Bleomycin-A2 suppresses the ability of the drug to induce ROS formation without hampering its toxic effect. These observations indicate that deglycoBleomycin-A2 may demonstrate a less toxic profile than <e>BLM</e> in the clinic.",M2
18184633,"Variability in cytogenetic adaptive response of cultured human lymphocytes to mitomycin C, bleomycin, quinacrine dihydrochloride, Co60 gamma-rays and hyperthermia.Adaptive response (AR) is a well-documented phenomenon by which cells or organisms exposed to low dose of a genotoxicant become less sensitive to subsequent high-dose exposure to the same or another genotoxicant. AR, if induced can modify the efficacy leading to drug or radio-resistance, during anti-neoplastic drug or radiation treatment. Contradictions exist in AR induction by different genotoxicants with respect to the biomarkers, time schedules, and inter-individual variability, reflecting the complexity of AR in eukaryotic cells. In order to further ascertain these factors, AR induced by anti-neoplastic agents mitomycin C (MMC), bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) and chemosterilant quinacrine dihydrochloride was examined in different donors and time schedules using cytogenetic biomarkers chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei (MN). BLM- and hyperthermia (HT)-induced cross-resistance to gamma rays and MMC/BLM, respectively, was also studied. Difference between MMC- and BLM-induced protective effects in biomarkers examined in the same donors was noticed. Adaptation to BLM and HT showed cross-resistance to chromosome damage induction by gamma rays and BLM/MMC, respectively. Cell cycle analysis indicated that adaptation is not caused by change in the rate of cell proliferation after challenge dose. MN as a chromosomal biomarker in large-scale population studies on AR is advocated, based on similar AR induced in all donors by MMC/BLM and rapid assessment in binucleated cells. Influence of certain genotypes on chromosomal biomarkers used in AR studies and role of AR in radiation and chemotherapy need to be further deciphered.",M2
18184548,"[A rat model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by infusing bleomycin quickly through tracheal intubation]OBJECTIVE: To study the approach for developing a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). METHOD: Different doses (7, 6, 5, 3.4, 2, 1 mg/kg) of bleomycin A5-saline were infused into the rats' lung in bleomycin-treated group through tracheal intubation, and rats in sham-operated group were infused with same volume of saline. The living state and lung pathology of the rats were observed. The author deeply studied the condition of the rats in 1 mg/kg bleomycin-treated group, and the changes of body weight and lung pathology were observed. Lung quotient, the content of transforming growth factor beta1(TGF-beta1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in serum were measured on the 14th, 28th and 45th day of the experiment. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that infusing large doses of bleomycin A5 quickly through tracheal intubation had a high mortality, and infusing 1 mg/kg quickly could successfully develop an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with the sham-operated group, fibrosis was appeared obviously in the rats' lung in 1 mg/kg bleomycin A5-treated group after 14 days of experiment, diffuse fibrosis was appeared after 28 days of experiment, and the fibrosis became more severe after 45 days of experiment. The body weight of the rats in bleomycin-treated group was declined after 3, 7 and 14 days of experiment as compared with the sham-operated group (P&lt;0.01). Twenty-one days after the experiment, the body weight was declined too, but there was no significant difference between the bleomycin-treated group and the sham-operated group (P&gt;0.05). Lung quotient was increased 14, 28 and 45 days after the experiment (P&lt;0.01), the level of serum TGF-beta1 began to increase since 28 days after the experiment (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01), and the level of serum PDGF also increased gradually 45 days after the experiment (P&lt;0.05). And the mortality rate of 1 mg/kg bleomycin A5-treated group was lower than those of the other doses of bleomycin A5-treated groups. CONCLUSION: A rat model of pulmonary fibrosis can be duplicated successfully by infusing 1 mg/kg bleomycin A5 quickly through tracheal intubation.",M2
18182988,"Vascular disrupting action of electroporation and electrochemotherapy with bleomycin in murine sarcoma.Electrochemotherapy has a direct cytotoxic effect on tumour cells, and presumably, a vascular disrupting effect. In this study, on the basis of the prediction of the mathematical model, histological evaluation and physiological measurements of the tumours were carried out to confirm that electroporation and electrochemotherapy of tumours have a vascular disrupting action. In the study, SA-1 solid subcutaneous sarcoma tumours in A/J mice were treated by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) given intravenously (1 mg kg(-1)), application of electric pulses (8 pulses, 1040 V, 100 micros, 1 Hz) or a combination of both - electrochemotherapy. The vascular effect was determined by laser Doppler flowmetry, power Doppler ultrasonographic imaging and Patent blue staining. The extent of tumour hypoxia was determined immunohistochemically by hypoxia marker pimonidazole and partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in tumours by electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry. Electrochemotherapy with BLM induced good antitumour effect with 22 days, tumour growth delay and 38% tumour cures. The application of electric pulses to the tumours induced instant but transient tumour blood flow reduction (for 70%) that was recovered in 24 h. During this tumour blood flow reduction, we determined an increase in hypoxic tumour area for up to 30%, which was also reflected in reduced tumour oxygenation (for 70%). According to the described mathematical model, endothelial cells lining in tumour blood vessels are exposed to a approximately 40% higher electric field than the surrounding tumour cells, and therefore easily electroporated, allowing access of high BLM concentration to the cytosol. Consequently, electrochemotherapy has, besides the immediate vascular disrupting action, also a delayed one (after 24 h), as a consequence of endothelial cell swelling and apoptosis demonstrated by extensive tumour necrosis, tumour hypoxia, prolonged reduction of tumour blood flow and significant tumour growth delay, and tumour cures. Our results demonstrate that in addition to the well-established direct cytotoxic effect on tumour cells, electrochemotherapy also has an indirect vascular disrupting action resulting altogether in extensive tumour cell necrosis leading to complete regression of tumours.",M2
18174229,"Effectiveness of etanercept in bleomycin-induced experimental scleroderma.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of etanercept and thalidomide in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced scleroderma (<e>BLM</e>-IS). METHODS: This study involved four groups (n = 8 mice in each group). Dermal sclerosis was induced by repeated subcutaneous injections of BLM (10 microg) for 4 weeks in BALB/c mice. Control group received only phosphate-buffered saline. The second group received only BLM; the third and fourth groups were also given an intraperitoneal injection of 100 microg etanercept or 150 mg/kg thalidomide, respectively. RESULTS: BLM increased serum TGF-beta1, tissue hydroxyproline levels and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and dermal fibrosis was histopathologically prominent. Although thalidomide had no significant effect, etanercept caused decreases in levels of serum TGF-beta1, tissue hydroxyproline and number of alpha-SMA-positive cells. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of TNF-alpha with etanercept in BLM-IS was resulted in a significant reduction of the dermal sclerosis, collagen accumulation and the number of infiltrating myofibroblastic cells. TNF-alpha may play a key role in the progression of BLM-IS and TNF-alpha antagonists may be useful in the management of scleroderma.",M2
18164039,"Analysis of spontaneous and bleomycin-induced chromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes of long-haul aircrew members from Argentina.Spontaneous and bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced chromosomal aberrations in G0 and G2 stages of the cell cycle have been analyzed in peripheral lymphocytes of 21 long-haul aircrew members from Argentina in order to assess BLM-induced clastogenesis as a first approach to determine the DNA repair capacity and thereby the susceptibility to environmental cancers in aircrew. The possibility that occupational exposure of flight personnel to cosmic radiation can induce an adaptive response in their peripheral lymphocytes that can be detected by a subsequent in vitro treatment with BLM was also investigated. For comparison, aberrations were also scored in the lymphocytes of 15 healthy volunteers matched by age, health, sex, drinking and smoking habits to the flight personnel group. Aircrew exhibited a higher frequency of spontaneous dicentrics and ring chromosomes than the control population (p&lt;0.05). BLM sensitivity test showed that aircrew and controls are equally sensitive to BLM G2 clastogenic effects, since both groups exhibited a similar frequency of chromatid breaks per cell (p&gt;0.05). However, the aircrew sampled population was almost two times more sensitive to BLM G0 clastogenic effects than controls (p&lt;0.05). Therefore, our data suggest that chronic exposure of aircrew to cosmic radiation increases the in vitro chromosomal sensitivity of their peripheral lymphocytes to BLM (at least in the G0 stage of the cell cycle), and that occupational exposure of flight personnel to cosmic radiation does not induce an adaptive response to this radiomimetic compound. Our results justify further studies aimed at determine if those aircrew members hypersensitive to BLM are more prone to develop environmental cancer than BLM-insensitive individuals.",M2
18096870,"Role of interleukin-6 in bleomycin-induced lung inflammatory changes in mice.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, but its role in bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung injury and subsequent fibrotic changes remains to be determined. We evaluated the role of IL-6 in the lung inflammatory changes induced by BLM using wild-type (WT) and IL-6-deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice. The mice were treated intratracheally with 1 mg/kg BLM and killed 2, 7, or 21 days later. Lung Inflammation in the acute phase (Days 2 and 7) was assessed by differential cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cytokine levels in the lung. Lung fibrotic changes were evaluated on Day 21 by histopathology and collagen assay. On Day 2, BLM administration induced significant increases in the numbers of total cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in BAL fluid, which were attenuated in IL-6(-/-) mice (P &lt; 0.05). Lung pathology also showed inflammatory cell accumulation, which was attenuated in the IL-6(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. In WT mice, elevated levels of TGF-beta(1) and CCL3 were observed 2 and 7 days after BLM challenge, respectively. On Day 7, BLM-induced inflammatory cell accumulation did not differ between the genotypes. Lung pathology 21 days after BLM challenge revealed significant fibrotic changes with increased collagen content, which was attenuated in IL-6(-/-) mice. Although the TGF-beta(1) level in the lung did not differ between the genotypes on Day 21, CCL3 was significantly lower in IL-6(-/-) mice. These results indicate that IL-6 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BLM-induced lung injury and subsequent fibrotic changes.",M2
18008008,"Telomerase activity is required for bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.In addition to its well-known expression in the germline and in cells of certain cancers, telomerase activity is induced in lung fibrosis, although its role in this process is unknown. To identify the pathogenetic importance of telomerase in lung fibrosis, we examined the effects of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) deficiency in a murine model of pulmonary injury. TERT-deficient mice showed significantly reduced lung fibrosis following bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) insult. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in expression of lung alpha-SMA, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, lung fibroblasts isolated from BLM-treated TERT-deficient mice showed significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis rates compared with cells isolated from control mice. Transplantation of WT BM into TERT-deficient mice restored BLM-induced lung telomerase activity and fibrosis to WT levels. Conversely, transplantation of BM from TERT-deficient mice into WT recipients resulted in reduced telomerase activity and fibrosis. These findings suggest that induction of telomerase in injured lungs may be caused by BM-derived cells, which appear to play an important role in pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, TERT induction is associated with increased survival of lung fibroblasts, which favors the development of fibrosis instead of injury resolution.",M2
18000056,"Two closely related RecQ helicases have antagonistic roles in homologous recombination and DNA repair in Arabidopsis thaliana.RecQ helicases are involved in the processing of DNA structures arising during replication, recombination, and repair throughout all kingdoms of life. Mutations of different RecQ homologues are responsible for severe human diseases, such as Blooms (<e>BLM</e>) or Werner (WRN) syndrome. The loss of RecQ function is often accompanied by hyperrecombination caused by a lack of crossover suppression. In the Arabidopsis genome seven different RecQ genes are present. Two of them (AtRECQ4A and 4B) arose because of a recent duplication and are still nearly 70% identical on a protein level. Knockout of these genes leads to antagonistic phenotypes: the RECQ4A mutant shows sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, enhanced homologous recombination (HR) and lethality in a mus81 background. Moreover, mutation of RECQ4A partially suppresses the lethal phenotype of an AtTOP3alpha mutant, a phenomenon that had previously been demonstrated for RecQ homologues of unicellular eukaryotes only. Together, these facts strongly suggest that in plants RECQ4A is functionally equivalent to SGS1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the mammalian BLM protein. In stark contrast, mutants of the closely related RECQ4B are not mutagen-sensitive, not viable in a mus81 background, and unable to suppress the induced lethality caused by loss of TOP3alpha. Moreover, they are strongly impaired in HR. Thus, AtRECQ4B is specifically required to promote but not to suppress crossovers, a role in which it differs from all eukaryotic RecQ homologues known.",M2
17986108,"Preventive effect of hochu-ekki-to, a Japanese herbal medicine, on bleomycin-induced lung injury in mice.OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be closely associated with the T-helper type-2 (Th2) immune response. Recent studies have shown that hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41), a Japanese herbal medicine, may correct the Th1/Th2 imbalance skewed to Th2. The present study was designed to investigate the preventive effect of TJ-41 on the development of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced lung injury in mice. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into a group given ordinary feed and another group given the same feed plus TJ-41 mixed in at a dose of 1 g/kg/day. Both groups were maintained on this diet for 8 weeks before and 5 weeks after administration of 2 mg/kg BLM intratracheally. RESULTS: Mortality after BLM-induced lung injury was significantly lower in the TJ-41-treated mice. The hydroxyproline content and fluid content in the lung on day 35 was significantly lower in the TJ-41-treated mice. Histologically, TJ-41 reduced the number of infiltrating cells, thus ameliorating the destruction of the lung architecture, and attenuated the lung fibrosis score. Furthermore, TJ-41 inhibited the expression of the interleukin-5/interferon-gamma mRNA ratio in the lung on day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with TJ-41 partially prevented experimental lung fibrosis through the correction of the Th1/Th2 imbalance skewed to Th2.",M2
17953974,"Inherited susceptibility to bleomycin-induced micronuclei: correlating polymorphisms in GSTT1, GSTM1 and DNA repair genes with mutagen sensitivity.Susceptibility to DNA damage varies among individuals and sensitivity to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) may reflect the inter-individual differences. BLM sensitivity in part may be explained by inherited differences in DNA repair genes. We investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms in the GSTT1, GSTM1, XPD, XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes and the levels of spontaneous and BLM-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 200 healthy, unexposed individuals. The investigation of BLM sensitivity on cancer- or disease-free subjects and not occupationally exposed to known mutagen represents the strengths of the present study, as the detection of genetic damage is not biased by any disease- and occupational-related factor. The micronucleus (MN) assay was used to detect the spontaneous and BLM-induced genetic damage whereas, genotype analysis was carried out using methods based on polymerase chain reaction. Poisson regression analysis showed that subject's age, gender and smoking status had no effect on the spontaneous and BLM-induced MN frequencies. Genotype analysis revealed a clear association between GSTT1-null and XPD polymorphisms and both spontaneous and BLM-induced MN frequencies, whereas the effect of the XRCC1 polymorphism was marginally significant only with regard to spontaneous MN frequency. Genotype analysis did not reveal a clear association between the other studied SNPs (GSTM1 and XRCC3) and MN frequencies. Poisson regression analysis revealed no association between the score of protective alleles and the frequency of spontaneous MN. However, an increased number of protective alleles was significantly associated with a lower frequency of BLM-induced MN (P=0.0003). This finding highlights the genetic basis for BLM sensitivity, which could be a valid and useful surrogate for identifying genotypes that might increase susceptibility in population exposed to carcinogens. Further investigations in a large sample size and including more SNPs, reflecting the complexity of DNA repair machinery, might lead to the identification of a genetic profile responsible for the susceptibility to genotoxicants, with a far-reaching long-term impact on primary prevention and early detection of disease associated genes.",M2
17950632,"Role of carbohydrate moiety of bleomycin-A2 in caspase-3 activation and internucleosomal chromatin fragmentation in apoptosis of laryngeal carcinoma cells.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), an antitumor antibiotic, is currently used during anticancer therapy. The therapeutic efficiency of BLM for the treatment of malignant tumors is related to its ability to cleave DNA. However, little is known about the biological activity of the glycannic moiety in BLM-induced cytotoxicity. In this study, cell death induced by BLM-A2 and deglycosylated BLM-A2 was studied in a laryngeal carcinoma cell line (HEp-2 cells). Our results indicate that HEp-2 cells showed morphological and biochemical changes associated with apoptosis in the presence of low concentrations of BLM-A2. In contrast, the same changes, except activation of caspase-3 and internucleosomal digestion of genomic DNA, were observed when cells were exposed to high concentrations of deglycosylated BLM-A2. These observations indicate that the glycannic moiety from the bleomycin molecule has important biological effects on the cytotoxicity of the drug.",M2
17904883,"Attenuation of bleomycin-induced lung injury and oxidative stress by N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary injury and antioxidant therapy may be useful with impaired oxidative defense mechanism. This study examines the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and deferoxamine (DFX) on inflammatory indicators and oxidative stress in the lungs of mice exposed to bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). The animals received endotracheally a single dose of BLM (2.5 U/kg body weight dissolved in 0.25 ml of 0.9% NaCl) or saline (0.9% NaCl) and were divided into eight groups (n=8): saline; BLM; saline+NAC; BLM+NAC; saline+DFX; BLM+DFX; saline+NAC+DFX; BLM+NAC+DFX. Treatments with NAC (20mg/kg) or DFX (30 mg/kg) were administered for 60 days after BLM exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and total cell count, neutrophil and protein concentration were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), oxidative protein damage (carbonyl contents), and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were determined in the lung tissue. BLM administration resulted in lung lesion as determinated lung histology, which is almost completely prevented by NAC plus DFX. The results of total cell counts and neutrophils and LDH increased after BLM exposure and were reduced with NAC. DFX and NAC plus DFX also caused a significant decrease of LDH activity. The increased malondialdehyde equivalents and carbonyl contents in lung tissue produced by BLM were also prevented by NAC plus DFX. However, the isolated use of NAC increased lipid peroxidation. SOD activity increased after BLM exposure only in the group treated with DFX and catalase activity not was altered in the presence of BLM. Data presented here indicates that the isolated use of NAC had limited effects on BLM-induced pulmonary oxidative stress in mice. The use of DFX improves the defense response and in association with NAC may be a good alternative in the treatment or prevention of diseases that have ROS and iron involved in their pathogenesis.",M2
17896392,"Bleomycin-induced lung injury assessed noninvasively and in spontaneously breathing rats by proton MRI.PURPOSE: To apply proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess noninvasively and in spontaneously breathing rats, structural changes following a single intratracheal administration of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were scanned by MRI prior to BLM or vehicle administration and at six hours, 24 hours, week 1, and at weeks 2, 3, 6, and 8 after treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and histological analyses were performed at 24 hours, and at weeks 1 and 8 (histology only). RESULTS: Prominent MRI fluid signals were detected in the lungs of BLM-treated rats one week after challenge. These signals correlated with increased inflammatory parameters in BAL fluid and with marked perivascular and parenchymal infiltration with inflammatory cells in histological slices. At week 2 the MRI signals due to edema resolved, but nevertheless an increase in MRI signal intensity from the lung parenchyma was apparent. In some areas of the right lung the MRI signal intensity in the parenchyma decreased between weeks 2 and 8. These observations were in line with histology demonstrating collagen deposition and atelectasis (hallmarks of fibrosis) at week 1 and a partial recovery of the lung parenchyma at week 8. CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate the ability of proton MRI to detect BLM-induced lung fibrosis as well as the acute inflammatory response caused by the agent.",M2
17887752,"Biochemical evaluation of a 108-member deglycobleomycin library: viability of a selection strategy for identifying bleomycin analogues with altered properties.The bleomycins (<e>BLMs</e>) are clinically used glycopeptide antitumor antibiotics that have been shown to mediate the sequence-selective oxidative damage of both DNA and RNA. Previously, we described the solid-phase synthesis of a library of 108 unique analogues of deglycoBLM A6, a congener that cleaves DNA analogously to BLM itself. Each member of the library was assayed for its ability to effect single- and double-strand nicking of duplex DNA, sequence-selective DNA cleavage, and RNA cleavage in the presence and absence of a metal ion cofactor. All of the analogues tested were found to mediate concentration-dependent plasmid DNA relaxation to some extent, and a number exhibited double-strand cleavage with an efficiency comparable to or greater than deglycoBLM A6. Further, some analogues having altered linker and metal-binding domains mediated altered sequence-selective cleavage, and a few were found to cleave a tRNA3Lys transcript both in the presence and in the absence of a metal cofactor. The results provide insights into structural elements within BLM that control DNA and RNA cleavage. The present study also permits inferences to be drawn regarding the practicality of a selection strategy for the solid-phase construction and evaluation of large libraries of BLM analogues having altered properties.",M2
17886030,"Recombinant human thioredoxin-1 becomes oxidized in circulation and suppresses bleomycin-induced neutrophil recruitment in the rat airway.Thioredoxin-1 (TRX) is a redox-active protein with anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated the optimal delivery method and the mechanisms of recombinant human TRX (rhTRX) to suppress neutrophil recruitment in a rat bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced sustained acute lung injury model. In male Wister rats intratracheally administered with 0.125 mg/kg BLM, 8 mg/kg/day rhTRX was intravenously administered on days 3-6 using one of three protocols: daily bolus injection, 3 h daily infusion or continuous infusion for 96 h. Only the continuous-infusion of rhTRX significantly reduced the neutrophil infiltration compared with the other two methods. The BLM-induced down-regulation of L-selectin expression on circulating neutrophils was inhibited by rhTRX. Oxidized rhTRX showed a comparable effect with reduced rhTRX and rhTRX incubated with plasma or circulating in plasma was more than 99% oxidized. These results suggest that rhTRX becomes oxidized in circulation and continuous infusion of rhTRX suppresses neutrophil recruitment in the airway.",M2
17883878,"A new therapy for highly effective tumor eradication using HVJ-E combined with chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Inactivated HVJ (hemagglutinating virus of Japan; Sendai virus) particles (HVJ envelope vector; HVJ-E can incorporate and deliver plasmid DNA, siRNA, antibody and peptide and anti-cancer drugs to cells both in vitro and in vivo. We attempted to eradicate tumors derived from mouse colon cancer cells, CT26, by combining bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-incorporated HVJ-E (HVJ-E/BLM) with cisplatin (CDDP) administration. METHODS: CT-26 tumor mass was intradermally established in Balb/c mice. HVJ-E/BLM was directly injected into the tumor mass with or without intraperitoneal administration of CDDP. The anti-tumor effect was evaluated by measuring tumor size and cytotoxic T cell activity against CT26. Re-challenge of tumor cells to treated mice was performed 10 days or 8 months after the initial tumor inoculation. RESULTS: We found that three intratumoral injections of HVJ-E/BLM along with a single intraperitoneal administration of CDDP eradicated CT26 tumors with more than 75% efficiency. When tumor cells were intradermally re-injected on day 10 after the initial tumor inoculation, tumors on both sides disappeared in most of the mice that received the combination therapy of HVJ-E/BLM and CDDP. Eight months after the initial tumor eradication, surviving mice were re-challenged with CT26 cells. The re-challenged tumors were rejected in all of the surviving mice treated with the combination therapy. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for CT26 were generated in these surviving mice. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy consisting of HVJ-E and chemotherapy completely eradicated the tumor, and generated anti-tumor immunity. The combination therapy could therefore be a promising new strategy for cancer therapy.",M2
17880775,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inhibition attenuates the development of bleomycin-induced lung injury.Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an ubiquitous serine-threonine protein kinase that participates in a multitude of cellular processes and has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of TDZD-8, a potent and selective GSK-3beta inhibitor, on the development of lung injury caused by administration of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>). Mice subjected to intra-tracheal administration of BLM developed significant lung injury characterized by marked neutrophil infiltration and tissue edema. An increase in immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine, iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was also observed in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. In contrast, administration of BLM-treated mice with TDZD-8 (1 mg/kg daily) significantly reduced (I) the degree of lung injury, (II) the increase in staining (immunohistochemistry) for myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitrotyrosine, iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and (III) the degree of apoptosis, as evaluated by Bax and Bcl-2 immunoreactivity and TUNEL staining. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate treatment with the GSK-3beta inhibitor TDZD-8 reduces the development of lung injury and inflammation induced by BLM in mice.",M2
17825850,"Induction of complete and incomplete chromosome aberrations by bleomycin in human lymphocytes.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) is a clastogenic compound, which due to the overdispersion in the cell distribution of induced dicentrics has been compared to the effect of high-LET radiation. Recently, it has been described that in fibroblast derived cell lines BLM induces incomplete chromosome elements more efficiently than any type of ionizing radiation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate in human lymphocytes the induction of dicentrics and incomplete chromosome elements by BLM. Peripheral blood samples have been treated with different concentrations of BLM. Two cytogenetic techniques were applied, fluorescence plus Giemsa (FPG) and FISH using pan-centromeric and pan-telomeric probes. The observed frequency of dicentric equivalents increases linearly with the BLM concentration, and for all BLM concentrations the distribution of dicentric equivalents was overdispersed. In the FISH study the ratio between total incomplete elements and multicentrics was 0.27. The overdispersion in the dicentric cell distribution, and the linear BLM-concentration dependence of dicentrics can be compared to the effect of high-LET radiation, on the contrary the ratio of incomplete elements and multicentrics is similar to the one induced by low-LET radiation (~0.40). The elevated proportion of interstitial deletions in relation to total acentric fragments, higher than any type of ionizing radiation could be a characteristic signature of the clastogenic effect of BLM.",M2
17825263,"Deglycosylated bleomycin induces apoptosis in lymphoma cell via c-jun NH2-terminal kinase but not reactive oxygen species.Bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) has demonstrated potent activity in treating malignant lymphomas but its therapeutic efficacy is hampered by induction of lung fibrosis. This side effect is related to the ability of the drug to generate reactive oxygen species in lung cells. In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of deglycosylation of BLM in term of cytotoxic activity and generation of reactive oxygen species. When tested on U937 human lymphoma cells, both compounds generated a typical apoptotic phenotype. Cell death induction was associated with Bax oligomerization, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, chromatin condensation and internucleosomal degradation. Whereas both reactive oxygen species and c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors prevented BLM-induced U937 cell death, only JNK inhibition prevented deglycosylated BLM-mediated cell death. Both compounds induced clustering of TRAIL receptors (DR4 and DR5) and Fas at the cell surface but neither a chimeric soluble DR5 receptor that inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death nor a dominant negative version of the adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain prevented BLM-induced cytotoxicity. These observations indicate that deglycosylation of BLM does not impair the ability of the drug to trigger cell death through activation of the intrinsic pathway but prevents induction of reactive oxygen species. This observation suggests that deglycosylated BLM could exhibit less toxic side effects and could warrant its use in clinic.",M2
17716779,"Randomized phase II trial of three intrapleural therapy regimens for the management of malignant pleural effusion in previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer: JCOG 9515.To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of three intrapleural therapy regimens consisting of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), OK-432 (a pulverized product of heat-killed Streptococcus pyogenes) or cisplatin plus etoposide (PE) for the management of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible patients were randomized to the BLM arm: BLM 1mg/kg (maximum 60mg/body), the OK-432 arm: OK-432 0.2 Klinische Einheit units (KE)/kg (maximum 10KE/body), or the PE arm: cisplatin (80mg/m(2)) and etoposide (80mg/m(2)). Pleural response was evaluated every 4 weeks according to the study-specific criteria. All responders received systemic chemotherapy consisting of PE every 3-4 weeks for two or more courses. Pleural progression-free survival (PPFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of pleural progression or death due to any cause. The primary endpoint was the 4-week PPFS rate. Of 105 patients enrolled, 102 were assessed for response. The 4-week PPFS rate for the BLM arm was 68.6%, 75.8% for the OK-432 arm, and 70.6% for PE arm. Median survival time (MST) for the BLM arm was 32.1 weeks, 48.1 weeks for the OK-432 arm, and 45.7 weeks for the PE arm. However, the outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. Toxicity was tolerable in all arms except for one treatment-related death due to interstitial pneumonia induced by BLM. We will select intrapleural treatment using OK-432 in the management of MPE in NSCLC for further investigation because it had the highest 4-week PPFS rate.",M2
17713091,"Irradiation reduces bleomycin sensitivity in cervical squamous cancer cells in vitro.PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The study was performed to examine how bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) and peplomycin (PEM) should be effectively used in radiotherapy for cervical squamous cancer patients. METHODS: The effects of BLM on radiosensitivity and the effects of radiation on the sensitivity to BLM of cancer cells were investigated using the radiosensitive human cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line ME180. RESULTS: BLM treatment did not affect radiosensitivity. However, irradiation significantly reduced cell BLM sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. There was no significant difference in BLM sensitivity and PEM sensitivity between cells concurrently irradiated and those treated with BLM or PEM 8 h before or 8 h after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Since sensitivity to BLM is reduced during irradiation, BLM should be administered to cervical cancer patients as an adjuvant chemotherapeutic drug after completion of radiotherapy.",M2
17685459,"Polymorphism in nucleotide excision repair gene XPC correlates with bleomycin-induced chromosomal aberrations.Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) are important genetic alterations in the development and progression of the majority of human cancers. The frequency with which such alterations occur depends to a large extent on polymorphisms of DNA-repair genes and in genes coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, which are involved in the processes of activation and inactivation of xenobiotics. The frequency of bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced CAs is an indirect measure of the effectiveness of DNA repair mechanisms, and a predictor of environment-related risk of cancer. Our study was conducted on the human peripheral blood lymphocytes of 82 healthy volunteers. The aim of the study was to elucidate whether the frequency of BLM-induced CAs is correlated with polymorphisms of selected genes involved in different mechanisms of DNA repair such as: XRCC1 [base excision repair]; XPA, XPC, XPG, XPD, XPF, ERCC1 [nucleotide excision repair], NBS1, RAD51, XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51, and BRCA1 [homologous recombination], as well as in genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP1A, CYP2E1, NAT2, GSTT1, and EPHX (mEH). Our study indicated that, of the polymorphisms studied, only XPC (exon 15 and intron 11) is associated with BLM-induced CAs, suggesting a role of the NER pathway in the repair of BLM-induced chromosomal aberrations.",M2
17487418,"Therapeutic effects of alpha-lipoic acid on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats.Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a major side effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials, unfortunately, have failed to identify any therapeutic agent which has the potential to reduce the consequences of this devastating condition. Reactive oxygen species and tissue remodeling regulators, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs), are thought to be involved in the development of PF. We investigated these factors to determine the protective effects of antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (LA) against antineoplastic agent bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>)-induced oxidant lung toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats. At different time intervals after BLM administration, pathological changes of the lung were analyzed with the measurement of total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), hydroxyproline (HYP) content and the level of three oxidative stress markers, i.e. malondialdehyde (MDA), the GSH/GSSG ratio, and total antioxidative capability (T-AOC). Also, the expression changes of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 were measured. At day 14 or 28 after BLM administration, protein content in BALF, and HYP, MDA and T-AOC contents of the lung increased significantly with a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, implicating an increased efflux of GSSG from the lung and consumption of GSH. In contrast, treatment with LA protected BLM-induced pulmonary injury by suppressing oxidative stress with the reduction of MDA, and the enhancement of the GSH/GSSG ratio and T-AOC. The BLM-stimulated symptoms of PF were relieved with significant reduction of HYP and total proteins in LA-treated rats. LA also ameliorated the MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio. These results suggest that LA inhibits BLM-induced lung toxicity associated with oxidative damage. Therefore, antioxidant LA has a potential therapeutic effect in the prevention and alleviation of PF.",M2
17430657,"[Predictive value of in vitro MTT assay chemosensitivity test of cytotoxic drug activity in cervical cancer]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cervical cancer has evoked more and more attention and has been used widely. But the chemosensitivity of individuals to various antitumor drugs is different. This study was to investigate the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to antitumor drugs using in vitro MTT assay chemosensitivity test. METHODS: The sensitivity of fresh human cervical cancer cells from 32 patients to 9 cytotoxic drugs was tested using in vitro MTT assay. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activities of the 9 drugs for cervical cancer were in sequence from high to low as follows: liposomal paclitaxel, taxol, carboplatin (CBP), ifosfamide (IFO), etoposide (VP-16), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (DDP), bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), and cyclophosphamide (CTX). Generally, cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel, taxol, and CBP than to other drugs (P&lt;0.05) with inhibition rates of 56.56%, 55.66%, and 46.81%, respectively. Stage Ib1 cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to taxol, paclitaxel, and CBP than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 58.71%, 53.00%, and 49.25%, respectively; stage Ib2 cervical cancer cells were more sensitive to paclitaxel and taxol than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 65.26% and 50.06%. Both moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell cancer cells were more sensitive to taxol, paclitaxel, and CBP than to other drugs with inhibition rates of 52.01%, 49.21%, and 40.02% for the former, and 60.02%, 61.16%, and 48.75% for the latter. CONCLUSIONS: MTT assay, a sensitive and widely used chemosensitivity testing method, is helpful in sensitive drug screening and neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen selection for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer cells are more sensitive to paclitaxel, taxol, and CBP than to other tested drugs in this study.",M2
17428504,"Modulation of the genotoxicity of bleomycin by amines through noncovalent DNA interactions and alteration of physiological conditions in yeast.The effects of amines on the induction of mitotic gene conversion by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) were studied at the trp5 locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D7. BLM induces double-strand breaks in DNA and is a potent recombinagen in this assay. The polyamine spermidine causes concentration-dependent protection against the genotoxicity of BLM, reducing the convertant frequency by over 90% under the most protective conditions. Spermine, diethylenetriamine, ethylenediamine, putrescine, and ethylamine were also antigenotoxic in combined treatments with BLM. There was a general correspondence between the protective effect and the number of amino groups, suggesting that more strongly cationic amines tend to be stronger antirecombinagens. Electrostatic association of the amines with DNA probably hinders BLM access to the 4' position of deoxyribose where it generates a free radical. Other amines interact with BLM differently from these unbranched aliphatic amines. The aminothiol cysteamine inhibits the genotoxicity of BLM under hypoxic conditions but increases it under euoxic conditions. In contrast, pargyline potentiates the genotoxicity of BLM under hypoxic conditions but not under euoxic conditions. The antirecombinagenic effect of cysteamine apparently involves DNA binding and depletion of oxygen needed for BLM activity, whereas its potentiation of BLM entails its serving as an electron source for the activation of BLM. Pargyline may enhance BLM indirectly by preventing the depletion of oxygen by monoamine and polyamine oxidase. The planar 9-aminoacridine weakly induces gene conversion in strain D7, but it is strongly synergistic with BLM. Enhancement of BLM activity by this compound and by the related nitroacridine Entozon is apparently mediated by intercalation of the acridine ring system into DNA. Thus, the influence of amines on the genotoxicity of BLM in yeast encompasses antigenotoxic, potentiating, and synergistic interactions. The underlying mechanisms involve noncovalent association with DNA, altered BLM access to DNA, and modulation of physiological conditions.",M2
17425852,"[Effects of antisense oligonucleotide to nuclear factor-kappaB on the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and IL-4 expression therein: experiment with mice]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its effects on IL-4 expression therein, and to investigate the therapeutic role of antisense oligonucleotide (ASON) to NF-kappaB on IPF. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) group (n = 35, injected with BLM through caudal vein), control group [n = 20, injected with normal saline (NS) via caudal vein], ASON group (n = 35, injected with ASON to p65, a subunit of NF-kappaB, at the dose of 900 microg), and SON group (n = 35, injected with sense oligonucleotide to p65 subunit). Six hours after intravenous injection, the BLM, ASON, and SON groups were treated with BLM-A5 (5 mg/kg dissolved in 20 microl NS) by intratracheal installation, and the control group was treated with NS (20 microl). 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days following intratracheal instillation of BLM or 0.5, 1, 14 days following intratracheal instillation of NS, 5 mice of every group were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. The BALF was collected and assayed with ELISA for IL-4. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and microscope image analysis were completed to detect the expression of p65 and IL-4 in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells. Another 5 mice from each group were sacrificed 28 days after intratracheal instillation with their total right lungs taken out to undergo pathohistological examination. The content of hydroxyproline in the left lung was detected by high performance liquid chromatography and ELISA. RESULTS: (1) Twenty-eight days after intratracheal instillation, the BLM and the SON groups showed consolidation of the lung parenchyma with loss of the alveolar architecture and increased cellularity, while the ASON and control groups showed no significant pulmonary consolidation or fibrosis. (2) Twenty-eight days after intratracheal instillation, the hydroxyproline content of the BLM group was 876.8 +/- 91.1 nmol/lung, significantly higher than that of the control group (347.6 +/- 53.9 nmol/lung, t = -9.833, P &lt; 0.001); the hydroxyproline content of the ASON group was 505.6 +/- 34.8 nmol/lung, significantly lower than that of the BLM group (t = -9.862, P &lt; 0.001); however, the hydroxyproline content of the SON group was 775.2 +/- 68.9 nmol/lung, not significantly different from that of the BLM group (t = 2.118, P = 0.102). (3) One day after the intratracheal instillation of BLM, the value of average integral optical density of p65 in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells of the BLM, SON, and ASON groups were 275 +/- 13, 233 +/- 60, 233 +/- 60, and 126 +/- 34 respectively, all significantly higher that of the control group (38 +/- 18, t = 27.350, 8.039, and 6.107, P &lt; 0.001, = 0.001, and = 0.004), that of the ASON group being significantly lower than those of the BLM and SON groups (t = 7.664 and -3.407, P = 0.002 and 0.027). (4) IHC showed that 1 day after the intratracheal instillation, the value of average integral optical density of IL-4 of the BLM, SON, and ASON groups were 134 +/- 16, 128 +/- 2, and 80 +/- 9 respectively, all significantly higher than that of the control group (33 +/- 12, t = 10.346, -5.927, and 5.313, P &lt; 0.001, = 0.004, = 0.006), that of the ASON group being significantly lower than those of the BLM and SON groups (t = 6.967 and -3.591, P = 0.002 and 0.023). (5) ELISA showed that 1 day after the intratracheal instillation the IL-4 level BLM, SON, and ASON groups were (20.8 +/- 7.2) ng/L, (21.4 +/- 8.0) ng/L, and (9.7 +/- 1.4) ng/L respectively, all significantly higher than that of the control group [(1.6 +/- 3.6) ng/L, t = 6.494, 4.143, and 4.331, P = 0.003, 0.014, and 0.012], that of the ASON group being significantly lower than those of the BLM and SON groups (t = -3.553 and -3.577, P = 0.024 and 0.023) (6) Correlation analysis showed that 1 day after intratracheal instillation the expression of p65 was positively correlated with IL-4 expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells in the treatment group (r = 0.890, P &lt; 0.05) and the ASON group (r = 0.909, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of NF-kappaB is significantly increased and augments the expression of IL-4 indirectly in the BALF cells during the process of BLM-induced lung fibrosis. ASON significantly inhibits the NF-kappaB activation and the IL-4 expression, and may be useful in gene therapy for pulmonary fibrosis.",M2
17654242,"Effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on delayed chromosomal instability induced by bleomycin in normal human fibroblast cells.This study was carried out to examine the interaction of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) on delayed chromosomal instability by bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>) in human fibroblast cells. A micronucleus-centromere assay using DNA probes for chromosomes 1 and 4 was performed and a 60-Hz ELF-EMF of 0.8 mT field strength was applied either alone or with BLM throughout the culture period. The frequencies of micronuclei (MN) and aneuploidy were analyzed at 28, 88, and 240 h after treatment with BLM. The coexposure of cells to BLM and ELF-EMF led to a significant increase in the frequencies of MN and aneuploidy compared to the cells treated with BLM alone. No difference was observed between field-exposed and sham-exposed control cells. The frequency of MN induced by BLM was increased at 28 h, and further analysis showed a persistent increase up to 240 h, but the new levels were not significantly different from the level at 28 h. BLM increased the frequencies of aneuploidy at 28, 88, and 240 h, and significantly higher frequency of aneuploidy was observed in the cells analyzed at 240 h compared to the cells examined at 28 h. No interaction of ELF-EMF on delayed chromosomal instability by BLM was observed. Our results suggest that ELF-EMF enhances the cytotoxicity of BLM. BLM might induce delayed chromosomal instability, but no effect of ELF-EMF was observed on the BLM-induced delayed chromosomal instability in fibroblast cells.",M2
17537309,"[Relationship between the expression of P-glycoprotein, glutathione S-transferase-pi and thymidylate synthase proteins and adenosine triphosphate tumor chemosensitivity assay in cervical cancer]OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of the adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) in human cervical cancer chemosensitivity testing and to analyze the relationship between the three drug resistance-associated proteins: P-glycoprotein (P-gp); glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi); thymidylate synthase (TS) and ATP-TCA. METHODS: ATP-TCA was used to detect the sensitivity of 35 specimens of fresh cervical cancer to six cytotoxic drugs as follows: paclitaxel (TAX), cisplatin (DDP), bleomycin (<e>BLM</e>), gemcitabine (GEM), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan (CPT-11). Consecutive sections from 35 cases of cervical cancer were assessed immunohistochemically for expression of P-gp, GST-pi and TS proteins. RESULTS: (1) Thirty-two of 35 assays were completed successfully, with an evaluability rate of ATP-TCA at 91% (32/35). There was a marked heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in cervical cancer. The ex vivo sensitive rate of TAX was 88% (28/32), of 5-FU 72% (23/32), of GEM 62% (20/32), of DDP 19% (6/32), of BLM 16% (5/32), and of CPT-11 12% (4/32). (2) The expression of GST-pi and TS protein in cervical cancer was 66% (21/32) and 44% (14/32), which was associated with the resistance to DDP and 5-FU ex vivo (P=0.011, P=0.022), respectively; but the expression of P-gp protein was not associated with any resistance to TAX, 5-FU, GEM, DDP, BLM or CPT-11 ex vivo (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ATP-TCA could be used to individualize chemotherapy by selecting agents for particular patients of cervical cancer. The expression of GST-pi and TS protein might be useful biomarkers to predict the resistance to DDP and 5-FU in patients with cervical cancer.",M2
