20443506,"Computer aided automatic detection of malignant lesions in diffuse optical mammography.PURPOSE: Computer aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) data analysis procedures are introduced and applied to derive composite diffuse optical tomography (DOT) signatures of malignancy in human breast tissue. In contrast to previous optical mammography analysis schemes, the new statistical approach utilizes optical property distributions across multiple subjects and across the many voxels of each subject. The methodology is tested in a population of 35 biopsy-confirmed malignant lesions. METHODS: DOT CAD employs multiparameter, multivoxel, multisubject measurements to derive a simple function that transforms DOT images of tissue chromophores and scattering into a probability of malignancy tomogram. The formalism incorporates both intrasubject spatial heterogeneity and intersubject distributions of physiological properties derived from a population of cancercontaining breasts (the training set). A weighted combination of physiological parameters from the training set define a malignancy parameter (M), with the weighting factors optimized by logistic regression to separate training-set cancer voxels from training-set healthy voxels. The utility of M is examined, employing 3D DOT images from an additional subjects (the test set). RESULTS: Initial results confirm that the automated technique can produce tomograms that distinguish healthy from malignant tissue. When compared to a gold standard tissue segmentation, this protocol produced an average true positive rate (sensitivity) of 89% and a true negative rate (specificity) of 94% using an empirically chosen probability threshold. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the automated multisubject, multivoxel, multiparameter statistical analysis of diffuse optical data is potentially quite useful, producing tomograms that distinguish healthy from malignant tissue. This type of data analysis may also prove useful for suppression of image artifacts.",M1
20443501,"Assessing operating characteristics of <e>CAD</e> algorithms in the absence of a gold standard.PURPOSE: The authors examine potential bias when using a reference reader panel as  gold standard  for estimating operating characteristics of CAD algorithms for detecting lesions. As an alternative, the authors propose latent class analysis (LCA), which does not require an external gold standard to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: A binomial model for multiple reader detections using different diagnostic protocols was constructed, assuming conditional independence of readings given true lesion status. Operating characteristics of all protocols were estimated by maximum likelihood LCA. Reader panel and LCA based estimates were compared using data simulated from the binomial model for a range of operating characteristics. LCA was applied to 36 thin section thoracic computed tomography data sets from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC): Free search markings of four radiologists were compared to markings from four different CAD assisted radiologists. For real data, bootstrap-based resampling methods, which accommodate dependence in reader detections, are proposed to test of hypotheses of differences between detection protocols. RESULTS: In simulation studies, reader panel based sensitivity estimates had an average relative bias (ARB) of -23% to -27%, significantly higher (p-value &lt; 0.0001) than LCA (ARB--2% to -6%). Specificity was well estimated by both reader panel (ARB -0.6% to -0.5%) and LCA (ARB 1.4%-0.5%). Among 1145 lesion candidates LIDC considered, LCA estimated sensitivity of reference readers (55%) was significantly lower (p-value 0.006) than CAD assisted readers' (68%). Average false positives per patient for reference readers (0.95) was not significantly lower (p-value 0.28) than CAD assisted readers' (1.27). CONCLUSIONS: Whereas a gold standard based on a consensus of readers may substantially bias sensitivity estimates, LCA may be a significantly more accurate and consistent means for evaluating diagnostic accuracy.",M1
20443473,"Segmentation and quantification of pulmonary artery for noninvasive CT assessment of sickle cell secondary pulmonary hypertension.PURPOSE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease that results in high mortality and morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. PAH diagnosis is invasive via right heart catheterization, but manual measurements of the main pulmonary artery (PA) diameters from computed tomography (CT) have shown promise as noninvasive surrogate marker of PAH. The authors propose a semiautomated computer-assisted diagnostic (<e>CAD</e>) tool to quantify the main PA size from pulmonary CT angiography (CTA). METHODS: A follow-up retrospective study investigated the potential of CT and image analysis to quantify the presence of PAH secondary to SCD based on PA size. The authors segmented the main pulmonary arteries using a combination of fast marching level sets and geodesic active contours from smoothed pulmonary CTA images of 20 SCD patients with proven PAH by right heart catheterization and 20 matched negative controls. From the PA segmentation, a Euclidean distance map was calculated and an algorithm based on fast marching methods was used to compute subvoxel precise centerlines of the PA trunk (PT) and main left/right PA (PM). Maximum distentions of PT and PM were automatically quantified using the centerline and validated with manual measurements from two observers. RESULTS: The pulmonary trunk and main were significantly larger (p &lt; 0.001) in PAH/SCD patients (33.73 +/- 3.92 mm for PT and 25.17 +/- 2.90 for PM) than controls (27.03 +/- 2.94 mm for PT and 20.62 +/- 3.06 for PM). The discrepancy was qualitatively improved when vessels' diameters were normalized by body surface area (p &lt; 0.001). The validation of the method showed high correlation (mean R=0.9 for PT and R = 0.91 for PM) and Bland-Altman agreement (0.4 +/- 3.6 mm for PT and 0.5 +/- 2.9 mm for PM) between CAD and manual measurements. Quantification errors were comparable to intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD measurements between two different users were robust and reproducible with correlations of R = 0.99 for both PT and PM and Bland-Altman agreements of -0.13 +/- 1.33 mm for PT and -0.08 +/- 0.84 mm for PM. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the semiautomated quantification of pulmonary artery has sufficient accuracy and reproducibility for clinical use. CT with image processing and extraction of PA biomarkers show great potential as a surrogate indicator for diagnosis or quantification of PAH, and could be an important tool for drug discovery and noninvasive clinical surveillance.",M1
20443468,"Increasing computer-aided detection specificity by projection features for CT colonography.PURPOSE: A large number of false positives (FPs) generated by computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) schemes is likely to distract radiologists' attention and decrease their interpretation efficiency. This study aims to develop projection-based features which characterize true and false positives to increase the specificity while maintaining high sensitivity in detecting colonic polyps. METHODS: In this study, two-dimensional projection images are obtained from each initial polyp candidate or volume of interest, and features are extracted from both the gray and color projection images to differentiate FPs from true positives. These projection features were tested to exclude different types of FPs, such as haustral folds, rectal tubes, and residue stool using a database of 325 patient studies (from two different institutions), which includes 556 scans at supine and/or prone positions with 347 polyps and masses sized from 5 to 60 mm. For comparison, several well-established features were used to generate a baseline reference. The experimental evaluation was conducted for large polyps (&gt; or = 10 mm) and medium-sized polyps (5-9 mm) separately. RESULTS: For large polyps, the additional usage of the projection features reduces the FP rate from 5.31 to 1.92 per scan at the comparable by-polyp sensitivity level of 93.1%. For medium-sized polyps, the FP rate is reduced from 8.89 to 5.23 at the sensitivity level of 80.6%. The percentages of FP reduction are 63.9% and 41.2% for the large and medium-sized polyps, respectively, without sacrificing detection sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results have demonstrated that the new projection features can effectively reduce the FPs and increase the detection specificity without sacrificing the sensitivity. CAD of colonic polyps is supposed to help radiologists to improve their performance in interpreting computed tomographic colonography images.",M1
20054985,"Multiclass primal support vector machines for breast density classification.Parenchymal patterns defining the density of breast tissue are detected by advanced correlation pattern recognition in an integrated Computer-Aided Detection (<e>CAD</e>) and diagnosis system. Fractal signatures of density are modelled according to four clinical categories. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the primal formulation solves the multiclass problem using 'One-Versus-All' (OVA) and 'All-Versus-All' (AVA) decompositions, achieving 85% and 94% accuracy, respectively. Fully automated classification of breast density via a texture model derived from fractal dimension, dispersion, and lacunarity moves current qualitative methods forward to objective quantitative measures, amenable with the overarching vision of substantiating the role of density in epidemiological risk models of breast cancer.",M1
20043591,"[Application of computer aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) in clinical imaging. Presentation of the value and current directions in CAD development in various imaging techniques based on literature review]Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is a currently applied computerized analysis of medical images and is widely used as a tool in detection and differential diagnosis of abnormalities in medical imaging. In clinical practice CAD became a very useful implement in various imaging techniques such as mammography, radiography, CT, MRI or diagnostic ultrasound. CAD became also a major research subject in clinical radiology e.g. in detection of pulmonary nodules in chest CT or breast cancer on mammograms. CAD concept, unlike known from 1960s automated computer diagnosis concept (ACD), which is based on computer algorithms only takes into account equally the roles of physician and computer. Current directions in CAD development focus on continuous improvement of overall performance in detection of pathological lesions and assembling CAD schemes as packages implemented as a part of PACS system. The aim of this article is presentation of the concept of computer aided diagnosis, current opportunities of adopting CAD systems into various imaging techniques and new directions in CAD development.",M1
20033597,"Computer-assisted diagnosis of prostate cancer using DCE-MRI data: design, implementation and preliminary results.OBJECTS: We present computer-assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) software designed to improve prostate cancer detection using perfusion MRI data. METHODS: In addition to standard visualization features, this software allows for the 2D and multislice 2D contouring of suspicious areas based on a seeded region growing algorithm, and area labeling based on zonal anatomy. Tumor volume assessment and the semiquantitative analysis of DCE-MRI sequences can both be performed. We retrospectively analyzed DCE-MRI examinations of 100 patients and found 121 lesions showing a suspiciously high intensity with early enhancement in 84 of them. Seventy-one patients turned out to be malignant, whereas 50 were benign. Based on an analysis of the median wash-in and wash-out values of these foci, we designed a standardized 5-level cancer suspicion score (ranging from  probably benign  to  highly suspicious ). This comprehensive score provides a scaled likelihood of malignancy in the region of interest taking account of its location in relation to prostate zonal anatomy. We compared its accuracy with that of visual assessments of time-intensity curves performed by specialist and non-specialist radiologists. RESULTS: Parameters of the scoring algorithm were designed to provide the greatest possible sensitivity in our sample population. A re-substitution evaluation provided an Se/Sp of 100/45% for peripheral zone cancer, and 100/40% for transition zone cancer characterization. When identifying malignant areas using time-intensity curves data, this simple algorithm performed significantly better (AUC = 0.77) than a non-specialist (AUC = 0.57, P &lt; 0.0001) radiologist, and better than a trained (AUC = 0.70) radiologist, although this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Our new prostate MRI CAD software provides a standardized cancer suspicion score for suspicious foci detected in DCE-MRI T1-w images. Our results suggest that it may improve radiologists' performances in prostate cancer identification, especially when they are not specialized in prostate imaging.",M1
20033580,"Computer-aided detection of breast carcinoma in standard mammographic projections with digital mammography.PURPOSE: A retrospective evaluation of the ability of computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) ability to identify breast carcinoma in standard mammographic projections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five biopsy proven lesions in 44 patients imaged digitally with CAD applied at examination were reviewed. Forty-four screening BIRADS category 1 digital mammography examinations were randomly identified to serve as a comparative normal/control population. Data included patient age; BIRADS breast density; lesion type, size, and visibility; number, type, and location of CAD marks per image; CAD ability to mark lesions; needle core and surgical pathologic correlation. RESULTS: The CAD lesion/case sensitivity of 87% (n = 39), image sensitivity of 69% (n = 31) for mediolateral oblique view and 78% (n = 35) for the craniocaudal view was found. The average false positive rate in 44 normal screening cases was 2.0 (range 1-8). The 2.0 figure is based on 88 reported false positive CAD marks in 44 normal screening exams: 98% (n = 44) lesions proceeded to excision; initial pathology upgraded at surgical excision from in situ to invasive disease in 24% (n = 9) lesions. CONCLUSION: CAD demonstrated potential to detect mammographically visible cancers in standard projections for all lesion types.",M1
20033579,"Integration of computer-aided diagnosis/detection (<e>CAD</e>) results in a PACS environment using CAD-PACS toolkit and DICOM SR.PURPOSE: Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) is a mature technology in health care delivery for daily clinical imaging service and data management. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) utilizes computer methods to obtain quantitative measurements from medical images and clinical information to assist clinicians to assess a patient's clinical state more objectively. CAD needs image input and related information from PACS to improve its accuracy; and PACS benefits from CAD results online and available at the PACS workstation as a second reader to assist physicians in the decision making process. Currently, these two technologies remain as two separate independent systems with only minimal system integration. This paper describes a universal method to integrate CAD results with PACS in its daily clinical environment. METHODS: The method is based on Health Level 7 (HL7) and Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards, and Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) workflow profiles. In addition, the integration method is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant. SUMMARY: The paper presents (1) the clinical value and advantages of integrating CAD results in a PACS environment, (2) DICOM Structured Reporting formats and some important IHE workflow profiles utilized in the system integration, (3) the methodology using the CAD-PACS integration toolkit, and (4) clinical examples with step-by-step workflows of this integration.",M1
20033498,"Computer-aided diagnosis of lumbar disc pathology from clinical lower spine MRI.PURPOSE: Detection of abnormal discs from clinical T2-weighted MR Images. This aids the radiologist as well as subsequent <e>CAD</e> methods in focusing only on abnormal discs for further diagnosis. Furthermore, it gives a degree of confidence about the abnormality of the intervertebral discs that helps the radiologist in making his decision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a probabilistic classifier for the detection of abnormality of intervertebral discs. We use three features to label abnormal discs that include appearance, location, and context. We model the abnormal disc appearance with a Gaussian model, the location with a 2D Gaussian model, and the context with a Gaussian model for the distance between abnormal discs. We infer on the middle slice of the T2-weighted MRI volume for each case. These MRI scans are specific for the lumbar area. We obtain our gold standard for the ground truth from our collaborating radiologist group by having the clinical diagnosis report for each case. RESULTS: We achieve over 91% abnormality detection accuracy in a cross-validation experiment with 80 clinical cases. The experiment runs ten rounds; in each round, we randomly leave 30 cases out for testing and we use the other 50 cases for training. CONCLUSION: We achieve high accuracy for detection of abnormal discs using our proposed model that incorporates disc appearance, location, and context. We show the extendability of our proposed model to subsequent diagnosis tasks specific to each intervertebral disc abnormality such as desiccation and herniation.",M1
19965015,"Texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis for fiberscopic images.Flexible endoscopes based on fiber bundles are still widely used despite the recent success of so-called tipchip endoscopes. This is partly due to the costs and that for extremely thin diameters (below 3 mm) there are still only fiberscopes available. Due to the inevitable artifacts caused by the transition from the fiber bundles to the sensor chip, image and texture analysis algorithms are severely handicapped. Therefore, texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems could not be used in such domains without image preprocessing. We describe a CAD system approach that includes an image filtering algorithm to remove the fiber image artifacts first and then applies conventional color texture algorithms that have been applied to other endoscopic disciplines in the past. The concept is evaluated on an image database with artificially rendered fiber artifacts so that ground truth information is available.",M1
19965010,"A public image database to support research in computer aided diagnosis.The Public Lung Database to address drug response (PLD) has been developed to support research in computer aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>). Originally established for applications involving the characterization of pulmonary nodules, the PLD has been augmented to provide initial datasets for CAD research of other diseases. In general, the best performance for a CAD system is achieved when it is trained with a large amount of well documented data. Such training databases are very expensive to create and their lack of general availability limits the targets that can be considered for CAD applications and hampers development of the CAD field. The approach taken with the PLD has been to make available small datasets together with both manual and automated documentation. Furthermore, datasets with special properties are provided either to span the range of task complexity or to provide small change repeat images for direct calibration and evaluation of CAD systems. This resource offers a starting point for other research groups wishing to pursue CAD research in new directions. It also provides an on-line reference for better defining the issues relating to specific CAD tasks.",M1

HeartCycle is a European project that aims to improve life quality of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and heart failure (HF) patients. Within this project, the Medical Risk Assessment module is responsible for develop models to assess cardiovascular (CV) risk and status of referred patients. The present work was performed under the context of CV status models, where myocardial ischemia plays a central role.

A sensitivity of 96.7% and a positive predictivity of 96.2% reveal the capacity of the proposed strategy to perform ischemic episodes identification.",M1
19964707,"Automated classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes using scale invariant feature transform.The task of analyzing tissue biopsies performed by a pathologist is challenging and time consuming. It suffers from intra- and inter-user variability. Computer assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) helps to reduce such variations and speed up the diagnostic process. In this paper, we propose an automatic computer assisted diagnostic system for renal cell carcinoma subtype classification using scale invariant features. We capture the morphological distinctness of various subtypes and we have used them to classify a heterogeneous data set of renal cell carcinoma biopsy images. Our technique does not require color segmentation and minimizes human intervention. We circumvent user subjectivity using automated analysis and cater for intra-class heterogeneities using multiple class templates. We achieve a classification accuracy of 83% using a Bayesian classifier.",M1
19963750,"Automatic fundus image classification for computer-aided diagonsis.With the advances of computer technology, more and more computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems have been developed to provide the  second opinion . This paper reports an automatic fundus image classification technique that is designed to screen out the severely degraded fundus images that cannot be processed by traditional CAD systems. The proposed technique classifies fundus images based on the image range property. In particular, it first calculates a number of range images from a fundus image at different resolutions. A feature vector is then constructed based on the histogram of the calculated range images. Finally, fundus images can be classified by a linear discriminant classifier that is built by learning from a large number of normal and abnormal training fundus images. Experiments over 644 fundus images of different qualities show that the classification accuracy of the proposed technique reaches above 96%.",M1
19913125,"Can breast MRI computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) improve radiologist accuracy for lesions detected at MRI screening and recommended for biopsy in a high-risk population?AIM: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) computer-aided detection (CAD) for breast MRI screen-detected lesions recommended for biopsy in a high-risk population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3-5 lesions with histopathological correlation [nine invasive cancers, 13 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 34 benign] were retrospectively evaluated using a breast MRI CAD prototype (CAD-Gaea). CAD evaluation was performed separately and in consensus by two radiologists specializing in breast imaging, blinded to the histopathology. Thresholds of 50, 80, and 100% and delayed enhancement were independently assessed with CAD. Lesions were rated as malignant or benign according to threshold and delayed enhancement only and in combination. Sensitivities, specificities, and negative predictive values (NPV) were determined for CAD assessments versus pathology. Initial MRI BI-RADS interpretation without CAD versus CAD assessments were compared using paired binary diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Threshold levels for lesion enhancement were: 50% to include all malignant (and all benign) lesions; and 100% for all invasive cancer and high-grade DCIS. Combined use of threshold and enhancement patterns for CAD assessment was best (73% sensitivity, 56% specificity and 76% NPV for all cancer). Sensitivities and NPV were better for invasive cancer (100%/100%) than for all malignancies (54%/76%). Radiologists' MRI interpretation was more sensitive than CAD (p=0.05), but less specific (p=0.001) for cancer detection. CONCLUSION: The breast MRI CAD system used could not improve the radiologists' accuracy for distinguishing all malignant from benign lesions, due to the poor sensitivity for DCIS detection.",M1
19906311,"Computer-aided assessment of diagnostic images for epidemiological research.BACKGROUND: Diagnostic images are often assessed for clinical outcomes using subjective methods, which are limited by the skill of the reviewer. Computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) algorithms that assist reviewers in their decisions concerning outcomes have been developed to increase sensitivity and specificity in the clinical setting. However, these systems have not been well utilized in research settings to improve the measurement of clinical endpoints. Reductions in bias through their use could have important implications for etiologic research. METHODS: Using the example of cortical cataract detection, we developed an algorithm for assisting a reviewer in evaluating digital images for the presence and severity of lesions. Available image processing and statistical methods that were easily implementable were used as the basis for the CAD algorithm. The performance of the system was compared to the subjective assessment of five reviewers using 60 simulated images. Cortical cataract severity scores from 0 to 16 were assigned to the images by the reviewers and the CAD system, with each image assessed twice to obtain a measure of variability. Image characteristics that affected reviewer bias were also assessed by systematically varying the appearance of the simulated images. RESULTS: The algorithm yielded severity scores with smaller bias on images where cataract severity was mild to moderate (approximately &lt;or= 6/16ths). On high severity images, the bias of the CAD system exceeded that of the reviewers. The variability of the CAD system was zero on repeated images but ranged from 0.48 to 1.22 for the reviewers. The direction and magnitude of the bias exhibited by the reviewers was a function of the number of cataract opacities, the shape and the contrast of the lesions in the simulated images. CONCLUSION: CAD systems are feasible to implement with available software and can be valuable when medical images contain exposure or outcome information for etiologic research. Our results indicate that such systems have the potential to decrease bias and discriminate very small changes in disease severity. Simulated images are a tool that can be used to assess performance of a CAD system when a gold standard is not available.",M1
19884071,"Automated detection and segmentation of large lesions in CT colonography.Computerized tomographic colonography is a minimally invasive technique for the detection of colorectal polyps and carcinoma. Computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) schemes are designed to help radiologists locating colorectal lesions in an efficient and accurate manner. Large lesions are often initially detected as multiple small objects, due to which such lesions may be missed or misclassified by CAD systems. We propose a novel method for automated detection and segmentation of all large lesions, i.e., large polyps as well as carcinoma. Our detection algorithm is incorporated in a classical CAD system. Candidate detection comprises preselection based on a local measure for protrusion and clustering based on geodesic distance. The generated clusters are further segmented and analyzed. The segmentation algorithm is a thresholding operation in which the threshold is adaptively selected. The segmentation provides a size measurement that is used to compute the likelihood of a cluster to be a large lesion. The large lesion detection algorithm was evaluated on data from 35 patients having 41 large lesions (19 of which malignant) confirmed by optical colonoscopy. At five false positive (FP) per scan, the classical system achieved a sensitivity of 78%, while the system augmented with the large lesion detector achieved 83% sensitivity. For malignant lesions, the performance at five FP/scan was increased from 79% to 95%. The good results on malignant lesions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm may provide relevant additional information for the clinical decision process.",M1
19864511,"Breast US computer-aided diagnosis system: robustness across urban populations in South Korea and the United States.PURPOSE: To evaluate the robustness of a breast ultrasonographic (US) computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system in terms of its performance across different patient populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three US databases were analyzed for this study: one South Korean and two United States databases. All three databases were utilized in an institutional review board-approved and HIPAA-compliant manner. Round-robin analysis and independent testing were performed to evaluate the performance of a computerized breast cancer classification scheme across the databases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate performance differences. RESULTS: The round-robin analyses of each database demonstrated similar results, with areas under the ROC curve ranging from 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.820, 0.918) to 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95). The independent testing of each database, however, indicated that although the performances were similar, the range in areas under the ROC curve (from 0.79 [95% CI: 0.730, 0.842] to 0.87 [95% CI: 0.794, 0.923]) was wider than that with the round-robin tests. However, the only instances in which statistically significant differences in performance were demonstrated occurred when the Korean database was used in a testing capacity in independent testing. CONCLUSION: The few observed statistically significant differences in performance indicated that while the US features used by the system were useful across the databases, their relative importance differed. In practice, this means that a CAD system may need to be adjusted when applied to a different population.",M1
19863409,"Computer-aided detection in digital mammography: false-positive marks and their reproducibility in negative mammograms.BACKGROUND: There are relatively few studies reporting the frequency of false-positive computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) marks and their reproducibility in normal cases. PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively the false-positive mark rate of a CAD system and the reproducibility of false-positive marks in two sets of negative digital mammograms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two sets of negative digital mammograms were obtained in 360 women (mean age 57 years, range 30-76 years) with an approximate interval of 1 year (mean time 343.7 days), and a CAD system was applied. False-positive CAD marks and the reproducibility were determined. RESULTS: Of the 360 patients, 252 (70.0%) and 240 (66.7%) patients had 1-7 CAD marks on the initial and second mammograms, respectively. The false-positive CAD mark rate was 1.5 (1.1 for masses and 0.4 for calcifications) and 1.4 (1.0 for masses and 0.4 for calcifications) per examination in the initial and second mammograms, respectively. The reproducibility of the false-positive CAD marks was 12.0% for both mass (81/680) and microcalcification (33/278) marks. CONCLUSION: False-positive CAD marks were seen in approximately 70% of normal cases. However, the reproducibility was very low. Radiologists must be familiar with the findings of false-positive CAD marks, since they are very common and can increase the recall rate in screening.",M1
19859858,"Computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) and assessment of malignant lesions in the liver and lung using a novel PET/CT software tool: initial results.PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of a PET/CT software tool (PET computer-aided detection: PET-CAD) for automated detection and assessment of pulmonary and hepatic lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases and 20 consecutive patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were examined with FDG-PET/CT. In a first step the maximum standardized uptake values (SUV (max)) of non-tumorous liver and lung tissues were determined manually. This value was used as a threshold value for software-based lesion detection. The number of lesions detected, their SUV (max), and their sizes in the x, y, and z-planes, as automatically provided by PET-CAD, were compared to visual lesion detection and manual measurements on CT. RESULTS: The sensitivity for automated detection was 96 % (86 - 99 %) for colorectal liver metastases and 90 % (70 - 99 %) for lung lesions. The positive predictive value was 80 % for liver and 68 % for lung lesions. The mean SUV (max) of all lung lesions was 9.3 and 8.8 for the liver lesions. When assessed by PET-CAD, the mean lesion sizes for liver lesions in the x, y, and z-planes were 4.3 cm, 4.6 cm, and 4.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm, 3.8 cm, and 3.6 cm for manual measurements. The mean lesion sizes of lung lesions were 7.4 cm, 7.7 cm, and 8.4 cm in the x, y, and z-planes when assessed by PET-CAD compared to 5.8 cm, 6.1 cm, and 7.1 cm when measured manually. Using manual assessment, the lesion sizes were significantly smaller in all planes (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSION: Software tools for automated lesion detection and assessment are expected to improve the clinical PET/CT workflow. Before implementation in the clinical routine, further improvements to the measurement accuracy are required.",M1
19810465,"A hierarchical spectral clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction scheme for detection of prostate cancer from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been shown to have great clinical potential as a supplement to magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer (CaP). MRS provides functional information in the form of changes in the relative concentration of specific metabolites including choline, creatine, and citrate which can be used to identify potential areas of CaP. With a view to assisting radiologists in interpretation and analysis of MRS data, some researchers have begun to develop computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) schemes for CaP identification from spectroscopy. Most of these schemes have been centered on identifying and integrating the area under metabolite peaks which is then used to compute relative metabolite ratios. However, manual identification of metabolite peaks on the MR spectra, and especially via CAD, is a challenging problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio, baseline irregularity, peak overlap, and peak distortion. In this article the authors present a novel CAD scheme that integrates nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) with an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to automatically identify suspicious regions on the prostate using MRS and hence avoids the need to explicitly identify metabolite peaks. The methodology comprises two stages. In stage 1, a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm is used to distinguish between extracapsular and prostatic spectra in order to localize the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the prostate. Once the prostate ROI is localized, in stage 2, a NLDR scheme, in conjunction with a replicated clustering algorithm, is used to automatically discriminate between three classes of spectra (normal appearing, suspicious appearing, and indeterminate). The methodology was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on a total of 18 1.5 T in vivo prostate T2-weighted (w) and MRS studies obtained from the multisite, multi-institutional American College of Radiology (ACRIN) trial. In the absence of the precise ground truth for CaP extent on the MR imaging for most of the ACRIN studies, probabilistic quantitative metrics were defined based on partial knowledge on the quadrant location and size of the tumor. The scheme, when evaluated against this partial ground truth, was found to have a CaP detection sensitivity of 89.33% and specificity of 79.79%. The results obtained from randomized threefold and fivefold cross validation suggest that the NLDR based clustering scheme has a higher CaP detection accuracy compared to such commonly used MRS analysis schemes as z score and PCA. In addition, the scheme was found to be robust to changes in system parameters. For 6 of the 18 studies an expert radiologist laboriously labeled each of the individual spectra according to a five point scale, with 1/2 representing spectra that the expert considered normal and 3/4/5 being spectra the expert deemed suspicious. When evaluated on these expert annotated datasets, the CAD system yielded an average sensitivity (cluster corresponding to suspicious spectra being identified as the CaP class) and specificity of 81.39% and 64.71%, respectively.",M1
19789221,"Polyp characteristics correctly annotated by computer-aided detection software but ignored by reporting radiologists during CT colonography.PURPOSE: To retrospectively describe the characteristics of polyps incorrectly dismissed by radiologists despite appropriate computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) prompting during computed tomographic (CT) colonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and patient informed consent were obtained from institutions that provided the data sets used in this HIPAA-compliant study. A total of 111 polyps that had a diameter of at least 6 mm and were detected with CAD were collated from three previous studies in which researchers investigated radiologist performance with and without CAD (total, 25 readers). Two new observers graded each polyp with predefined criteria, including polyp size, morphology, and location; data set quality; ease of visualization; tagging use and polyp coating; colonic curvature; CAD mark obscuration; and number of false-positive findings. The 86 polyps that were missed before CAD (those that were unreported by one or more original readers) were divided into those that remained unreported after CAD (no CAD gain, n = 36) and those that were reported correctly by at least one additional reader (CAD gain, n = 50). Logistic-regression analysis and the Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the results of both groups with each other and with a control group of 25 polyps, all of which were detected by readers without CAD. RESULTS: Before CAD, polyps 10 mm in diameter or larger, those that were rated easy to visualize, and those that were uncoated by tagged fluid were less likely to be missed (72%, 76%, and 80% of control polyps vs 43%, 43%, and 59% of missed polyps, respectively; P &lt; .001, P &lt; .01, and P &lt; .03, respectively). After CAD, the odds of CAD gain decreased with increasing polyp size (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 1.00; P = .04) and irregular morphology (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.92; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Larger irregular polyps are a common source of incorrect radiologist dismissal, despite correct CAD prompting.",M1
19787727,"Algorithm-based method for detection of blood vessels in breast MRI for development of computer-aided diagnosis.PURPOSE: To develop a computer-based algorithm for detecting blood vessels that appear in breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to evaluate the improvement in reducing the number of vascular pixels that are labeled by computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems as being suspicious of malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was performed in 34 cases. The algorithm applied a filter bank based on wavelet transform and the Hessian matrix to detect linear structures as blood vessels on a two-dimensional maximum intensity projection (MIP). The vessels running perpendicular to the MIP plane were then detected based on the connectivity of enhanced pixels above a threshold. The nonvessel enhancements were determined and excluded based on their morphological properties, including those showing scattered small segment enhancements or nodular or planar clusters. The detected vessels were first converted to a vasculature skeleton by thinning and subsequently compared to the vascular track manually drawn by a radiologist. RESULTS: When evaluating the performance of the algorithm in identifying vascular tissue, the correct-detection rate refers to pixels identified by both the algorithm and radiologist, while the incorrect-detection rate refers to pixels identified by only the algorithm, and the missed-detection rate refers to pixels identified only by the radiologist. From 34 analyzed cases the median correct-detection rate was 85.6% (mean 84.9% +/- 7.8%), the incorrect-detection rate was 13.1% (mean 15.1% +/- 7.8%), and the missed-detection rate was 19.2% (mean 21.3% +/- 12.8%). When detected vessels were excluded in the hot-spot color-coding of the CAD system, they could reduce the labeling of vascular vessels in 2.6%-68.6% of hot-spot pixels (mean 16.6% +/- 15.9%). CONCLUSION: The computer algorithm-based method can detect most large vessels and provide an effective means in reducing the labeling of vascular pixels as suspicious on a DCE-MRI CAD system. This algorithm may improve the workflow of radiologists using CAD for image display, but will be particularly useful for development of automated CAD that gives diagnostic impression.",M1
19721831,"Comparative analysis of logistic regression, support vector machine and artificial neural network for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant solid breast tumors by the use of three-dimensional power Doppler imaging.OBJECTIVE: Logistic regression analysis (LRA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a neural network (NN) are commonly used statistical models in computer-aided diagnostic (<e>CAD</e>) systems for breast ultrasonography (US). The aim of this study was to clarify the diagnostic ability of the use of these statistical models for future applications of CAD systems, such as three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler imaging, vascularity evaluation and the differentiation of a solid mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database that contained 3D power Doppler imaging pairs of non-harmonic and tissue harmonic images for 97 benign and 86 malignant solid tumors was utilized. The virtual organ computer-aided analysis-imaging program was used to analyze the stored volumes of the 183 solid breast tumors. LRA, an SVM and NN were employed in comparative analyses for the characterization of benign and malignant solid breast masses from the database. RESULTS: The values of area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, referred to as Az values for the use of non-harmonic 3D power Doppler US with LRA, SVM and NN were 0.9341, 0.9185 and 0.9086, respectively. The Az values for the use of harmonic 3D power Doppler US with LRA, SVM and NN were 0.9286, 0.8979 and 0.9009, respectively. The Az values of six ROC curves for the use of LRA, SVM and NN for non-harmonic or harmonic 3D power Doppler imaging were similar. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performances of these three models (LRA, SVM and NN) are not different as demonstrated by ROC curve analysis. Depending on user emphasis for the use of ROC curve findings, the use of LRA appears to provide better sensitivity as compared to the other statistical models.",M1
19701842,"Dynamic MRI and <e>CAD</e> vs. choline MRS: where is the detection level for a lesion characterisation in prostate cancer?PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of pre-interventional fused high resolution T2-weighted images with parametrically analysed dynamic contrast enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images (DCE-MRI) and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for a precise biopsy for the detection of prostate cancer and for the delineation of intraprostatic subvolumes for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria: Pathological prostate-specific antigen values (PSA) and/or previously negative transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. Standardised biopsy of the prostate divided into 20 regions. Image fusion of coloured parametric maps derived from DCE-MRI and MRS (single voxel spectroscopy, SVS; chemical shift imaging, CSI) with T2 images for morphological localisation using the MR-workstation, a separate CAD-workstation (CAD: computer aided diagnosis) or a radiation treatment planning system. Correlation of these intraprostatic subvolumes with histology and cytokeratin-positive areas in prostatectomy species. RESULTS: DCE-MRI: Sensitivity 82%, specificity 89%, accuracy 88%, positive predictive value 61%, negative predictive value 96%. SVS: Sensitivity 55%, specificity 62%. CSI: Sensitivity 68%, specificity 67%. False positive findings due to prostatitis, adenomatous hyperplasia, false negative findings due to low signal (PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), cut-off level for DCE-MRI: lesions smaller 3 mm and less than 30% cancer cells, for SVS: lesions smaller 8 mm and less than 50% cancer cells), for CSI: lesions smaller 4 mm and less than 40% cancer cells. Our MR data are correlated with published choline PET/CT data (PET/CT: hybrid scanner of positron emission tomography and computed tomography). CONCLUSIONS: DCE-MRI and MRS are helpful for a precise biopsy of the prostate. The European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) guidelines 2006 for radiation treatment planning of the prostate have to be revised, if the standardised biopsy will be replaced by a lesion-orientated biopsy. Until now it is unclear, if the parametric maps of DCE-MRI and MRS can be used for radiation treatment planning of the prostate.",M1
19697693,"Performance evaluation of computer aided diagnostic tool (<e>CAD</e>) for detection of ultrasonic based liver disease.Recent advances in digital imaging technology have greatly enhanced the interpretation of critical/pathology conditions from the 2-dimensional medical images. This has become realistic due to the existence of the computer aided diagnostic tool. A computer aided diagnostic (CAD) tool generally possesses components like preprocessing, identification/selection of region of interest, extraction of typical features and finally an efficient classification system. This paper enumerates on development of CAD tool for classification of chronic liver disease through the 2-D image acquired from ultrasonic device. Characterization of tissue through qualitative treatment leads to the detection of abnormality which is not viable through qualitative visual inspection by the radiologist. Common liver diseases are the indicators of changes in tissue elasticity. One can show the detection of normal, fatty or malignant condition based on the application of CAD tool thereby, further investigation required by radiologist can be avoided. The proposed work involves an optimal block analysis (64 x 64) of the liver image of actual size 256 x 256 by incorporating Gabor wavelet transform which does the texture classification through automated mode. Statistical features such as gray level mean as well as variance values are estimated after this preprocessing mode. A non-linear back propagation neural network (BPNN) is applied for classifying the normal (vs) fatty and normal (vs) malignant liver which yields a classification accuracy of 96.8%. Further multi classification is also performed and a classification accuracy of 94% is obtained. It can be concluded that the proposed CAD can be used as an expert system to aid the automated diagnosis of liver diseases.",M1
19673208,"Computer-aided diagnosis of pulmonary nodules on CT scans: improvement of classification performance with nodule surface features.The purpose of this work is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system to differentiate malignant and benign lung nodules on CT scans. A fully automated system was designed to segment the nodule from its surrounding structured background in a local volume of interest (VOI) and to extract image features for classification. Image segmentation was performed with a 3D active contour method. The initial contour was obtained as the boundary of a binary object generated by k-means clustering within the VOI and smoothed by morphological opening. A data set of 256 lung nodules (124 malignant and 132 benign) from 152 patients was used in this study. In addition to morphological and texture features, the authors designed new nodule surface features to characterize the lung nodule surface smoothness and shape irregularity. The effects of two demographic features, age and gender, as adjunct to the image features were also investigated. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier built with features from stepwise feature selection was trained using simplex optimization to select the most effective features. A two-loop leave-one-out resampling scheme was developed to reduce the optimistic bias in estimating the test performance of the CAD system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, A(z), for the test cases improved significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from 0.821 +/- 0.026 to 0.857 +/- 0.023 when the newly developed image features were included with the original morphological and texture features. A similar experiment performed on the data set restricted to primary cancers and benign nodules, excluding the metastatic cancers, also resulted in an improved test A(z), though the improvement did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). The two demographic features did not significantly affect the performance of the CAD system (p &gt; 0.05) when they were added to the feature space containing the morphological, texture, and new gradient field and radius features. To investigate if a support vector machine (SVM) classifier can achieve improved performance over the LDA classifier, we compared the performance of the LDA and SVMs with various kernels and parameters. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space for both the LDA and the SVM classifiers. When the number of selected principal components was varied, the highest test A(z) among the SVMs of various kernels and parameters was slightly higher than that of the LDA in one-loop leave-one-case-out resampling. However, no SVM with fixed architecture consistently performed better than the LDA in the range of principal components selected. This study demonstrated that the authors' proposed segmentation and feature extraction techniques are promising for classifying lung nodules on CT images.",M1
19673196,"An adaptive incremental approach to constructing ensemble classifiers: application in an information-theoretic computer-aided decision system for detection of masses in mammograms.Ensemble classifiers have been shown efficient in multiple applications. In this article, the authors explore the effectiveness of ensemble classifiers in a case-based computer-aided diagnosis system for detection of masses in mammograms. They evaluate two general ways of constructing subclassifiers by resampling of the available development dataset: Random division and random selection. Furthermore, they discuss the problem of selecting the ensemble size and propose two adaptive incremental techniques that automatically select the size for the problem at hand. All the techniques are evaluated with respect to a previously proposed information-theoretic <e>CAD</e> system (IT-CAD). The experimental results show that the examined ensemble techniques provide a statistically significant improvement (AUC = 0.905 +/- 0.024) in performance as compared to the original IT-CAD system (AUC = 0.865 +/- 0.029). Some of the techniques allow for a notable reduction in the total number of examples stored in the case base (to 1.3% of the original size), which, in turn, results in lower storage requirements and a shorter response time of the system. Among the methods examined in this article, the two proposed adaptive techniques are by far the most effective for this purpose. Furthermore, the authors provide some discussion and guidance for choosing the ensemble parameters.",M1
19672861,"Strategies for digital mammography interpretation in a clinical patient population.Mammography is the basic imaging modality for early detection of breast cancer. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of different mammogram reading strategies on the diagnostic yield in a consecutive patient population referred for digital mammography to a hospital. First, the effect of using computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) software on the performance of mammogram readers was studied. Furthermore, the impact of employing technologists as either prereaders or double readers was assessed, as compared to the conventional strategy of single reading by a radiologist. Digital mammograms of 1,048 consecutive patients were evaluated by a radiologist and 3 technologists with and without the use of CAD software. ROC analysis was used to study the effects of the different strategies. In the conventional strategy, an overall area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 was found, corresponding to a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 94%. When applying CAD software, the AUCs were similar before and after CAD for all readers (mean of 0.95). Employing technologists in prereading and double reading of mammograms resulted in a mean AUC of 0.91 and 0.96, respectively. In the prereading strategy, the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 81 and 96%; in the double reading strategy they were 96 and 79%, respectively. Concluding, in this clinical population, systematic application of CAD software by either radiologist or technologists failed to improve the diagnostic yield. Furthermore, employing technologists as double readers of mammograms was the most effective strategy in improving breast cancer detection in daily clinical practice.",M1

19661736,"Computer-aided diagnosis in breast tomosynthesis and chest CT.Computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>), in the general sense, includes computer-aided detection and characterization of abnormalities on medical images. The usefulness of CAD for assisting radiologists in detection of breast cancer in screening mammography has been demonstrated by a number of prospective clinical trials in recent years. The development of CAD in other areas is also being actively pursued by researchers. In this talk, the recent work in two areas of CAD, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and chest computed tomography (CT), in the CAD Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan will be reviewed. DBT is a new modality under development for breast imaging. The quasi-3D information in DBT alleviates the problem of overlapping tissue in mammography and holds the promise to improve the sensitivity for cancer detection. DBT image analysis can be performed in the 3D reconstructed volume of the 2D projection view (PV) images. DBT image quality depend on the image acquisition parameters, reconstruction method and parameters. The flexibility in image processing approaches makes CAD development for DBT interesting and challenging. out early experiences in the development of image segmentation and features extraction technique for mass detection and characterization in DBT will be discussed. The performances of the CAD systems using the 2D, 3D, and combined 2D and 3D approaches will be compared. CT has been shown to be superior to chest x-ray in detection of small lung nodules and thus lung cancer screening with CT is still being debated, many research groups are developing CAD methods for detection and characterization of lung nodules in chest CT scans. The specific prescreening, segmentation, and feature extraction techniques designed for our lung nodule detection and characterization systems will be discussed. The effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in nodules detection and characterization in CT scans will be demonstrated by results of observer ROC studies. There are similarities in the approaches to developing CAD methods in 3D image volumes such as DBT and CT, these experiences will facilitate the development of CAD systems for other diseases in 3D modalities.",M1
19620442,"An anthropomorphic phantom study of computer-aided detection performance for polyp detection on CT colonography: a comparison of commercially and academically available systems.OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the diagnostic performances of two commercial computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) systems and a CAD system developed in our laboratory, which we refer to as an  academic CAD system,  for polyp detection on CT colonography (CTC) and to assess the detection characteristics of the CAD systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred three polyps (48 polyps &lt; 6 mm and 55 polyps &gt; or = 6 mm; 45 sessile, 33 flat, and 25 pedunculated polyps) were created. Each CTC data set was analyzed using two commercial CAD systems (Computer Assisted Reader [CAR] and Polyp Enhanced View [PEV]) and one Hessian matrix-based academic CAD system. Per-polyp sensitivities according to polyp size and shape were compared among the three CAD systems. The average number and causes of false-positives (FPs) were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Per-polyp sensitivity for all polyps was significantly better for the academic CAD system (83.5%) than for both commercial CAD systems (64.1%) (p &lt; 0.01). However, the difference in per-polyp sensitivity for polyps &gt; or = 6 mm was not significant (p &gt; 0.017). According to morphology, per-polyp sensitivities as determined with the CAR, PEV, and academic CAD systems for flat, sessile, and pedunculated polyps were 51.5%, 57.6%, and 81.8%; 60.0%, 62.2%, and 84.4%; 88.0%, 76.0%, and 84.0%, respectively. The average number of FPs was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05); however, the distribution of the causes of FPs for the three systems was significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: For polyps &gt; or = 6 mm, the three CAD systems showed comparable per-polyp sensitivities. Although the number of FPs was not significantly different, the distribution of the causes of FPs for each of the CAD systems was significantly different.",M1
19615468,"Symmetry and asymmetry analysis and its implications to computer-aided diagnosis: A review of the literature.Although clinicians have long sought to integrate computer-aided diagnostic (<e>CAD</e>) systems into routine clinical practice, it has proven to be extremely difficult to perform fully automated algorithmic analyses on lesions, based solely on the information contained in images. To increase the utility of computerized tools, it would be intuitive to incorporate anatomical and pathological knowledge and heuristics to help the system draw diagnostic inferences. In neuro-imaging applications, for example, one way to perform this knowledge integration is to uncover symmetry/asymmetry information from the corresponding regions of the head and to explore its implication to positive clinical findings. To correctly quantify asymmetric patterns in brain images, however, the symmetry axis, or the symmetry plane, needs to be appropriately oriented in space; i.e., the symmetry plane needs to be correctly identified either manually or using computerized methods. This review will provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of both symmetry axis/plane detection, and asymmetry quantification in neuro-images.",M1
19562230,"Computer-assisted diagnosis for precancerous lesions in the esophagus.OBJECTIVES: The interpretation of endoscopic findings by gastroenterologists is still a difficult and highly subjective task. Despite important developments such as chromo-endoscopy, pit pattern analysis, fluorescence imaging as well as narrow band imaging it still requires lots of experience and training with a certain tentativeness until the final biopsy. By the development of computer-assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems this process can be supported. METHODS: This paper presents a new approach to CAD for precancerous lesions in the esophagus based on color-texture analysis in a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) framework. The novelty of our approach lies in the combination of newly developed color-texture features with the interactive feedback loop provided by a relevance feedback algorithm. This allows the expert to steer the query and is still robust against accidental false decisions. RESULTS: We reached an inter-rater reliability of kappa = 0.71 on a database of 390 endoscopic images. The retrieval accuracy didn't change significantly until a wrong decision rate of 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the system could be able to support practitioners with less experience or in private practice. In combination with a connected case database it can also support case-based reasoning for the diagnostic decision process.",M1
19536726,"Computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection - performance of two <e>CAD</e> systems at different CT dose levels.PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets. RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",M1
19527950,"Shape-based computer-aided detection of lung nodules in thoracic CT images.In this paper, a new computer tomography (CT) lung nodule computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) method is proposed for detecting both solid nodules and ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules (part solid and nonsolid). This method consists of several steps. First, the lung region is segmented from the CT data using a fuzzy thresholding method. Then, the volumetric shape index map, which is based on local Gaussian and mean curvatures, and the  dot  map, which is based on the eigenvalues of a Hessian matrix, are calculated for each voxel within the lungs to enhance objects of a specific shape with high spherical elements (such as nodule objects). The combination of the shape index (local shape information) and  dot  features (local intensity dispersion information) provides a good structure descriptor for the initial nodule candidates generation. Antigeometric diffusion, which diffuses across the image edges, is used as a preprocessing step. The smoothness of image edges enables the accurate calculation of voxel-based geometric features. Adaptive thresholding and modified expectation-maximization methods are employed to segment potential nodule objects. Rule-based filtering is first used to remove easily dismissible nonnodule objects. This is followed by a weighted support vector machine (SVM) classification to further reduce the number of false positive (FP) objects. The proposed method has been trained and validated on a clinical dataset of 108 thoracic CT scans using a wide range of tube dose levels that contain 220 nodules (185 solid nodules and 35 GGO nodules) determined by a ground truth reading process. The data were randomly split into training and testing datasets. The experimental results using the independent dataset indicate an average detection rate of 90.2%, with approximately 8.2 FP/scan. Some challenging nodules such as nonspherical nodules and low-contrast part-solid and nonsolid nodules were identified, while most tissues such as blood vessels were excluded. The method's high detection rate, fast computation, and applicability to different imaging conditions and nodule types shows much promise for clinical applications.",M1
19507676,"Correlations among acoustic, texture and morphological features for breast ultrasound <e>CAD</e>.Acoustic, textural and morphological features of the breast in ultrasound imaging were extracted for computer-aided diagnosis. In addition, correlations among different categories of features were analyzed. Clinical data from 14 patients (7 malignant and 7 benign samples) were acquired. A custom-made experimental apparatus was used for simultaneous data acquisition of B-mode ultrasound and limited-angle tomography images. Textural features were extracted from B-mode images, including five parameters derived from the gray-level concurrence matrix and five parameters derived from a nonseparable wavelet transform. Morphological features were also extracted from B-mode images, including the depth-to-width ratio and normalized radial gradient. Acoustic features were estimated using limited-angle tomography, including the sound velocity and attenuation coefficient. Generally, the correlation coefficients for features within the textural feature group were relatively high (0.48-0.79), whereas those between different feature categories were relatively low (0.17-0.40). This suggests that combining different sets of features would improve the computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cyclopus was tested on a set of 120 mammograms on which the two compared commercial systems had been previously tested. The set consisted of mammograms reported as negative, preceding 31 interval cancers reviewed as screening error or minimal sign, and of 89 verified negative controls randomly selected from the same screening database. RESULTS: Cyclopus sensitivity was 74.1% (R2=54.8%; CADx=41.9%) and was higher for interval cancers reviewed as screening error (90.9%; R2=54.5%; CADx=81.8%) compared with those reviewed as minimal sign (65.0%; R2=55.0%; CADx=20.0%). Specificity was 15.7% (R2=29.2%; CADx=17.9%). Overall accuracy was 30.8% (R2=35.8%; CADx=24.1%). The positive predictive value of a case with CAD marks [regions of interest (ROI)] was 23.4% (23/98; R2=16.0%; CADx=15.1%). Average ROI number per view among negative controls was 1.13 (R2=0.93; CADx=0.99). Cyclopus was more sensitive for masses compared with isolated microcalcifications (208 vs 62 ROI; R2=90 vs 213; CADx=192 vs 130).

A Food-and-Drug-Administration-approved CAD program (version 1.0; Riverain Medical) was applied to 34 chest radiographs with a  radiologist-missed  nodular cancer and 36 radiographs with a radiologist-mentioned nodule (a newer version 3.0 was also applied to the 36-case database). The marks applied by this CAD system consisted of 5-cm-diameter circles. A strict  nodule-in-center  criterion and a generous  nodule-in-circle  criterion were compared as methods for the calculation of CAD sensitivity. The increased sensitivities by the nodule-in-circle criterion were considered as nodules detected by chance. The number of false-positive (FP) marks was also analyzed. For the 34 radiologist-missed cancers, the nodule-in-circle criterion caused eight more cancers (24%) to be detected by chance, as compared to the nodule-in-center criterion, when using the version 1.0 results. For the 36 radiologist-mentioned nodules, the nodule-in-circle criterion caused seven more lesions (19%) to be detected by chance, as compared to the nodule-in-center criterion, when using the version 1.0 results, and three more lesions (8%) to be detected by chance when using the version 3.0 results. Version 1.0 yielded a mean of six FP marks per image, while version 3.0 yielded only three FP marks per image. The specific criteria used to define true- and false-positive CAD detections can substantially influence the apparent accuracy of a CAD system.",M1
19409753,"Computer-aided diagnosis of peripheral soft tissue masses based on ultrasound imaging.Medical ultrasound (US) has been widely used for distinguishing benign from malignant peripheral soft tissue tumors. However, diagnosis by US is subjective and depends on the experience of the radiologists. The rarity of peripheral soft tissue tumors can make them easily neglected and this frequently leads to delayed diagnosis, which results in a much higher death rate than with other tumors. In this paper, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system to diagnose peripheral soft tissue masses on US images. We retrospectively evaluated 49 cases of pathologically proven peripheral soft tissue masses (32 benign, 17 malignant). The proposed CAD system includes three main procedures: image pre-processing and region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, feature extraction and statistics-based discriminant analysis (DA). We developed a depth-normalization factor (DNF) to compensate for the influence of the depth setting on the apparent size of the ROI. After image pre-processing and normalization, five features, namely area (A), boundary transition ratio (T), circularity (C), high intensity spots (H) and uniformity (U), were extracted from the US images. A DA function was then employed to analyze these features. A CAD algorithm was then devised for differentiating benign from malignant masses. The CAD system achieved an accuracy of 87.8%, a sensitivity of 88.2%, a specificity of 87.5%, a positive predictive value (PPV) 78.9% and a negative predictive value (NPV) 93.3%. These results indicate that the CAD system is valuable as a means of providing a second diagnostic opinion when radiologists carry out peripheral soft tissue mass diagnosis.",M1
19373538,"Computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer: definition and detection of ground-glass opacity type of nodules by high-resolution computed tomography.PURPOSE: The ground-glass opacity (GGO) of lung cancer is identified only subjectively on computed tomography (CT) images as no quantitative characteristic has been defined for GGOs. We sought to define GGOs quantitatively and to differentiate between GGOs and solid-type lung cancers semiautomatically with a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>). METHODS AND MATERIALS: High-resolution CT images of 100 pulmonary nodules (all peripheral lung cancers) were collected from our clinical records. Two radiologists traced the contours of nodules and distinguished GGOs from solid areas. The CT attenuation value of each area was measured. Differentiation between cancer types was assessed by a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The mean CT attenuation of the GGO areas was -618.4 +/- 212.2 HU, whereas that of solid areas was -68.1 +/- 230.3 HU. CAD differentiated between solidand GGO-type lung cancers with a sensitivity of 86.0% and specificity of 96.5% when the threshold value was -370 HU. Four nodules of mixed GGOs were incorrectly classified as the solid type. CAD detected 96.3% of GGO areas when the threshold between GGO and solid areas was 194 HU. CONCLUSION: Objective definition of GGO area by CT attenuation is feasible. This method is useful for semiautomatic differentiation between GGOs and solid types of lung cancer.",M1
19291970,"Computer-aided mass detection in mammography: false positive reduction via gray-scale invariant ranklet texture features.In this work, gray-scale invariant ranklet texture features are proposed for false positive reduction (FPR) in computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) of breast masses. Two main considerations are at the basis of this proposal. First, false positive (FP) marks surviving our previous CAD system seem to be characterized by specific texture properties that can be used to discriminate them from masses. Second, our previous CAD system achieves invariance to linear/nonlinear monotonic gray-scale transformations by encoding regions of interest into ranklet images through the ranklet transform, an image transformation similar to the wavelet transform, yet dealing with pixels' ranks rather than with their gray-scale values. Therefore, the new FPR approach proposed herein defines a set of texture features which are calculated directly from the ranklet images corresponding to the regions of interest surviving our previous CAD system, hence, ranklet texture features; then, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used for discrimination. As a result of this approach, texture-based information is used to discriminate FP marks surviving our previous CAD system; at the same time, invariance to linear/nonlinear monotonic gray-scale transformations of the new CAD system is guaranteed, as ranklet texture features are calculated from ranklet images that have this property themselves by construction. To emphasize the gray-scale invariance of both the previous and new CAD systems, training and testing are carried out without any in-between parameters' adjustment on mammograms having different gray-scale dynamics; in particular, training is carried out on analog digitized mammograms taken from a publicly available digital database, whereas testing is performed on full-field digital mammograms taken from an in-house database. Free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve analysis of the two CAD systems demonstrates that the new approach achieves a higher reduction of FP marks when compared to the previous one. Specifically, at 60%, 65%, and 70% per-mammogram sensitivity, the new CAD system achieves 0.50, 0.68, and 0.92 FP marks per mammogram, whereas at 70%, 75%, and 80% per-case sensitivity it achieves 0.37, 0.48, and 0.71 FP marks per mammogram, respectively. Conversely, at the same sensitivities, the previous CAD system reached 0.71, 0.87, and 1.15 FP marks per mammogram, and 0.57, 0.73, and 0.92 FPs per mammogram. Also, statistical significance of the difference between the two per-mammogram and per-case FROC curves is demonstrated by the p-value &lt; 0.001 returned by jackknife FROC analysis performed on the two CAD systems.",M1
19237341,"An automatic computer-aided detection system for meniscal tears on magnetic resonance images.Knee-related injuries including meniscal tears are common in both young athletes and the aging population, and require accurate diagnosis and surgical intervention when appropriate. With proper techniques and radiologists' experienced skills, confidence in detection of meniscal tears can be quite high. This paper develops a novel computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) diagnostic system for automatic detection of meniscal tears in the knee. Evaluation of this CAD system using an archived database of images from 40 individuals with suspected knee injuries indicates that the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed CAD system are 83.87% and 75.19%, respectively, compared to the mean sensitivity and specificity of 77.41% and 81.39%, respectively, obtained by experienced radiologists in routine diagnosis without using the CAD. The experimental results suggest that the developed CAD system has great potential and promise in automatic detection of both simple and complex meniscal tears of the knee.",M1
19223423,"Improved classifications of planar whole-body bone scans using a computer-assisted diagnosis system: a multicenter, multiple-reader, multiple-case study.The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate whether a computer-assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system could improve performance and reduce interobserver variation in bone-scan interpretations of the presence or absence of bone metastases. METHODS: The whole-body bone scans (anterior and posterior views) of 59 patients with breast or prostate cancer who had undergone scintigraphy for suspected bone metastatic disease were studied. The patients were selected to reflect the spectrum of pathology found in everyday clinical work. Thirty-five physicians working at 18 of the 30 nuclear medicine departments in Sweden agreed to participate. The physicians were asked to classify each case for the presence or absence of bone metastasis, without (baseline) and with the aid of the CAD system (1 y later), using a 4-point scale. The final clinical assessments, based on follow-up scans and other clinical data including the results of laboratory tests and available diagnostic images (such as MRI, CT, and radiographs from a mean follow-up period of 4.8 y), were used as the gold standard. Each physician's classification was pairwise compared with the classifications made by all the other physicians, resulting in 595 pairs of comparisons, both at baseline and after using the CAD system. RESULTS: The physicians increased their sensitivity from 78% without to 88% with the aid of the CAD system (P &lt; 0.001). The specificity did not change significantly with CAD. Percentage agreement and kappa-values between paired physicians on average increased from 64% to 70% and from 0.48 to 0.55, respectively, with the CAD system. CONCLUSION: A CAD system improved physicians' sensitivity in detecting metastases and reduced interobserver variation in planar whole-body bone scans. The CAD system appears to have significant potential in assisting physicians in their clinical routine.",M1
19188317,"Impact of computer-aided detection on the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography.PURPOSE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of adding computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) to a computed tomographic (CT) colonography screening program and to compare it with other options of colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of screening strategies by using CT colonography with and without CAD, flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), and optical colonoscopy were compared by using a Markov-based computer model. In the model, a hypothetical population of 100,000 persons aged 50 years underwent colorectal screening every 10 years. Baseline sensitivities for both experienced and inexperienced readers and the incremental accuracy when adding CAD were estimated from a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: At baseline, the addition of CAD resulted in 9% and 2% increases in CRC prevention rates for inexperienced and experienced readers, respectively, when compared with CT colonography without CAD. Assuming a CAD cost of $50 per CT colonography, the overall program costs increased by only 3%-5%, largely because of the substantial reduction in CRC-related costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness of CT colonography with CAD compared with CT colonography without CAD was $8661 and $61,354 per life-year gained for inexperienced and experienced readers, respectively. Optical colonoscopy was not a cost-effective alternative to CT colonography with CAD performed by experienced readers, with an incremental cost-effectiveness of $498,668 per life-year gained. CT colonography with CAD for inexperienced readers was more clinically effective and cost-effective than FS. At analysis, sensitivity of CT colonography with CAD for polyps 6 mm or larger was the most meaningful variable. CONCLUSION: The addition of CAD to CT colonography screening improves the CRC prevention rate, resulting in advantageous cost-effectiveness for screening.

19175137,"Anniversary paper: History and status of <e>CAD</e> and quantitative image analysis: the role of Medical Physics and AAPM.The roles of physicists in medical imaging have expanded over the years, from the study of imaging systems (sources and detectors) and dose to the assessment of image quality and perception, the development of image processing techniques, and the development of image analysis methods to assist in detection and diagnosis. The latter is a natural extension of medical physicists' goals in developing imaging techniques to help physicians acquire diagnostic information and improve clinical decisions. Studies indicate that radiologists do not detect all abnormalities on images that are visible on retrospective review, and they do not always correctly characterize abnormalities that are found. Since the 1950s, the potential use of computers had been considered for analysis of radiographic abnormalities. In the mid-1980s, however, medical physicists and radiologists began major research efforts for computer-aided detection or computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), that is, using the computer output as an aid to radiologists-as opposed to a completely automatic computer interpretation-focusing initially on methods for the detection of lesions on chest radiographs and mammograms. Since then, extensive investigations of computerized image analysis for detection or diagnosis of abnormalities in a variety of 2D and 3D medical images have been conducted. The growth of CAD over the past 20 years has been tremendous-from the early days of time-consuming film digitization and CPU-intensive computations on a limited number of cases to its current status in which developed CAD approaches are evaluated rigorously on large clinically relevant databases. CAD research by medical physicists includes many aspects-collecting relevant normal and pathological cases; developing computer algorithms appropriate for the medical interpretation task including those for segmentation, feature extraction, and classifier design; developing methodology for assessing CAD performance; validating the algorithms using appropriate cases to measure performance and robustness; conducting observer studies with which to evaluate radiologists in the diagnostic task without and with the use of the computer aid; and ultimately assessing performance with a clinical trial. Medical physicists also have an important role in quantitative imaging, by validating the quantitative integrity of scanners and developing imaging techniques, and image analysis tools that extract quantitative data in a more accurate and automated fashion. As imaging systems become more complex and the need for better quantitative information from images grows, the future includes the combined research efforts from physicists working in CAD with those working on quantitative imaging systems to readily yield information on morphology, function, molecular structure, and more-from animal imaging research to clinical patient care. A historical review of CAD and a discussion of challenges for the future are presented here, along with the extension to quantitative image analysis.",M1
19175123,"Scale-based scatter correction for computer-aided polyp detection in CT colonography.CT colonography (CTC) is a feasible and minimally invasive method for the detection of colorectal polyps and cancer screening. Computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) of polyps can improve consistency and sensitivity of virtual colonoscopy interpretation and reduce interpretation burden. However, high-density orally administered contrast agents have scatter effects on neighboring tissues. The scattering manifests itself as an artificial elevation in the observed CT attenuation values of the neighboring tissues. This pseudoenhancement phenomenon presents a problem for the application of computer-aided polyp detection, especially when polyps are submerged in the contrast agents. The authors have developed a scale-based correction method that minimizes scatter effects in CTC data by subtraction of the estimated scatter components from observed CT attenuations. By bringing a locally adaptive structure, object scale, into the correction framework, the region of neighboring tissues affected by contrast agents is automatically specified and adaptively changed in different parts of the image. The method was developed as one preprocessing step in the authors' CAD system and was tested by using leave-one-patient-out evaluation on 56 clinical CTC scans (supine or prone) from 28 patients. There were 50 colonoscopy-confirmed polyps measuring 6-9 mm. Visual evaluation indicated that the method reduced CT attenuation of pseudoenhanced polyps to the usual polyp Hounsfield unit range without affecting luminal air regions. For polyps submerged in contrast agents, the sensitivity of CAD with correction is increased 24% at a rate of ten false-positive detections per scan. For all polyps within 6-9 mm, the sensitivity of the authors' CAD with scatter correction is increased 8% at a rate of ten false-positive detections per scan. The authors' results indicated that CAD with this correction method as a preprocessing step can yield a high sensitivity and a relatively low FP rate in CTC.",M1
19175108,"Correlative feature analysis on FFDM.Identifying the corresponding images of a lesion in different views is an essential step in improving the diagnostic ability of both radiologists and computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems. Because of the nonrigidity of the breasts and the 2D projective property of mammograms, this task is not trivial. In this pilot study, we present a computerized framework that differentiates between corresponding images of the same lesion in different views and noncorresponding images, i.e., images of different lesions. A dual-stage segmentation method, which employs an initial radial gradient index (RGI) based segmentation and an active contour model, is applied to extract mass lesions from the surrounding parenchyma. Then various lesion features are automatically extracted from each of the two views of each lesion to quantify the characteristics of density, size, texture and the neighborhood of the lesion, as well as its distance to the nipple. A two-step scheme is employed to estimate the probability that the two lesion images from different mammographic views are of the same physical lesion. In the first step, a correspondence metric for each pairwise feature is estimated by a Bayesian artificial neural network (BANN). Then, these pairwise correspondence metrics are combined using another BANN to yield an overall probability of correspondence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the individual features and the selected feature subset in the task of distinguishing corresponding pairs from noncorresponding pairs. Using a FFDM database with 123 corresponding image pairs and 82 noncorresponding pairs, the distance feature yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.81 +/- 0.02 with leave-one-out (by physical lesion) evaluation, and the feature metric subset, which included distance, gradient texture, and ROI-based correlation, yielded an AUC of 0.87 +/- 0.02. The improvement by using multiple feature metrics was statistically significant compared to single feature performance.",M1
19175088,"Texture classification-based segmentation of lung affected by interstitial pneumonia in high-resolution CT.Accurate and automated lung field (LF) segmentation in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is highly challenged by the presence of pathologies affecting lung borders, also affecting the performance of computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) schemes. In this work, a two-dimensional LF segmentation algorithm adapted to interstitial pneumonia (IP) patterns is presented. The algorithm employs k-means clustering followed by a filling operation to obtain an initial LF order estimate. The final LF border is obtained by an iterative support vector machine neighborhood labeling of border pixels based on gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics features. A second feature set based on gray level averaging and gradient features was also investigated to evaluate its effect on segmentation performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of 22 HRCT cases spanning a range of IP patterns such as ground glass, reticular, and honeycombing. The accuracy of the method is assessed using area overlap and shape differentiation metrics (d(mean), d(rms), and d(max)), by comparing automatically derived lung borders to manually traced ones, and further compared to a gray level thresholding-based (GLT-based) method. Accuracy of the methods evaluated is also compared to interobserver variability. The proposed method incorporating gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics demonstrated the highest segmentation accuracy, averaged over left and right LFs (overlap=0.954, d(mean)=1.080 mm, d(rms)=1.407 mm, and d(max)=4.944 mm), which is statistically significant (two-tailed student's t test for paired data, p&lt;0.0083) with respect to all metrics considered as compared to the proposed method incorporating gray level averaging and gradient features (overlap=0.918, d(mean)=2.354 mm, d(rms)=3.711 mm, and d(max)=14.412 mm) and the GLT-based method (overlap=0.897, d(mean)=3.618 mm, d(rms)=5.007 mm, and d(max)=16.893 mm). The performance of the three segmentation methods, although decreased as IP pattern severity level (mild, moderate, and severe) was increased, did not demonstrate statistically significant difference (two-tailed student's t test for unpaired data, p&gt;0.0167 for all metrics considered). Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method, based on gray level and wavelet coefficient statistics ranges within interobserver variability. The proposed segmentation method could be used as an initial stage of a CAD scheme for IP patterns.",M1

19171521,"Aggregation of classifiers for staining pattern recognition in antinuclear autoantibodies analysis.Indirect immunofluorescence is currently the recommended method for the detection of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA). The diagnosis consists of both estimating the fluorescence intensity and reporting the staining pattern for positive wells only. Since resources and adequately trained personnel are not always available for these tasks, an evident medical demand is the development of computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) tools that can support the physician decisions. In this paper, we present a system that classifies the staining pattern of positive wells on the strength of the recognition of their cells. The core of the CAD is a multiple expert system (MES) based on the one-per-class approach devised to label the pattern of single cells. It employs a hybrid approach since each composing binary module is constituted by an ensemble of classifiers combined by a fusion rule. Each expert uses a set of stable and effective features selected from a wide pool of statistical and spectral measurements. In this framework, we present a novel parameter that measures the reliability of the final classification provided by the MES. This feature is used to introduce a reject option that allows to reduce the error rate in the recognition of the staining pattern of the whole well. The approach has been evaluated on 37 wells, for a total of 573 cells. The measured performance shows a low overall error rate ( 2.7%-5.8%), which is below the observed intralaboratory variability.",M1
19163841,"Assessment of computerized analysis algorithms for one dimension physiologic data with multiple databases.Software technology enables computerized analysis to offer second opinion in various screening and diagnostic tasks to assist the clinicians. Yet, the performance of these computerized methods for medical images is questioned by experts in <e>CAD</e> research, owing to the use of different databases and criteria for evaluating the computer results for comparison. This paper intends to substantiate this statement by illustrating the effects of such issues with the use of 1D physiologic data and multiple databases. For this purpose, the detection of desaturation events in Sp02 and spike events in EEG are used. This is the first time that comparison between different algorithms on a common basis is carried out on an individual effort. The appraisal for all the algorithms is made on the same databases and criteria. It is surprising to find that issues for 2/3D images concur with those found in 1D data here. In evaluating the accuracy of a new algorithm, a single independent database gives results fast. This paper reveals weaknesses of such an approach. It is hoped that the supportive evidence shown here is enough for researchers to innovate a better platform for credibility in reporting performance comparison of computerized analysis algorithms.",M1

19163567,"Computer-aided diagnosis scheme for classification of lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces in brain MR images.The detection of asymptomatic lacunar infarcts on magnetic resonance (MR) images is important because their presence indicates an increased risk of severe cerebral infarction. However, accurate identification of lacunar infarcts on MR images is often hard for radiologists because of the difficulty in distinguishing lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Therefore, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) scheme for the classification of lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Our database consisted of T1- and T2- weighted images obtained from 109 patients. The locations of lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were determined by an experienced neuroradiologist. It included 89 lacunar infarcts and 20 enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. We first enhanced the lesions in T2-weighted image by using the white top-hat transformation. A gray-level thresholding was then applied to the enhanced image for the segmentation of lesions. From the segmented lesions, we determined image features, such as size, shape, location, and signal intensities in T1- and T2- weighted images. A neural network was then employed for distinguishing between lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Our computerized method was evaluated by using a leave-one-out method. The result indicated that the area under the ROC curve was 0.945. Therefore, our CAD scheme would be useful in assisting radiologists for diagnosis of silent cerebral infarctions in MR images.",M1
19163336,"<e>CAD</e> of colon cancer on CT colonography cases without cathartic bowel preparation.Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems must show sufficient versatility to produce robust analysis on a large variety of data. In the case of colonography, CAD has not been designed to cope with the presence of stool, although labeling the stool with high contrast agents replaces the use of laxatives and reduces the patient discomfort. This procedure introduces additional challenges for the diagnosis, such as poorly tagged stool, stool sticking to colonic walls, and heterogeneous stool (tagged stool mixed with air or untagged stool). Our study proposes a robust algorithm for heterogeneous stool removal to be employed as a preprocessing module for CAD systems in colonic cancer detection. Colonoscopy data are automatically cleansed of residual stool to enhance the polyp appearance for improved diagnosis. The algorithm uses expectation-maximization, quadratic regression, level sets and minimum variance. Results show stool removal accuracy on polyps which are partially or fully covered by stool. The results are robust on stool lining and large pools of heterogeneous and weakly-tagged stool. The automatic detection of colon polyps using our CAD system on cathartic-free data improves considerably with the addition of the automatic stool removal module from 74% to 86% true positive (TP) rate at 6.4 false positives (FP)/case.",M1

19020477,"A novel algorithm for initial lesion detection in ultrasound breast images.This paper proposes a novel approach to initial lesion detection in ultrasound breast images. The objective is to automate the manual process of region of interest (ROI) labeling in computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>). We propose the use of hybrid filtering, multifractal processing, and thresholding segmentation in initial lesion detection and automated ROI labeling. We used 360 ultrasound breast images to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Images were preprocessed using histogram equalization before hybrid filtering and multifractal analysis were conducted. Subsequently, thresholding segmentation was applied on the image. Finally, the initial lesions are detected using a rule-based approach. The accuracy of the automated ROI labeling was measured as an overlap of 0.4 with the lesion outline as compared with lesions labeled by an expert radiologist. We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of three state-of-the-art methods, namely, the radial gradient index filtering technique, the local mean technique, and the fractal dimension technique. We conclude that the proposed method is more accurate and performs more effectively than do the benchmark algorithms considered.",M1

A comparison between two systems and three observers with different levels of experience]PURPOSE: The value of computer-assisted detection (<e>CAD</e>) used in magnetic resonance (MR) mammography in a clinical setting is currently a subject of controversy. This study evaluated the extent to which color-coded CAD systems aid radiologists with different levels of experience in their reading of MR mammographies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 48 patients with a total of 88 lesions (43 malignant, 45 benign) were included. All examinations were performed on a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner with intravenous application of 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine/kg body weight. Three readers independently analyzed the images without knowledge of the clinical data; radiologists 1 and 2 were much more experienced in the interpretation of MR mammographies than radiologist 3. Initially, the observers visually categorized the lesions as benign or malignant following classification of BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System). The readers also scored their own confidence level using a dichotome score (1: unsure vs. 2: sure) according to the BI-RADS classification. The images were then analyzed in a blinded manner with two technically different CAD systems: the full-time point (FTP) method (Cadsciences; White Plains, NY, USA) and the Dynacad version 1.1 (Invivo; Pewaukee, WI, USA). RESULTS: After CAD, all three readers classified more malignant lesions as BI-RADS 4 or 5 (suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy). However, this increase in sensitivity revealed only statistical significance for observer 3 (p &lt; 0.05). After CAD, the two experienced readers categorized about the same quantity of benign lesions correctly as BI-RADS 2. Observer 3 classified less benign lesions as BI-RADS 2 after both CAD analyses; i. e. the specificity decreased. The subjective confidence of all observers increased after analysis with Dynacad. Observer 3 also reported to be more confident after the FTP method. CONCLUSION: Computer-assisted detection can be a useful additional diagnostic tool for the radiologist in the interpretation of MR mammographies, but does not have the potential to replace the professional experience of a radiologist.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with SPNs were analyzed. After the pre-contrast scan was performed, an additional ten series of post-contrast images were obtained at 20-second intervals. Two investigators measured the attenuation values of the SPNs: a radiologist who drew the regions of interest (ROIs), and a technician who used a CAD system. The Bland and Altman plots were used to compare the net enhancement between a CAD system and direct personal drawing. The diagnostic characteristics of the malignant SPNs were calculated by considering the CAD and direct personal drawing and with using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: On the Bland and Altman plot, the net enhancement difference between the CAD system and direct personal drawing was not significant (within +/- 2 standard deriation). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of diagnosing malignant SPNs using CAD was 92%, 85%, 75%, 96% and 88%, respectively.

METHODS: Local research ethics committee approval was obtained; informed consent was not required. Mammograms were obtained from women attending routine mammography at two breast screening centres in 1996. Films, previously double read, were re-read by a different reader using CAD. The study material included 315 cancer cases comprising all screen-detected cancer cases, all subsequent interval cancers and 861 normal cases randomly selected from 10,267 cases. Ground truth data were used to assess the efficacy of CAD prompting. Associations between prompt attributes and tumour features or reader recall decisions were assessed by chi-squared tests. RESULTS: There was a highly significant relationship between prompting and a decision to recall for cancer cases and for a random sample of normal cases (P &lt; 0.001). Sixty-four per cent of all cases contained at least one CAD prompt. In cancer cases, larger prompts were more likely to be recalled (P = 0.02) for masses but there was no such association for calcifications (P = 0.9). In a random sample of 861 normal cases, larger prompts were more likely to be recalled (P = 0.02) for both mass and calcification prompts. Significant associations were observed with prompting and breast density (p = 0.009) for cancer cases but not for normal cases (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For both normal cases and cancer cases, prompted mammograms were more likely to be recalled and the prompt size was also associated with a recall decision.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty computed tomographic scans were evaluated. Database included 23 lung cancers (long diameter &lt;20 mm), nodules stable for at least 2 years, and normal cases. Five chest radiologists and 5 radiology residents each independently recorded the locus of each nodule candidate and assigned a confidence score for the likelihood of nodule and malignancy without CAD; then, the interpretation was repeated with the use of CAD. A consensus panel of 2 chest radiologists served as a reference standard for the nodules. Histological confirmation was a reference standard for the cancers. The performances of the observers for the detection of nodules and cancer with and without CAD were compared using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The performance of detecting lung nodules was increased significantly with CAD for all radiologists and subgroups (P &lt; 0.01). Although the overall performance of detecting lung cancers was not affected significantly with the use of CAD (P &gt; 0.05), 4 lung cancers missed by 3 residents on their initial observation were additionally detected with CAD. Eighteen of 23 lung cancers were detected by CAD itself. CONCLUSIONS: The overall radiologists' performance of detecting lung nodules was improved significantly with the use of CAD, whereas no statistical significance was observed for the detection of lung cancers. The use of CAD, however, contributed to the detection of additional lung cancers for less experienced readers.",M1
18606749,"A computer-aided diagnosis system to screen for osteoporosis using dental panoramic radiographs.OBJECTIVES: An eroded inferior cortex of the mandible detected on dental panoramic radiographs is useful for identifying post-menopausal women with low skeletal bone mineral density (BMD) or osteoporosis. The purposes of this study were to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system that automatically determines cortical erosion of the mandible on dental panoramic radiographs and to assess the validation of this CAD system. METHODS: A CAD system was developed based on mathematical morphology for identifying post-menopausal women with low skeletal BMD or osteoporosis, based on World Health Organization criteria, by identifying whether the endosteal margin of mandibular cortical bone was eroded. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, accuracy and likelihood for a positive risk result were calculated using dichotomous 2 x 2 tables using 100 panoramic radiographs. RESULTS: For identifying women with low skeletal BMD, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.8% and 61.1%, respectively, the positive and negative predictive values were 90.0% and 36.7%, accuracy was 74.0% and the likelihood for positive risk was 1.96. The respective values for identifying women with osteoporosis were 94.4% and 43.8%, the positive and negative predictive values were 48.6% and 93.3%, respectively, the accuracy was 62.0% and the likelihood for positive risk was 1.68. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a CAD system applied to dental panoramic radiographs may be useful for identifying post-menopausal women with low skeletal BMD or osteoporosis.",M1
18574139,"Breast US computer-aided diagnosis workstation: performance with a large clinical diagnostic population.PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) workstation in classifying cancer in a realistic data set representative of a clinical diagnostic breast ultrasonography (US) practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The database consisted of consecutive diagnostic breast US scans collected with informed consent with a protocol approved by the institutional review board and compliant with the HIPAA. Images from 508 patients with a total of 1046 distinct abnormalities were used. One hundred one patients had breast cancer. Results both for patients in whom the lesion abnormality was proved with either biopsy or aspiration (n = 183) and for all patients irrespective of biopsy status (n = 508) are presented. The ability of the CAD workstation to help differentiate malignancies from benign lesions was evaluated with a leave-one-out-by-case analysis. The clinical specificity of the radiologists for this dataset was determined according to the biopsy rate and outcome. RESULTS: In the task of differentiating cancer from all other lesions sent to biopsy, the CAD workstation obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.88, with 100% sensitivity at 26% specificity (157 cancers and 362 lesions total). The radiologists' specificity at 100% sensitivity for this set was zero. When analyzing all lesions irrespective of biopsy status, which is more representative of actual clinical practice, the CAD scheme obtained an AUC of 0.90 and 100% sensitivity at 30% specificity (157 cancers and 1046 lesions total). The radiologists' specificity at 100% sensitivity for this set was 77%. CONCLUSION: Current levels of computer performance warrant a clinical evaluation of the potential of US CAD to aid radiologists in lesion work-up recommendations.",M1
18572123,"Ultrasound breast tumor image computer-aided diagnosis with texture and morphological features.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) systems based on shape analysis have been proved to be highly accurate in evaluating breast tumors. However, it takes considerable time to train the classifier and diagnose breast tumors, because extracting morphologic features require a lot of computation. Hence, to develop a highly accurate and quick CAD system, we combined the texture and morphologic features of ultrasound breast tumor imaging to evaluate breast tumors in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated 210 ultrasound breast tumor images, including 120 benign tumors and 90 malignant tumors. The breast tumors were segmented automatically by the level set method. The autocovariance texture features and solidity morphologic feature were extracted, and a support vector machine was used to identify the tumor as benign or malignant. RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed diagnostic system for classifying breast tumors was 92.86%, the sensitivity was 94.44%, the specificity was 91.67%, the positive predictive value was 89.47%, and the negative predictive value was 95.65%. In addition, the proposed system reduced the training time compared to systems based only on the morphologic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The CAD system based on texture and morphologic analysis can differentiate benign from malignant breast tumors with high accuracy and short training time. It is therefore clinically useful to reduce the number of biopsies of benign lesions and offer a second reading to assist inexperienced physicians in avoiding misdiagnosis.",M1
18561648,"Computer-aided diagnosis for the classification of focal liver lesions by use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.The authors developed a computer-aided diagnostic (<e>CAD</e>) scheme for classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) as liver metastasis, hemangioma, and three histologic differentiation types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by use of microflow imaging (MFI) of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. One hundred and three FLLs obtained from 97 cases used in this study consisted of 26 metastases (15 hyper- and 11 hypovascularity types), 16 hemangiomas (five hyper- and 11 hypovascularity types) and 61 HCCs: 24 well differentiated (w-HCC), 28 moderately differentiated (m-HCC), and nine poorly differentiated (p-HCC). Pathologies of all cases were determined based on biopsy or surgical specimens. Locations and contours of FLLs on contrast-enhanced images were determined manually by an experienced physician. MFI was obtained with contrast-enhanced low-mechanical-index (MI) pulse subtraction imaging at a fixed plane which included a distinctive cross section of the FLL. In MFI, the inflow high signals in the plane, which were due to the vascular patterns and the contrast agent, were accumulated following flash scanning with a high-MI ultrasound exposure. In the initial step of our computerized scheme, a series of the MFI images was extracted from the original cine clip (AVI format). We applied a smoothing filter and time-sequential running average techniques in order to reduce signal noise on the single MFI image and cyclic noise on the sequential MFI images, respectively. A kidney, vessels, and a liver parenchyma region were segmented automatically by use of the last image of a series of MFI images. The authors estimated time-intensity curves for an FLL by use of a series of the temporally averaged MFI images in order to determine temporal features such as estimated replenishment times at early and delayed phases, flow rates, and peak times. In addition, they extracted morphologic and gray-level image features which were determined based on the physicians' knowledge of the diagnosis of the FLL, such as the size of lesion, vascular patterns, and the presence of hypoechoic regions. They employed a cascade of six independent artificial neural networks (ANNs) by use of extracted temporal and image features for classifying five types of liver diseases. A total of 16 temporal and image features, which were selected from 43 initially extracted features, were used for six different ANNs for making decisions at each decision in the cascade. The ANNs were trained and tested with a leave-one-lesion-out test method. The classification accuracies for the 103 FLLs were 88.5% for metastasis, 93.8% for hemangioma, and 86.9% for all HCCs. In addition, the classification accuracies for histologic differentiation types of HCCs were 79.2% for w-HCC, 50.0% for m-HCC, and 77.8% for p-HCC. The CAD scheme for classifying FLLs by use of the MFI on contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy in the histologic diagnosis of HCCs and the other liver diseases.",M1
18520568,"Computer-aided diagnosis of the airways: beyond nodule detection.Although to date, the major impetus for the development of computer-assisted diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) has been the detection of pulmonary nodules, CAD should properly be viewed as a potential tool for assisting radiologic interpretation of the entire gamut of chest diseases, including not just enhanced detection of disease but also characterization and quantification, ideally leading to improved patient management. The use of CAD to improve visualization of the airways using advanced computer techniques, including sophisticated methods for obtaining 3-dimensional segmentation of the central airways and, in particular, the development of virtual bronchoscopy has been recently studied. In this paper, the authors review the development of a specific series of CAD applications enabling automated identification and characterization of chronically inflamed airways. The advantages to the use of computer methodologies to quantify peripheral airway disease include reproducible visualization methods to display the location, severity, and extent of airway dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, and the presence of mucoid impacted airways. Currently, a number of semiquantitative global scoring systems have been proposed to assess disease extent and severity in patients with bronchiectasis. Unfortunately, with the exception of patients with cystic fibrosis, these are rarely if ever employed, largely owing to the considerable inconvenience of measuring individual airway dimensions and computing a global score. It is apparent that for this specific purpose, CAD may be ideally suited. Automated staging allows for more complete assessment of the entire bronchial tree while providing improved standardization and eliminating an otherwise tedious and time-consuming task.",M1

18514362,"Computer-aided diagnosis: the emerging of three <e>CAD</e> systems induced by Japanese health care needs.The aim of this paper is to describe three emerging computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems induced by Japanese health care needs. CAD has been developing fast in the last two decades. The idea of using a computer to help in medical image diagnosis is not new. Some pioneer studies are dated back to the 1960s. In 1998, the first U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved commercial CAD system, a film-digitized mammography system, was launched by R2 Technologies, Inc. The success was quickly repeated by a number of companies. The approval of Medicare CAD reimbursement in the U.S. in 2001 further boosted the industry. Today, CAD has its significance in the economy of the medical industry. FDA approved CAD products in the field of breast imaging (mammography, ultrasonography and breast MRI) and chest imaging (radiography and CT) can be seen. In Japan, as part of the  Knowledge Cluster Initiative  of the government, three computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) projects are hosted at the Gifu University since 2004. These projects are regarding the development of CAD systems for the early detection of (1) cerebrovascular diseases using brain MRI and MRA images by detecting lacunar infarcts, unruptured aneurysms, and arterial occlusions; (2) ocular diseases such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy using retinal fundus images; and (3) breast cancers using ultrasound 3-D volumetric whole breast data by detecting the breast masses. The projects are entering their final development stage. Preliminary results are presented in this paper. Clinical examinations will be started soon, and commercialized CAD systems for the above subjects will appear by the completion of this project.",M1

18504665,"[Computer-aided detection of small pulmonary nodules in multidetector spiral computed tomography (MSCT) in children]PURPOSE: Retrospective evaluation of computer-aided detection software (<e>CAD</e>) for automated detection (LungCAD, Siemens Medical solutions, Forchheim, Germany) and volumetry (LungCARE) of pulmonary nodules in dose-reduced pediatric MDCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 scans of 24 children (10.4+/-5.9 years, 13 girls, 11 boys, 39.7+/-29.3 kg body weight) were performed on a 16-MDCT for tumor staging (n=18), inflammation (n=9), other indications (n=3). Tube voltage 120 kVp and effective mAs were adapted to body weight. Slice thickness 2 mm, increment 1 mm. A pediatric radiologist (U1), a CAD expert (U2) and an inexperienced radiologist (U3) independently analyzed the lung window images without and with the CAD as a second reader. In a consensus decision U 1 and U 2 were the reference standard. RESULTS: Five examinations had to be excluded from the study due to other underlying lung disease. A total of 24 pulmonary nodules were found in all data sets with a minimal diameter of 0.35 mm to 3.81 mm (mean 1.7+/-0.85 mm). The sensitivities were as follows: U1 95.8% and 100% with CAD; U2 91.7% U3 66.7%. U2 and U3 did not detect further nodules with CAD. The sensitivity of CAD alone was 41.7 % with 0.32 false-positive findings per examination. Interobserver agreement between U1 / U2 regarding nodule detection with CAD was good (k=0.6500) and without CAD very good (k=0.8727). For the rest (U1 /U3; U2 / U3 with and without CAD), it was weak (k=0.0667-0.1884). Depending on the measured value (axial measurement, volume), there is a significant correlation (p=0.0026-0.0432) between nodule size and CAD detection. Undetected pulmonary nodules (mean 1.35 mm; range 0.35-2.61 mm) were smaller than the detected ones (mean 2.19 mm; range 1.35-3.81 mm). No significant correlation was found between CAD findings and patient age (p=0.9263) and body weight (p=0.9271) as well as nodule location (subpleural, intraparenchymal; p=1.0) and noise/SNR. CONCLUSION: In our study with 2 mm slice thickness and very small lesion sizes, the analyzed CAD algorithm for detection and volumetry of pulmonary nodules has limited application in pediatric dose-reduced 16-MDCTs. Determination of lesion size is possible even in the case of false-negatives.",M1
18496038,"Comparison of radiologist and <e>CAD</e> performance in the detection of CT-confirmed subtle pulmonary nodules on digital chest radiographs.OBJECTIVES: Detection of subtle pulmonary nodules on digital radiography is a challenging task for radiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a newly approved computer aided detection (CAD) system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sensitivity of 3 radiologists and of a CAD system for the detection of pulmonary nodules from 5 to 15 mm in size on digital chest radiography of 117 patients was compared. The reference standard was established by consensus reading of computed tomography scans by 2 experienced radiologists. Computed tomography scans and chest radiographs were performed within 4 weeks. Sixty-six pulmonary nodules from 42 patients, with a mean nodule diameter of 7.5 mm (standard deviation: 2.2 mm), were included in the statistical analysis. Seventy-five of the 117 patients did not have nodules from 5 to 15 mm of size. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-eight false-positive detections of the CAD system were found with an average of 2.5 false-positives per image. Sensitivity of the CAD system was 39.4% (95% confidence interval: 11.8%), when compared with 18.2% to 30.3% (95% confidence interval 9.3% to 11.1%) of the 3 radiologists. Substantial agreement for nodule detection ([kappa]N: 0.64-0.73) was found among the 3 radiologists, whereas only moderate agreement was found between the radiologists and the CAD performance ([kappa]N: 0.45-0.52). CONCLUSIONS: The CAD system's diagnostic sensitivity in detecting pulmonary nodules of 5 to 15 mm of size was superior to the 1 of radiologists. The CAD system may be used for assisting the radiologist in the detection of lung nodules on digital chest radiographs.",M1
18423313,"Evaluation of a real-time interactive pulmonary nodule analysis system on chest digital radiographic images: a prospective study.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the performance of a real-time interactive pulmonary nodule analysis system for evaluation of chest digital radiographic (DR) images in a routine clinical environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A real-time interactive pulmonary nodule analysis system for chest DR image softcopy reading (IQQA-Chest; EDDA Technology, Princeton Junction, NJ) was used in daily practice with a Picture Archiving and Communication System in a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer teaching hospital. Patients referred for follow-up of known cancer underwent digital chest radiography. Posteroanterior and lateral DR images were first read by resident radiologists along with experienced chest radiologists using a Picture Archiving and Communication System work station. The computer-assisted detection (<e>CAD</e>) program was subsequently applied to the posteroanterior DR images, and changes (if any) in diagnosis were recorded. For reference standard, a follow-up chest radiograph at least 6 months following the initial examination or a follow-up computed tomographic scan of the chest within 3 months was used to establish diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Of 324 DR examinations, follow-up imaging according to our parameters was available for 214 patients (67%). Lung nodules were found and subsequently confirmed in 35 patients (10%) without CAD. Using CAD, nodules were found and subsequently confirmed in 51 patients (15%), improving sensitivity from 63.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49%-0.76%) to 92.7% (95% CI, 0.82%-0.98%) (P &lt; .0001, McNemar). Nodules were subsequently proved to be malignant in five of the 16 additional cases (31%). False-positive readings increased from three to six cases; specificity decreased from 98.1% (95% CI, 0.95%-0.99%) to 96.2% (95% CI, 0.92%-0.98%) (not significant). There were 153 true-negative cases (71.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the interpretation of chest radiographs for lung nodules can be improved using an automated CAD nodule detection system. This improvement in reader performance comes with a minimal number of false-positive interpretations.",M1
18423310,"Computer-aided diagnosis of lung cancer and pulmonary embolism in computed tomography-a review.Computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) have been important areas of research in the last two decades.

Recent advances in multidetector row computed tomography have made it an increasingly common modality for imaging of lung diseases. A thoracic examination using thin-section computed tomography contains hundreds of images. Detection of lung cancer and pulmonary embolism on computed tomographic (CT) examinations are demanding tasks for radiologists because they have to search for abnormalities in a large number of images, and the lesions can be subtle.

18383556,"Computer-aided diagnosis using morphological features for classifying breast lesions on ultrasound.OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system with automatic contouring and morphological analysis to aid in the classification of breast tumors using ultrasound. METHODS: We evaluated 118 breast lesions (34 malignant and 84 benign tumors). Each tumor contour was automatically extracted from the digitized ultrasound image. Nineteen practical morphological features from the extracted contour were calculated and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to find independent features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier utilized the selected principal vectors to identify the breast tumor as benign or malignant. In this study, all the cases were sampled with k-fold cross-validation (k = 10) to evaluate the performance by receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The areas under the ROC curves for the proposed CAD systems using all morphological features and the lower-dimensional principal vector were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. The classification ability for breast tumors using morphological information was good. CONCLUSIONS: This system differentiates benign from malignant breast tumors well and therefore provides a clinically useful second opinion. Moreover, the morphological features are nearly setting-independent and thus available to various ultrasound machines.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors have developed a CAD scheme that used both image processing techniques and anatomic knowledge based classification system to improve diagnosis of small AIH on CT. A multiple-reader, multiple-case receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study was performed. Twenty clinicians, including seven emergency physicians, seven radiology residents, and six radiology specialists were recruited as readers of 60 sets of brain CT, including 30 cases that show AIH smaller than 1 cm, and 30 controls. Each reader read the same 60 cases twice, first without, then with the prompts produced by the CAD system. The clinicians ranked their confidence in diagnosing a case of showing AIH, which produced the ROC curves. RESULTS: Significantly improved performance is observed in emergency physicians, average area under the ROC curve (Az) increased from 0.8422 to 0.9294 (P = .0107) when they make the diagnosis without and with the support of CAD. Az for radiology residents increased from 0.9371 to 0.9762 (P = .0088). Az for radiology specialists increased from 0.9742 to 0.9868, but was statistically insignificant (P = .1755).

In particular, emergency physicians can benefit most from the CAD and improve their performance to a level approaching that of the average radiology residents.",M1
18278213,"Computer-aided diagnosis in two-phase 201Tl-SPECT of thoracic lesions.AIM: The retention index, a traditionally quantitative analysis of two-phase (201)Tl single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the chest, is manually calculated by experienced physicians from comparable 2-D ROI. However, a 3-D ROI would provide more information than a 2-D ROI extracted from a single frame of SPECT. We propose a new diagnostic system, computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>), to automatically detect suspicious lesions as 3-D objects on chest (201)Tl-SPECT, and assist the physician in interpreting these images. PATIENTS, METHODS: Seventy patients with thoracic lesions and confirmed diagnoses were enrolled to test this automatic CAD system. The reliability of the CAD system in detecting lesions as 3-D objects was compared to the 2-D ROI of (201)Tl-SPECT found by the manually visualized method. Furthermore, we also proposed a novel index, the retention index using the heart (RIH), to differentiate high retention (slow clearance, increasing target to heart ratio) as a criterion for a malignant lesion, from low retention (faster clearance, small or no increase of the target to heart ratio) for benign lesions. RESULTS: The CAD system can achieve a detection rate of 100% in automatically searching for thoracic lesions in (201)Tl-SPECT. In diagnostic performance, the CAD system with the RIH of comparable 3-D objects has an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, higher than the 0.78 of the traditional RI method (p=0.198).

18263947,"Decision optimization of case-based computer-aided decision systems using genetic algorithms with application to mammography.This paper presents an optimization framework for improving case-based computer-aided decision (CB-<e>CAD</e>) systems. The underlying hypothesis of the study is that each example in the knowledge database of a medical decision support system has different importance in the decision making process. A new decision algorithm incorporating an importance weight for each example is proposed to account for these differences. The search for the best set of importance weights is defined as an optimization problem and a genetic algorithm is employed to solve it. The optimization process is tailored to maximize the system's performance according to clinically relevant evaluation criteria. The study was performed using a CAD system developed for the classification of regions of interests (ROIs) in mammograms as depicting masses or normal tissue. The system was constructed and evaluated using a dataset of ROIs extracted from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). Experimental results show that, according to receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the proposed method significantly improves the overall performance of the CAD system as well as its average specificity for high breast mass detection rates.",M1
18253070,"Nodule detection in a lung region that's segmented with using genetic cellular neural networks and 3D template matching with fuzzy rule based thresholding.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a new method for automated lung nodule detection in serial section CT images with using the characteristics of the 3D appearance of the nodules that distinguish themselves from the vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lung nodules were detected in four steps. First, to reduce the number of region of interests (ROIs) and the computation time, the lung regions of the CTs were segmented using Genetic Cellular Neural Networks (G-CNN). Then, for each lung region, ROIs were specified with using the 8 directional search; +1 or -1 values were assigned to each voxel. The 3D ROI image was obtained by combining all the 2-Dimensional (2D) ROI images. A 3D template was created to find the nodule-like structures on the 3D ROI image. Convolution of the 3D ROI image with the proposed template strengthens the shapes that are similar to those of the template and it weakens the other ones. Finally, fuzzy rule based thresholding was applied and the ROI's were found. To test the system's efficiency, we used 16 cases with a total of 425 slices, which were taken from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset. RESULTS: The computer aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system achieved 100% sensitivity with 13.375 FPs per case when the nodule thickness was greater than or equal to 5.625 mm. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the detection performance of our algorithm is satisfactory, and this may well improve the performance of computer-aided detection of lung nodules.",M1
18239963,"Effect of multiscale processing in digital chest radiography on automated detection of lung nodule with a computer assistance system.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiscale processing in digital chest radiography on automated detection of lung nodule with a computer-aided diagnosis (<e>CAD</e>) system. The study involved 58 small-nodule patient cases and 58 normal cases. The 58 patient cases included a total of 64 noncalcified lung nodules up to 15 mm in diameter. Each case underwent an examination with a digital radiography system (Digital Diagnost, Philips Medical Systems), and the acquired image was processed by the following three types of multiscale processing (Unique Image Processing Package, Philips Medical Systems) respectively: (1) standard image from the default processing parameter (structure preference, 0.0), (2) high-pass image with structure preference of 0.4, (3) low-pass image with structure preference of -0.4. The CAD output images were produced with a real-time computer assistance system (IQQAtrade mark-Chest, EDDA Technology). Two experienced chest radiologists established the nodule gold standard by consensus reading according to computed tomography results, and analyzed and recorded the detection of lung nodules and false-positive detections of these CAD output images. For the entire cases involved (each case with three types of different processing), a total of 348 observations were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean area under the ROC curve (A ( z )) value was 0.700 for the standard images, 0.587 for the high-pass images, and 0.783 for the low-pass images. There were statistically significant A (z) values among these three types of processed images (p &lt; 0.01). Multiscale processing in digital chest radiography can affect the automated detection of lung nodule by CAD, which is consistent with effects from visual inspection.",M1
18215501,"Reader studies for validation of <e>CAD</e> systems.Evaluation of computational intelligence (CI) systems designed to improve the performance of a human operator is complicated by the need to include the effect of human variability. In this paper we consider human (reader) variability in the context of medical imaging computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems, and we outline how to compare the detection performance of readers with and without the CAD. An effective and statistically powerful comparison can be accomplished with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) experiment, summarized by the reader-averaged area under the ROC curve (AUC). The comparison requires sophisticated yet well-developed methods for multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) variance analysis. MRMC variance analysis accounts for random readers, random cases, and correlations in the experiment. In this paper, we extend the methods available for estimating this variability. Specifically, we present a method that can treat arbitrary study designs. Most methods treat only the fully-crossed study design, where every reader reads every case in two experimental conditions. We demonstrate our method with a computer simulation, and we assess the statistical power of a variety of study designs.",M1
18206625,"Heat maps: an aid for data analysis and understanding of ROC <e>CAD</e> experiments.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the value of a new data visualization and exploration method for mutlireader-multicase receiver operating characteristic (MRMC-ROC) experiments of computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms that uses three-dimensional (3D) heat maps tool adapted from gene expression array analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We are using data from a clinical trial of a commercial CAD system for lung cancer detection (RapidScreen RS-2000, Riverain Medical Group, Miamisburg, OH, and Rockville, MD). 3D heat maps, originally developed for displaying changes in gene expression after cancer chemotherapy in MATLAB, were modified to display the radiologists confidence levels as they interpreted chest radiographs and used to visualize the radiologists confidence levels before and after the provision of a CAD system. RESULTS: Heat maps demonstrated the variation among radiologists in their interpretation, and the degree of variation in interpretation when a single radiologist reinterpreted the same case without and with CAD modality. They demonstrated the variability in the identification of each cancer/cancer-free case and the variability of change seen when CAD prompts were provided. CONCLUSIONS: CAD increases the consistency of interpretation of a single radiologist and of a group of radiologists. Heat maps provide a method for data visualization that clarifies the effects of reader variability in ROC CAD experiments. We demonstrated how heat maps can be used to document the complexity of reader variability and suggested how clustering can reveal both nonintuitive and intuitive groupings of cases, readers, and the interaction of both with CAD.",M1
18206613,"Potential effect of different radiologist reporting methods on studies showing benefit of <e>CAD</e>.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of different reporting methods and performance measures on the assessment of the benefit of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in characterizing malignant and benign breast lesions on mammography and sonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a previous study, 10 observers provided three types of reporting data (probability of malignancy [PM] estimates, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] ratings, and biopsy decisions), both without and with CAD. The current study compares alternative performance measures computed from the three types of reporting data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed from both the PM estimates and the BI-RADS ratings, whereas sensitivity and specificity were computed from all three data types. Sensitivity and specificity values calculated from either the PM estimates or the BI-RADS ratings were determined by setting both constant and user-dependent thresholds. Student's t-tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in the performance measures without and with CAD. RESULTS: The average AUC values of the 10 observers calculated from either PM estimates or BI-RADS ratings demonstrated statistically significant improvements in performance with CAD, increasing from 0.87 to 0.92 or 0.93, respectively. However, the statistical significance of improvements in sensitivity or specificity depended on the type of reporting data used. CONCLUSIONS: Use of different types of reporting data in the computation of sensitivity and specificity may result in different conclusions concerning the benefit of CAD. Meaningful determination of sensitivity and specificity from PM estimates require the use of user-dependent thresholds.",M1
18196815,"A <e>CAD</e> system for nodule detection in low-dose lung CTs based on region growing and a new active contour model.A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the selection of lung nodules in computer tomography (CT) images is presented. The system is based on region growing (RG) algorithms and a new active contour model (ACM), implementing a local convex hull, able to draw the correct contour of the lung parenchyma and to include the pleural nodules. The CAD consists of three steps: (1) the lung parenchymal volume is segmented by means of a RG algorithm; the pleural nodules are included through the new ACM technique; (2) a RG algorithm is iteratively applied to the previously segmented volume in order to detect the candidate nodules; (3) a double-threshold cut and a neural network are applied to reduce the false positives (FPs). After having set the parameters on a clinical CT, the system works on whole scans, without the need for any manual selection. The CT database was recorded at the Pisa center of the ITALUNG-CT trial, the first Italian randomized controlled trial for the screening of the lung cancer. The detection rate of the system is 88.5% with 6.6 FPs/CT on 15 CT scans (about 4700 sectional images) with 26 nodules: 15 internal and 11 pleural. A reduction to 2.47 FPs/CT is achieved at 80% efficiency.",M1
18196808,"Computer-aided detection of interstitial abnormalities in chest radiographs using a reference standard based on computed tomography.A computer-aided detection (<e>CAD</e>) system is presented for the localization of interstitial lesions in chest radiographs. The system analyzes the complete lung fields using a two-class supervised pattern classification approach to distinguish between normal texture and texture affected by interstitial lung disease. Analysis is done pixel-wise and produces a probability map for an image where each pixel in the lung fields is assigned a probability of being abnormal. Interstitial lesions are often subtle and ill defined on x-rays and hence difficult to detect, even for expert radiologists. Therefore a new, semiautomatic method is proposed for setting a reference standard for training and evaluating the CAD system. The proposed method employs the fact that interstitial lesions are more distinct on a computed tomography (CT) scan than on a radiograph. Lesion outlines, manually drawn on coronal slices of a CT scan of the same patient, are automatically transformed to corresponding outlines on the chest x-ray, using manually indicated correspondences for a small set of anatomical landmarks. For the texture analysis, local structures are described by means of the multiscale Gaussian filter bank. The system performance is evaluated with ROC analysis on a database of digital chest radiographs containing 44 abnormal and 8 normal cases. The best performance is achieved for the linear discriminant and support vector machine classifiers, with an area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.78. Separate ROC curves are built for classification of abnormalities of different degrees of subtlety versus normal class. Here the best performance in terms of A(z) is 0.90 for differentiation between obviously abnormal and normal pixels. The system is compared with two human observers, an expert chest radiologist and a chest radiologist in training, on evaluation of regions. Each lung field is divided in four regions, and the reference standard and the probability maps are converted into region scores. The system performance does not significantly differ from that of the observers, when the perihilar regions are excluded from evaluation, and reaches A(z) = 0.85 for the system, with A(z) = 0.88 for both observers.",M1
18196782,"Automatic multiscale enhancement and segmentation of pulmonary vessels in CT pulmonary angiography images for <e>CAD</e> applications.The authors are developing a computerized pulmonary vessel segmentation method for a computer-aided pulmonary embolism (PE) detection system on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) images. Because PE only occurs inside pulmonary arteries, an automatic and accurate segmentation of the pulmonary vessels in 3D CTPA images is an essential step for the PE CAD system. To segment the pulmonary vessels within the lung, the lung regions are first extracted using expectation-maximization (EM) analysis and morphological operations. The authors developed a 3D multiscale filtering technique to enhance the pulmonary vascular structures based on the analysis of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at multiple scales. A new response function of the filter was designed to enhance all vascular structures including the vessel bifurcations and suppress nonvessel structures such as the lymphoid tissues surrounding the vessels. An EM estimation is then used to segment the vascular structures by extracting the high response voxels at each scale. The vessel tree is finally reconstructed by integrating the segmented vessels at all scales based on a  connected component  analysis. Two CTPA cases containing PEs were used to evaluate the performance of the system. One of these two cases also contained pleural effusion disease. Two experienced thoracic radiologists provided the gold standard of pulmonary vessels including both arteries and veins by manually tracking the arterial tree and marking the center of the vessels using a computer graphical user interface. The accuracy of vessel tree segmentation was evaluated by the percentage of the  gold standard  vessel center points overlapping with the segmented vessels. The results show that 96.2% (2398/2494) and 96.3% (1910/1984) of the manually marked center points in the arteries overlapped with segmented vessels for the case without and with other lung diseases. For the manually marked center points in all vessels including arteries and veins, the segmentation accuracy are 97.0% (4546/4689) and 93.8% (4439/4732) for the cases without and with other lung diseases, respectively. Because of the lack of ground truth for the vessels, in addition to quantitative evaluation of the vessel segmentation performance, visual inspection was conducted to evaluate the segmentation. The results demonstrate that vessel segmentation using our method can extract the pulmonary vessels accurately and is not degraded by PE occlusion to the vessels in these test cases.",M1
20579560,"Can retinal changes predict coronary artery disease in elderly hypertensive patients presenting with angina?BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) has been increasing in India, and so is the population of elderly patients with hypertension. In the predominantly resource-poor setting prevailing in India, this study is an effort to analyze the accuracy of retinal changes in predicting CAD among a cohort of elderly patients with hypertension presenting to the emergency department with angina. METHODS: A total of 72 elderly patients with hypertension older than 65 years presenting to the emergency department with acute angina were studied. Optic fundi were assessed for retinopathy after pupillary dilatation, which were photographed. All patients underwent coronary angiogram, and the presence or absence of CAD was determined. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age of the participants was 72.95 +/- 6.51 years, and there were 39 men (54.2%) and 33 women (45.8%). Prevalence of CAD and retinopathy was 40.8% and 30.6%, respectively. Coronary artery disease showed a strong association with retinopathy (P &lt; .0001). Male sex (P = .035), microalbuminuria (P = .025), and increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = .001) were identified as risk factors for CAD. Tests of accuracy for retinopathy as a predictor of CAD showed a likelihood ratio of a positive test and likelihood ratio of a negative test of 3.92 and 0.52, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 70.6%. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of CAD (40.8%) and retinopathy (30.6%) was quite high in our cohort of elderly patients with hypertension. Retinal changes of any grade have a moderate accuracy in predicting CAD and, hence, may be used as an early screening tool in a resource poor setting.",M2

20538671,"Diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of left main and triple vessel coronary artery disease: a comparative meta-analysis.OBJECTIVES: Compare the diagnostic performance of stress echocardiography (SE) and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the diagnosis of left main disease (LM) and triple vessel disease (TVD). BACKGROUND: Limited comparative data on MPI and SE for the detection of LM and TVD (high-risk coronary artery disease) exist in the literature. METHODS: Quantitative meta-analysis was performed using studies identified by systematic electronic literature search. Articles were included if they reported data on exercise, dobutamine SE or exercise, adenosine, dipyridamole, thallium201, technetium 99m sestamibi MPI and used coronary angiography as the reference test. Summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curves were constructed for each imaging modality. Additionally, pooled sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated per modality. Meta-regression was performed to adjust for patient and study characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria; 23 (MPI-15; SE-14; Common studies-6) provided sufficient data for analysis. In a SROC model comparing the two imaging modalities, SE was associated with higher area under curve (0.82 (0.03) vs 0.73 (0.02), p=0.01) and index Q* value (0.75 (0.02) vs 0.67 (0.02), p=0.01). Using pooled summary point estimates, SE had higher pooled sensitivity (94% vs 75%, p&lt;0.001) and lower negative likelihood ratio (0.21 vs 0.47, p&lt;0.001) compared to MPI. No evidence of a difference in the pooled specificity (40% vs 48%, p=0.16) and positive likelihood ratio (1.52 vs 1.58, p=0.36) was seen between the two stress modalities. Pooled diagnostic OR on meta-regression (9.78 vs 4.06, p=0.02) remained significantly higher for SE compared to MPI for identification of LM and TVD even after adjustment for study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Since LM alone or in combination with TVD are categorised as representing potentially life-threatening variants of <e>CAD</e>, a screening test with high sensitivity, low negative likelihood ratio or higher discriminatory capacity would be desirable for risk stratification. In the absence of a direct head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of SE and MPI, our findings indicate that SE appears to be the preferred screening modality for high-risk coronary artery disease.",M2
20538125,"Prognostic value of coronary computed tomographic angiography in asymptomatic patients.To assess the value of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) in the prediction of cardiac events in asymptomatic patients, 451 consecutive asymptomatic patients who underwent CCTA from December 2003 to November 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of cardiac events, defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, and late revascularization (&gt;90 days after CCTA) during a median follow-up period of 27.5 months. Secondary end points were the prevalence of nonobstructive coronary lesions and the number of patients reclassified regarding their cardiovascular risk. Two hundred twenty-nine patients (54%) had nonobstructive coronary lesions, and 107 patients (24%) obstructive coronary artery disease. During follow-up, there were 2 cases of unstable angina and 8 revascularizations for stable angina. Patients with obstructive coronary artery disease had a significantly higher event rate than those without obstructive <e>CAD</e> (risk ratio 13.9, 95% confidence interval 4.0 to 48.0). In 217 patients (48%), the clinically assessed cardiovascular risk could be reclassified by CCTA from intermediate or high to low risk. In conclusion, although the event rate was low in asymptomatic patients, CCTA could reliably predict further cardiac events and could reclassify 2/3 of patients regarding their cardiovascular risk.",M2
20529979,"Association of reduced zinc status with angiographically severe coronary atherosclerosis: a pilot study.In vitro studies attribute antiatherogenic and insulin-like properties to zinc (Zn). However, only a few conflicting clinical data exist concerning the relationship between Zn and coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) as well as glycemic indices. We studied 72 patients without prior history of myocardial infarction or revascularization procedures, who underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of chest pain. Coronary artery disease severity was estimated using 3 angiographic scores. Zn in serum and 24-hour urine, as well as serum Zn/24-hour urine Zn ratio were determined. Serum Zn was not associated with CAD prevalence and severity. However, urinary Zn loss was significantly higher among patients with CAD and showed a positive association with CAD severity. Serum Zn/24-hour urine Zn ratio was inversely associated with CAD, as well as with diabetes mellitus prevalence, fasting glucose, and glycated hemoglobin levels. Low serum Zn/24-hour urine Zn ratio is associated with angiographically severe atherosclerosis and impaired glucose homeostasis.",M2
20527635,"Correlation of cardiac troponin I levels (10 folds upper limit of normal) and extent of coronary artery disease in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.OBJECTIVE: To determine the correlation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) 10 folds upper limit of normal (ULN) and extent of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) in Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 230 consecutive NSTEMI patients admitted in Tabba Heart Institute, Karachi between April to December 2008. cTnI was measured using MEIA method. All patients underwent coronary angiography in the index hospitalization. Stenosis &gt; or = 70% in any of the three major epicardial vessels was considered significant CAD. Extent of CAD was defined as significant single, two or three vessel CAD. Chi-square test was applied to test the association between cTnI levels and CAD extent. RESULTS: Out of 230 patients, in 111 patients with cTnI levels &lt; or = 10 folds upper limit of normal (ULN), 25 (22.52%) had single vessel, 40 (36%) had two vessel and 34 (30.6%) had three vessel significant CAD, whereas in 119 patients with cTnI levels &gt; 10 folds ULN, 23 (19.3%) had single vessel, 37 (31.1%) had two vessel and 55 (46.2%) had three vessel significant CAD. The results suggest that there was an insignificant association between the cTnI levels and single vessel, two vessel and the overall CAD extent (p = 0.35, p = 0.21 and p= 0.13 respectively), however there was a statistically significant association between the cTnI levels and three vessel CAD (p &lt; 0.04). CONCLUSION: Higher cTnI levels are associated with an increased proportion of severe three vessel CAD involvement. Prompt identification and referral of this patient subset to early revascularization strategies would improve clinical outcomes.",M2
20494661,"Anger, suppressed anger, and risk of adverse events in patients with coronary artery disease.Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20%) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9%) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality.",M2
20494660,"Influence of age on revascularization related costs of hospitalization among patients of stable coronary artery disease.The legitimacy of expensive revascularization procedures in patients with stable coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) remains to be seen. In this study, resource utilization was compared across age-group categories of patients with stable CAD who underwent revascularization. Fiscal year 2006 discharge data maintained by the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission were examined. Current Procedural Terminology codes 36.1x and 36.0x were used to identify patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), respectively. Patients with acute myocardial infarctions (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 410.xx) were excluded to limit the study group to patients with stable CAD. Totals of 1,066, 2,909, 4,272, 4,514, and 1570 hospitalizations per 100,000 hospitalizations were observed in the age groups 40 to 50, 50 to 60, 60 to 70, 70 to 80, and &gt; or =80 years, respectively. The costs of hospitalization were driven by length of stay and choice of revascularization procedure (CABG vs PCI). There was trend toward increasing total costs and longer hospital stays with increasing age (p for trend &lt;0.001) in patients who underwent CABG. Although the adjusted costs and adjusted length of stay were significantly higher in the patients who underwent PCI who were aged &gt; or =80 years than in those aged 40 to 50 years, the differences among other age-group categories were not statistically significant. In conclusion, older patients with stable CAD who undergo interventions represent a substantial expenditure. Hospitalization costs are driven by longer hospital stays and the choice of CABG compared to PCI. With data supporting aggressive medical management of such patients, it is advisable to rethink management strategies in these patients.",M2
20494658,"Meta-analysis of studies comparing coronary artery bypass grafting with drug-eluting stenting in patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease.This meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) compared to drug-eluting stenting (DES) in patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). CABG has been the preferred revascularization strategy in patients with diabetes compared to DES. Drug-eluting stents reduce the rate of target vessel revascularization compared to bare-metal stents. The ideal revascularization strategy for patients with diabetes with multivessel CAD in the DES era is unknown. A search of published reports was performed to identify clinical studies comparing CABG with DES in patients with diabetes with multivessel CAD with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Five studies including 1,543 patients with diabetes (757 who underwent CABG and 786 who underwent DES) met the selection criteria. The mean follow-up period was 18 months (range 12 to 36). Compared to DES, CABG was associated with a lower risk for major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.65), driven mainly by a lower risk for repeat revascularization (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.30), despite having a higher percentage of triple-vessel disease. There was no significant difference in death (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.39) or myocardial infarction (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.61). Patients in the CABG group had a higher risk for cerebrovascular events (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.68). In conclusion, PCI with DES is safe and may represent a viable alternative to CABG for selected patients with diabetes with multivessel CAD.",M2
20494653,"Prognosis of asymptomatic coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.The appropriate treatment for asymptomatic patients with obstructive coronary stenoses is controversial. The effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the prognosis of such patients is unknown. The present study compared the 1-year outcomes of patients with stable coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) with regard to the presence or absence of symptoms after elective PCI. A total of 1,944 consecutive patients with stable CAD who had undergone elective PCI were studied. They were divided into 2 groups according to symptom status: asymptomatic (n = 1,052) and symptomatic (n = 892). A 1-year follow-up evaluation was conducted by office visit and telephone interview. The end points consisted of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Patients without angina pectoris were older, predominantly men, and more frequently had chronic renal insufficiency, a previous myocardial infarction, a coronary artery bypass graft, and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction. The 1-year mortality rate was greater in the asymptomatic patients (43 [4.1%] vs 16 [1.8%], p = 0.003). The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization was similar in the 2 groups (15 [1.5%] vs 12 [1.4%], p = 0.85; and 69 [6.7%] vs 68 [7.7%], p = 0.39, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the absence of symptoms was a strong independent predictor of 1-year mortality (p = 0.017). In conclusion, in patients with stable CAD undergoing elective PCI, the absence of symptoms was associated with an increase in 1-year mortality.",M2
20483809,"Extracranial carotid stenosis and peripheral arterial disease in Thai patients with coronary artery disease.We assessed the prevalence of carotid stenosis (CS) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) to determine the relationship between these conditions in a Thai population. All patients with coronary angiography during June 2008 and August 2009 were studied. Carotid duplex and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were performed. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were studied (95 men, mean age of 65). Carotid stenosis and PAD were diagnosed in 16 patients (9%) and 68 patients (38.4%), respectively. The presence of carotid bruit and older age were independent predictors of CS and PAD, respectively. There was no correlation between the presence of CS/PAD and the extent of coronary artery lesions. Although CS was uncommon in patients with CAD, the patients with cervical bruit should be screened for CS. Prevalence of PAD was high, confirming the presence of diffuse atherosclerosis in many patients with CAD.",M2
20470999,"The association of the Friesinger score and pulse pressure in an urban South Asian patient population: pulse pressure, an independent predictor of coronary artery disease.Increase in pulse pressure has been shown to be predisposing factor for Coronary Artery Disease (<e>CAD</e>) in diverse patient populations but its relationship with the severity of CAD, particularly in the South Asians immigrant population of United States has not been demonstrated. We performed a single-center, cross-sectional study. Pulse pressure was calculated by the difference between the systolic and diastolic brachial blood pressures, and the Friesinger score (FS) was used to quantify the severity of CAD with the score of 5 used as a cutoff for extensive disease. We also sought to assess the correlation between the Friesinger score and the 10-year cardiovascular event (CVD) risk as calculated by the Framingham score. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the associations between explanatory variables and a high Friesinger score were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models. P values below .05 were considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 10 software package (College Station, TX). The mean pulse pressure was significantly higher in participants with an FS of &gt; or =5 compared with participants with an FS of &lt;5 (63 vs. 46 mm Hg; P = .004). In univariate analysis, a pulse pressure &gt; or =40 mm Hg was associated with a five-fold increased odds of a higher FS compared with a pulse pressure &lt;40 mm Hg (P = .039), which was unchanged in multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, even after adjustment for presence of hypertension, a 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure was associated with a 1.97-fold increased odds of a higher FS (95% CI 1.22-3.71, P = .009). The mean Framingham score was higher in participants with a higher FS, but this difference was not significant (32.7 vs. 20.3; P = .1139). Our study demonstrates that pulse pressure, a well-established marker of vascular health, is a significant independent predictor of the severity of CAD as assessed by coronary angiography in South Asians.",M2
20466232,"What proportion of patients with chest pain are potentially suitable for computed tomography coronary angiography?OBJECTIVES: Serial electrocardiographic and biomarker data are used to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain. These do not identify coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). Functional tests are often used but have limitations. Multislice computed tomography coronary angiography (MSCT-CA) is evolving rapidly, raising the possibility of fast, accurate, and relatively noninvasive anatomical testing for CAD. We aimed to quantify the proportion of ED rule-out ACS patients suitable for MSCT-CA. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study (by explicit record review) included adult patients who underwent a rule-out ACS process in ED-associated short-stay units. Data collected included demographics, electrocardiographic and biomarker data, contraindications/factors likely to make MSCT-CA unsuccessful or difficult to interpret including irregular heart rhythm, high pulse rate (with rate control contraindicated), renal or thyroid disease, contrast allergy, metformin use, pregnancy, and already confirmed CAD. Outcome of interest was the proportion of patients suitable for MSCT-CA. Data analysis is by descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty patients were studied (63% male; median age, 63 years). Forty-nine percent (224/460; 95% confidence interval, 44%-53%) were suitable for MSCT-CA. One hundred eighty-one (39%) already had known CAD. Reasons for unsuitability of the remainder were metformin use 18 (6%), irregular heart rhythm 15 (5%), renal dysfunction 12 (4%), high pulse rate with contraindications to rate control 8 (3%), thyroid disease 7 (3%), and contrast allergy 2 (0.7%). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of ED patients with chest pain who have underwent ACS rule-out were potentially suitable for MSCT-CA to identify CAD. The best use of MSCT-CA in the investigation of patients with chest pain requires further clarification.",M2
20458834,"Enhanced external counterpulsation: mechanisms of action and clinical applications.Symptomatic coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and heart failure (HF), either of ischaemic or nonischaemic aetiology, are common medical problems. Despite optimal medical treatment and improved revascularisation techniques, a significant number of patients are not successfully managed.Among the non-pharmacological, alternative, non-invasive treatments suggested for these patients, enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is considered the most effective one. EECP, administered in an outpatient setting, consists of three pneumatic cuffs applied to each of the patient's legs that are sequentially inflated and deflated synchronised with the cardiac cycle. Numerous clinical trials have shown that EECP is safe and effective in patients with ischaemic heart disease, with or without left ventricular dysfunction, improving their quality of life. EECP appears to be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy in patients with HF of any aetiology. Cardiac syndrome X has been shown to be effectively treated with EECP. Research in EECP expanded in its potential use for entities other than heart disease. More trials are necessary, including sham-controlled trials, to further establish EECP among medical society.",M2
20451679,"Comparison of high risk stress myocardial perfusion imaging findings in men with rapid versus prolonged recovery of ST-segment depression after exercise stress testing.ST-segment depression during stress testing predicts future risk for adverse cardiovascular events and routinely prompts further noninvasive imaging or invasive evaluation for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). A subset of patients develop ST depression at peak exercise that rapidly resolves early in the recovery period (ST-rapid). The goal of this study was to compare the prevalence of single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) findings in patients with ST-rapid to those with prolonged ST depression (ST-prolonged) and those without ST depression (ST-normal). A total of 637 men without previous CAD and with interpretable rest electrocardiograms referred for exercise stress MPI were included in this study. ST depression was defined as &gt; or =1-mm ST depression occurring 80 ms after the J point at peak exercise. ST-rapid was defined as ST depression with recovery of the ST depression by 1 minute into recovery. Men with ST-rapid were younger (55.4 +/- 7.6 vs 62.6 +/- 9.6 years, p &lt;0.001) and had better exercise capacity (11.2 +/- 2.8 vs 9.4 +/- 3.0 METs, p &lt;0.001) than men with ST-prolonged. Compared to ST-prolonged, ST-rapid was associated with significantly less mild CAD (summed stress score &gt; or =4; 27% vs 47%, p = 0.02), severe CAD (summed stress score &gt;8; 9% vs 29%, p = 0.004), and a composite of high-risk MPI findings (summed stress score &gt;8 or ejection fraction &lt;40%; 11% vs 32%, p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in exercise capacity, the presence of CAD, or the composite of high-risk MPI findings between men with ST-rapid and those with ST-normal. In conclusion, men who developed ST-rapid during exercise stress testing had markedly fewer abnormal and high-risk MPI findings compared to those with prolonged ST depression. In fact, the prevalence of MPI abnormalities in men with ST-rapid was similar to that in men with normal electrocardiographic responses to exercise.",M2
20435188,"Clinical synergy of perindopril and calcium-channel blocker in the prevention of cardiac events and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Post hoc analysis of the EUROPA study.BACKGROUND: The purposes of the study were to determine the effects of addition of perindopril to long-term continuous treatment with calcium-channel blocker (CCB) on cardiac outcomes in the stable coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) population of EUROPA and to explore the presence of synergy between perindopril and CCB in secondary prevention. METHODS: We identified participants receiving CCB at every visit during the 4.2-year follow-up and analyzed the effect of addition of perindopril (n = 1,022 perindopril/CCB vs n = 1,100 placebo/CCB). RESULTS: Addition of perindopril to CCB significantly reduced total mortality by 46% (P &lt; .01 vs placebo) and primary end point (a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest) by 35% (P &lt; .05 vs placebo). There were 41%, 54%, and 28% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and myocardial infarction, respectively. Comparison of hazard ratios suggests the presence of a clinical synergy between perindopril and CCB, with a greater effect than addition of individual effects. CONCLUSION: Addition of perindopril to CCB in stable CAD patients had a significant supplementary impact on cardiac outcomes and mortality.",M2
20431065,"Chemokine ligand 2 genetic variants, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels, and the risk of coronary artery disease.OBJECTIVE: In humans, evidence about the association between levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), its coding gene chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and risk of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) is contradictory. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a nested case-control study in the prospective EPIC-Norfolk cohort investigating the relationship between CCL2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MCP-1 concentrations, and the risk of future CAD. Cases (n=1138) were apparently healthy men and women aged 45 to 79 years who developed fatal or nonfatal CAD during a mean follow-up of 6 years. Controls (n=2237) were matched by age, sex, and enrollment time. Using linear regression analysis no association between CCL2 SNPs and MCP-1 serum concentrations became apparent, nor did we find a significant association between MCP-1 serum levels and risk of future CAD. Finally, Cox regression analysis showed no significant association between CCL2 SNPs and the future CAD risk. In addition, we did not find any robust associations between the CCL2 haplotypes and MCP-1 serum concentration or future CAD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support previous publications indicating that MCP-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of CAD.",M2
20430343,"Coronary distensibility index measured by computed tomography is associated with the severity of coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic changes within the coronary artery wall can affect vessel distensibility. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the relationship between the coronary distensibility index (CDI) and the severity of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) measured by computed tomographic angiography (CTA). METHODS: One hundred thirteen subjects, age 63 +/- 10 years, 32% women, who underwent coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning and CTA, were studied. Early diastolic and mid diastolic (MD) cross-section area (CSA) of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery were measured 5 mm distal to the left main bifurcation. CDI was defined as Deltalumen CSA/[lumen CSA in MD x estimated central pulse pressure (eCPP)] x 10(3) {eCPP = 0.77 x peripheral pulse pressure}. LAD diameter measured by CTA and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was compared in 19 subjects without CAD. CAD was defined as normal (no stenosis and CAC 0), mild (stenosis &lt;or= 30%), moderate (stenosis 31%-69%), and severe (stenosis &gt;or= 70%) on CTA. RESULTS: Excellent correlation was observed between CTA and QCA measured by CDI (r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.0001). CDI decreased from normal coronaries (6.75 +/- 1.43) to arteries with mild (5.78 +/- 1.45), moderate (3.96 +/- 1.06), and severe (3.31 +/- 1.06) disease (P = 0.004). The risk factor adjusted odds ratio of lowest versus 2 upper tertiles of CDI was 1.28 for mild, 8.47 for moderate, and 10.59 for severe CAD compared with the normal cohort. The area under the ROC curve to predict obstructive CAD (stenosis &gt;or= 50%) increased significantly from 0.71 to 0.84 by addition of CDI to CAC (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: CTA-measured CDI is inversely related to the severity of CAD independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and CAC.",M2
20410412,"Cost-effectiveness of coronary CT angiography in evaluation of patients without symptoms who have positive stress test results.OBJECTIVE: Patients without symptoms who have positive stress test results are often referred for diagnostic catheter angiography in an evaluation for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). The purpose of this study was to use decision tree analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness and radiation dose that would result from performing coronary CT angiography (CTA) before catheterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree was constructed to compare the false-negative rates, false-positive rates, costs, and radiation exposure of direct referral of patients for cardiac catheterization with the values associated with performing coronary CTA before catheterization. We assumed that patients referred for coronary CTA proceed to catheterization only when significant disease is identified. Costs for coronary CTA and diagnostic catheterization were obtained from the 2009 physician Medicare fee schedule. Sensitivity, specificity, and radiation dose were obtained by literature review. RESULTS: Cost reduction with coronary CTA depends on the prevalence of coronary artery disease, but overall costs are reduced as long as the prevalence is less than 85%. At a 50% prevalence of coronary artery disease, performing coronary CTA before cardiac catheterization results in an average cost saving of $789 per patient with a false-negative rate of 2.5% and average additional radiation exposure of 1-2 mSv. CONCLUSION: Performing coronary CTA before cardiac catheterization is a cost-effective strategy in the care of patients without symptoms who have positive stress test results when the probability that the patient has significant coronary artery disease is less than 50%. The false-negative rate with this strategy compares favorably with the false-negative rate of stress testing. The use of coronary CTA in this role can avoid many unnecessary cardiac catheterization procedures.",M2
20386763,"Genomics in coronary artery disease: past, present and future.The past three years has seen the completion of a series of genome-wide association studies designed to identify genetic variants associated with risk for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) or its related phenotype, myocardial infarction (MI). The first and most robust genetic risk variant is located on chromosome 9p21.3. A series of other loci, with less prevalence and smaller population-attributable risks, were described to associate with CAD/MI. However, these loci explain only a fraction of the heritable component of CAD/MI. A small fraction of these loci alter the function of genes known to be involved in atherogenesis and/or thrombosis. The rest do not appear to impart their risk via any known risk factors, implying yet unknown pathogenetic pathways. Moreover, many loci, including 9p21, are located in intergenic segments and elicit the phenotype by novel mechanisms whose elucidation will most likely unravel novel therapeutic targets. Future investigation will be focused on defining the underlying mechanism by which the phenotype is affected, the role of these genetic markers in standard risk prediction models and identification of further loci to explain the 'missing heritability'.",M2
20403579,"Serum levels of apelin and ghrelin in patients with acute coronary syndromes and established coronary artery disease--KOZANI STUDY.Apelin and ghrelin have emerged as novel adipokines, but their role in coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) remains obscure. In the present study, we analyzed their serum levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or established asymptomatic CAD. A total of 355 participants were enrolled. Among them were 80 patients with unstable angina (UA) and 115 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalized in the coronary care unit. We also included 88 asymptomatic patients with established CAD (asymptomatic CAD) and 72 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). All groups with CAD underwent coronary angiography, and the Gensini score was determined. Clinical parameters, glycemic and lipid profile, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), as well as apelin and ghrelin were assayed. Patients with ACS (UA or AMI) were sampled at hospital admission. All 3 groups with CAD (UA, AMI, or asymptomatic CAD) showed significantly higher levels of hsCRP, HOMA-IR, and white blood cells than controls (P &lt; 0.01). Conversely, apelin and ghrelin concentrations were considerably (P &lt; 0.05) lower in CAD patients with respect to the control group. Most importantly, UA (6.72 +/- 3.51 ng/mL) and AMI (6.02 +/- 4.07 ng/mL) groups had even lower apelin levels on admission compared with the asymptomatic CAD group (13.53 +/- 5.2 ng/mL) (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed an independent association of low apelin and ghrelin levels with CAD presence. Besides this result, apelin showed an inverse relationship with ACS incidence and a Gensini score independent of other cardiovascular risk factors (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, CAD seemed to correlate with low serum apelin and ghrelin levels. Moreover, apelin concentrations inversely were associated with the severity and the acute phase of CAD, which suggests its involvement in the progression and destabilization of coronary atherosclerotic plaques.",M2
20403475,"Comparison of exercise electrocardiography, technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography, and dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography for detection of coronary artery disease in hypertensive women.To assess the performance of currently used stress tests for the detection of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) in a series of female hypertensive patients. We performed exercise electrocardiography (ECG), technetium-99m sestamibi (MIBI) single photon emission computed tomography, dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography, and coronary angiography in 76 hypertensive women. Of the 76 study patients, 31 (41%) had significant CAD. The sensitivity of exercise ECG (81%), MIBI scanning (90%), and dobutamine echocardiography (87%) was greater than that of dipyridamole echocardiography (61%). This finding resulted from the lower sensitivity of dipyridamole echocardiography in the detection of single-vessel CAD (47% vs 76%, 88%, and 82% for the other 3 methods). In contrast, the sensitivity of the 4 tests was similar in the detection of multivessel CAD. The specificity of exercise ECG (56%) and MIBI scanning (53%) was less than that of dobutamine (82%, both p &lt;0.01) and dipyridamole (91%, both p &lt;0.001) echocardiography. This finding related to the lower specificity of exercise ECG in patients with either left ventricular hypertrophy or ST-T abnormalities at rest compared to the specificity in patients without these disorders (33% vs 89%, p &lt;0.01). A lower MIBI scan specificity was found only in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (31% vs 66%, p &lt;0.05). The overall accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography reached 84% compared to exercise ECG (66%, p &lt;0.01), MIBI scan (68%, p &lt;0.05), and dipyridamole echocardiography (79%, p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, dobutamine echocardiography yielded satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for identifying CAD in hypertensive women. Although dipyridamole echocardiography had the greatest specificity, it might be limited in detecting mild CAD. Both exercise ECG and MIBI scanning had fare sensitivity; however, our findings limit the usefulness of these 2 tests in unselected patients.",M2
20403467,"Effect of atrial fibrillation on outcome in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease referred for exercise stress testing.The association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) remains controversial. In addition, the relation of AF to myocardial ischemia and outcomes in patients with known or suspected CAD referred for exercise stress testing has been poorly explored. In this study, 17,100 patients aged &gt; or = 50 years with known or suspected CAD who underwent exercise electrocardiography (n = 11,911) or exercise echocardiography (n = 5,189) were evaluated. End points were all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Overall, 619 patients presented with AF at the time of the tests. Patients with AF who had interpretable electrocardiograms had a lower likelihood of exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment abnormalities (adjusted odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.76, p = 0.001), and those with AF who underwent exercise echocardiography had a lower likelihood of new or worsening exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (adjusted odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.87, p = 0.006). During a mean follow-up period of 6.5 + or - 3.9 years, 2,364 patients died, 1,311 had nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 1,615 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and 922 underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. The 10-year mortality rate was 43% in patients with AF compared to 19% in those without AF (p &lt;0.001). In multivariate analysis, AF remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.76, p &lt;0.001), but not of nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. In conclusion, despite being associated with an apparently lower likelihood of myocardial ischemia, AF was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with known or suspected CAD referred for exercise stress testing.",M2
20403154,"Common genetic variants on chromosome 9p21 are associated with myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes in an Italian population.BACKGROUND: A genomic region on chromosome 9p21 has been identified as closely associated with increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and to type 2 diabetes (T2D) although the evidence suggests that the genetic variants within chromosome 9p21 that contribute to CAD are different from those that contribute to T2D.We carried out an association case-control study in an Italian population to test the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the 9p21 locus, rs2891168 and rs10811661, previously reported by the PROCARDIS study, and respectively myocardial infarction (MI) and T2D. Our aim was to confirm the previous findings on a larger sample and to verify the independence of their susceptibility effects: rs2891168 associated with MI but not with T2D and rs10811661 associated with T2D but not with MI. METHODS: Genomic DNA samples of 2407 Italians with T2D (602 patients), who had had a recent MI (600), or had both diseases (600) and healthy controls (605) were genotyped for the two SNPs. The genotypes were determined by allelic discrimination using a fluorescent-based TaqMan assay. RESULTS: SNP rs2891168 was associated with MI, but not with T2D and the G-allele odds ratio (OR) was 1.20 (95% CI 1.02-1.41); SNP rs10811661 was associated with T2D, but not with MI, and the T-allele OR was 1.27 (95% CI 1.04-1.55). ORs estimates from the present study and the PROCARDIS study were pooled and confirmed the previous findings, with greater precision. CONCLUSIONS: Our replication study showed that rs2891168 and rs10811661 are independently associated respectively with MI and T2D in an Italian population. Pooling our results with those reported by the PROCARDIS group, we also obtained a significant result of association with diabetes for rs10811661 in the European population.",M2
20398150,"Adiponectin isoforms in elderly patients with or without coronary artery disease.OBJECTIVES: To study the distribution of adiponectin isoforms in a group of very old patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Geriatric ambulatory clinic of the Department of Medicine at Policlinico  Tor Vergata.  PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eight elderly adults (mean age 85.0+/-3.2) with or without a history of a previous myocardial infarction as proof of established coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) at least 3 months before entry into the study. Accordingly, subjects were divided into CAD positive (CAD+, n=50) and CAD negative (CAD-, n=58). MEASUREMENT: Assessment of adiponectin isoforms along with metabolic, lipid, and inflammatory profiles. RESULTS: CAD+ subjects had significantly higher levels of total adiponectin (Tot-Ad) and low-molecular-weight adiponectin (LMW-Ad) than CAD- subjects (P=.008 for both). LMW-Ad and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were positively correlated, even after adjustment for waist circumference, sex, glomerular filtration rate, and presence of diabetes mellitus (correlation coefficient (r)=0.25, P=.05). This association was not confirmed when CAD+ subjects were analyzed alone. A positive association was found in CAD+ subjects between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-Ad), and Tot-Ad (r=0.798 and r=0.795, P&lt;.001 for all) but not LMW-Ad. CONCLUSION: Distribution of adiponectin isoforms differed in populations of elderly subjects according to the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. The data support the hypothesis for a protective role of LMW-Ad during aging, although additional studies are needed to definitively clarify whether LMW-Ad plays a protective role in older people with a history of CAD.",M2
20395594,"Epicardial adipokines in obesity and coronary artery disease induce atherogenic changes in monocytes and endothelial cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that release of adipokines by epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is dysregulated in obesity and/or coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>), along with the previously documented expansion of the tissue, and that these molecules induce pathophysiological changes in human monocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In white nondiabetic patients with CAD (n=62) or without CAD (control group) (n=32), subdivided by body mass index of &lt;or=27 and &gt;27, 13 cytokines were identified by protein array analysis as EAT products. Interleukin 6, interleukin 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, growth-related oncogene-alpha, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were the most abundant. Adiponectin release was suppressed in patients with obesity and CAD, and regulated on activation T-cell and secreted (RANTES) was induced in patients with CAD. EAT-conditioned media induced migration of monocytic tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (THP-1) cells, an effect exacerbated in those with CAD. Moreover, conditioned media from patients with CAD and body mass index of &gt;27 increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to human coronary artery endothelial cells by 15.1% (P=0.002) and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 by 2.8-fold (P=0.002). This effect was reversed by recombinant adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: EAT products are altered in both obesity and CAD and induce atherogenic changes in relevant target cells.",M2
20395520,"Oxidized-LDL/beta(2)-glycoprotein I complexes are associated with disease severity and increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes.Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)/beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) complexes have been implicated in atherogenesis. oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes were measured in 339 patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. Approximately 68% had angiographically documented coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and significantly higher mean + or - SD levels of oxLDL/beta2GPI (3.75 + or - 6.31 U/mL) than patients with normal coronary arteries (2.21 + or - 3.03 U/mL; P = .0026). Patients with severe CAD had significantly higher mean + or - SD levels of oxLDL/beta2GPI (8.71 + or - 12.87 U/mL) compared with the overall mean of 3.25 U/mL (P &lt; .05) and a significantly higher rate (28.9%) of adverse events than the overall rate of 11.2% (P &lt; .05). Patients with adverse events had higher mean + or - SD levels of oxLDL/beta2GPI (4.05 + or - 5.38 U/mL) than patients without adverse events (3.15 + or - 5.53; P = .029). The relative risk for adverse events in higher oxLDL/beta2GPI quartiles was 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-9.1; P = .06) for quartile 3 and 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-10.4; P = .02) for quartile 4. Our results support the concept that oxLDL/beta2GPI complexes are associated with severity of CAD and a 3.5-fold increased risk for adverse outcomes.",M2
20391959,"Low glucose blood levels are associated with abnormal cardiac sympatho-vagal balance in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glycemic control has been suggested to improve prognosis in diabetic patients, but recent trials failed to show benefits from intensive glycemic control. Hypoglycaemic episodes or large variability in glucose blood levels causing a sympatho-vagal imbalance of cardiac autonomic function (CAF) might play a role in this result. In our study we assessed whether blood glucose fluctuation may be related to variations in CAF during daily life in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with CAD (65+/-4 years, 2 women) underwent simultaneous 48-hour ECG Holter monitoring and continuous interstitial glucose measurements. The highest and lowest glucose levels for each 3-hour segments of the day were identified and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were measured on Holter recordings on 5-minute intervals centred on these times. RESULTS: Overall, 294 glucose levels were available for analysis. In the whole population several HRV indices were significantly lower in correspondence of the lowest glucose blood levels and this difference was much more evident in patients who were not taking beta-blockers, than in patients who were taking beta-blockers. A significant, although mild, correlation was found between glucose blood levels and several time-and frequency domain HRV variables in patients not taking beta-blockers, but not in these on beta-blockers therapy. DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that, in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, hypoglycaemic episodes are associated with depressed HRV and that beta-blocking agents are able to contrast this relation. These interesting results merit to be investigated in a larger population of patients.",M2
20391484,"Increased levels of serum pentraxin 3, a novel cardiovascular biomarker, in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease.OBJECTIVE: Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a key component of innate immunity, is a strong marker of disease severity in coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). The aim of this study was to compare levels of serum PTX3 in CAD patients with and without inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD) and in healthy controls. METHODS: We examined 69 patients with IRD (CAD/IRD group) and 53 patients without IRD (CAD/non-IRD) referred to coronary artery bypass grafting, and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD serum PTX3 level in the CAD/IRD group was 1.96 +/- 0.98 ng/ml; this was statistically significantly higher than that of the CAD/non-IRD (1.41 +/- 0.74 ng/ml) and healthy control (1.21 +/- 0.59 ng/ml) groups. In contrast to most other IRDs, serum PTX3 levels were relatively low in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other systemic connective tissue diseases. In sex- and age-adjusted analysis, IRD, acute coronary syndromes, and low alcohol intake were associated with higher serum PTX3 levels. CONCLUSION: CAD patients with IRD had higher mean serum PTX3 levels than patients without IRD and healthy controls. In addition, acute coronary syndromes and low alcohol intake independently predicted higher serum PTX3 levels. Higher serum PTX3 levels in IRD may be related to the higher cardiovascular risk of IRD patients. Circulating PTX3 could likely be used as a biomarker for severity of cardiovascular disease in IRDs; its importance, however, might be limited in SLE and related disorders.",M2
20388043,"Skin fluorescence correlates strongly with coronary artery calcification severity in type 1 diabetes.BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is more severe and occurs at an earlier age in type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for this subclinical marker of atherosclerotic burden, like coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) itself, are not fully identified. One postulated mechanism for the increased CAC observed in type 1 diabetes is the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). As certain collagen AGEs fluoresce, skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF) can act as a novel marker of levels of collagen AGEs. We thus sought to determine the relationship between skin intrinsic fluorescence and CAC in type 1 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred five participants in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood-onset (age &lt;17 years) type 1 diabetes who had previously undergone electron beam tomography scanning for CAC (80 of whom had follow-up data) had SIF measurements taken using the SCOUT DM (VeraLight, Inc., Albuquerque, NM). Mean age and diabetes' duration were 49 and 40 years, respectively, at the time of SIF measurement. RESULTS: Seventy-one percent of the study participants had some measurable CAC that was univariately (but not after age adjustment) cross-sectionally associated with SIF (odds ratio = 2.51, 1.37-4.59). However, for CAC severity using natural logarithmically transformed scores, SIF was both univariately (P &lt; 0.0001) and multivariably (P = 0.03) associated with CAC. This relationship was independent of age, a history of CAD, renal function, or renal damage. Receiver operator characteristic analyses revealed that the discriminative ability of SIF to detect CAC went from an area under the curve of 71% for the presence of any CAC to 85% for those with a CAC score &gt;400. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between SIF and CAC appears stronger with more severe calcification. Given the strong relationship of CAC with CAD this finding has important implications and suggests that SIF maybe a useful marker of CAC/CAD risk and potentially a therapeutic target.",M2
20386243,"Randomized trials of nursing interventions for secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure: systematic review.OBJECTIVE: This systematic review of recent randomized trials was conducted to determine if cardiovascular nursing interventions improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and/or heart failure. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of nursing interventions in patients with CAD or heart failure published from January 2000 to December 2008 were eligible. Pilot studies and trials with greater than 25% attrition with no intention-to-treat analyses were excluded. Study characteristics and results were extracted and trials were graded for methodological quality. RESULTS: A total of 2,039 citations from electronic databases were identified; 55 articles were eligible for inclusion. The primary intervention strategy was education plus behavioral counseling and support (65% of interventions) using a combination of intervention modes. More than half of the trials (57%) reported statistically significant results in at least 1 outcome of blood pressure, lipids, physical activity, dietary intake, cigarette smoking, weight loss, healthcare utilization, mortality, quality of life, and psychosocial outcomes. However, there were no consistent relationships observed between intervention characteristics and the effects of interventions. The average measure of study quality was 2.8 (possible range, 0-4, with higher score equaling higher quality). CONCLUSION: Most trials reviewed demonstrated a beneficial impact of nursing interventions for secondary prevention in patients with CAD or heart failure.

20382779,"Comparison between surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity and resistance, and the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp in urban South African blacks with and without coronary artery disease.Coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are increasing in urban black South Africans during their transition from a rural to a western lifestyle. Insulin resistance is associated with CAD and DM. Fasting-based indices [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR), log HOMA IR, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)] were calculated and their correlations with the glucose disposal rate (M) obtained from the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp were compared in 40 patients with CAD and 20 patients without CAD. Normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and DM were categorised using the oral glucose tolerance test. M and QUICKI were lower in patients with CAD (p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.02); HOMA IR and log HOMA IR were higher (p&lt;0.02). M and QUICKI decreased and HOMA IR and log HOMA IR increased progressively across the NGT, IGT and DM categories in patients with and without CAD. Glucose concentrations increased across the glucose tolerance categories in patients with CAD (p&lt;0.001) and without CAD (p&lt;0.01). Linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between M and log HOMA IR (r=-0.3412; p&lt;0.02) and QUICKI (r=0.4078; p&lt;0.003), and between waist circumference (WC) and log HOMA IR (r=0.4637) and QUICKI (r=-0.4680) both p&lt;0.001. We concluded that patients with CAD were more insulin resistant than patients without CAD. As glucose tolerance declined, insulin resistance worsened. Log HOMA IR and QUICKI were comparable to the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp and these surrogate indices provided a valid method to estimate insulin sensitivity/resistance in our patients.",M2

METHODS: Five hundred and thirty six CAD patients and 544 age and ethnic matched controls of Chinese Han population were recruited from Qilu Hospital, Shandong University. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to genotype the selected single nucleotide polymorphism. Distributions of genotypic and allelic frequencies were analyzed by Chi-square test. RESULTS: The distribution of genotypic and allelic frequencies have no significant differences between the CAD cases and controls(P&gt; 0.05), even after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, when substratification analysis of the involved coronary artery vessels was performed, significant difference was found between single-vessel and triple-vessel (P= 0.02, OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.08-2.26) involvement.

Although Lp-PLA(2) activity was univariately predictive of CAD (HR=1.54 per SD, p=0.009), this relationship was not significant after covariate adjustment (p=0.59). There was a significant interaction between Lp-PLA(2) and CRP (p=0.02), i.e. those with both markers greater than the median level were more likely to have a CAD event than those persons with low levels of both (HR=2.89, p=0.06). When stratified by haptoglobin genotype, Lp-PLA(2) was predictive of CAD in persons with the 2/1 (HR=2.40, p=0.05), but not 2/2 (HR=0.66, p=0.27), genotype.

The present study was designed to explore the relation of plasma levels of MCP-1 to disease pathology in type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) patients. Fasting plasma venous samples were taken from 162 subjects divided into four groups: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CAD (n=41), type 2 diabetes patients without CAD (n=50), CAD patients with no history of diabetes (n=41) and healthy controls (n=30). Coronary risk factors such as body mass index, percentage body fat, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure and physical activity were measured using standard procedures. Plasma MCP-1 was quantitatively estimated by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Significant differences were observed for MCP-1 levels, percent body fat, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure amongst the groups. MCP-1 concentration was significantly correlated with diabetes duration (p&lt;0.001), body mass index (p&lt;0.01), waist/hip ratio (p&lt;0.01), systolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.01), percentage body fat (p&lt;0.01) and physical activity level (p&lt;0.001).

20368215,"Is glycaemia or insulin dose the stronger risk factor for coronary artery disease in type 1 diabetes?Although coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) is the leading cause of death in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the mechanisms responsible for the greatly increased risk are poorly understood. In particular, the role of glycaemic control is controversial with one study suggesting it predicts CAD mortality but not incidence. In this analysis, of the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study cohort of T1D, we examine whether risk factors differ for CAD morbidity and mortality, with a specific focus on HbA1c and insulin dose. Participants (n=592) were followed for 18 years for incident non-fatal and fatal CAD. Cox stepwise regression was used to determine the independent risk factors for non-fatal and fatal CAD. Mean age and diabetes duration at study baseline were 29 and 20 years, respectively. There were 109 incident non-fatal and 48 fatal CAD events. Baseline HbA(1C) was an independent risk factor for fatal CAD, along with duration of diabetes and albuminuria. In contrast, baseline lower insulin dose was strongly predictive of non-fatal CAD, as was lower renal function, higher diastolic blood pressure, and lipids. HbA(1C) predicts CAD mortality while lower insulin dose and standard CAD risk factors predict CAD morbidity.",M2
20368195,"A gluco-metabolic risk index with cardiovascular risk stratification potential in patients with coronary artery disease.The primary objective of this study was to classify patients with <e>CAD</e> as regards their gluco-metabolic state by easily available clinical variables. A secondary objective was to explore if it was possible to identify CAD patients at a high cardiovascular risk due to metabolic perturbations. The 1,867 patients with CAD were gluco-metabolically classified by an OGTT. Among these, 990 patients had complete data regarding all components of the metabolic syndrome, BMI, HbA1c and medical history. Only FPG and HDL-c adjusting for age significantly impacted OGTT classification. Based on these variables, a neural network reached a cross-validated misclassification rate of 37.8% compared with OGTT. By this criterion, 1,283 patients with complete one-year follow-up concerning all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke (CVE) were divided into low- and high-risk groups within which CVE were, respectively, 5.1 and 9.4% (p=0.016).Adjusting for confounding variables the relative risk for a CVE based on the neural network was 2.06 (95% CI: 1.18-3.58) compared with 1.37 (95% CI: 0.79-2.36) for OGTT.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 54 patients with CAD and atorvastatin treatment and 54 CAD patients without atorvastatin therapy, expression of CD40L, CD11a, CD11b, CD54, CD62L and CD41 on leukocytes was measured using flow cytometry. All patients were normocholesterolemic. RESULTS: Atorvastatin treatment led to a significantly lower expression of CD40L, CD11b and CD54 on monocytes (p&lt;0.05) and neutrophils (p&lt;0.05). Expression of CD11a was significantly lower on monocytes (p&lt;0.05) in atorvastatin-treated patients.

This study aimed to investigate the short-term effect of WBPA on coronary flow reserve (CFR) through transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) in healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). METHODS: This study consisted of 15 healthy subjects and 20 patients with CAD who underwent CFR examination before and immediately after WBPA. The flow velocity in the distal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was measured with TTDE at baseline and during adenosine infusion. Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to basal mean diastolic flow velocity. RESULTS: The WBPA treatment was completed in all 35 subjects without complications. There were no significant differences in heart rate and systolic blood pressure before and after WBPA. Whole body periodic acceleration increased CFR from 3.3 +/- 1.0 to 3.7 +/- 1.1 in the 35 subjects (P &lt; .001). Coronary angiography showed significant LAD narrowing in 8 of the 20 CAD patients, but WBPA increased CFR from 2.4 +/- 0.4 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 in them as well (P &lt; .01).

Monoclonal antibody 2.G2.H9, specific for the unique carboxyl terminal peptide of the fibrinogen gamma' chain, was used as capture antibody. Sheep antihuman fibrinogen/horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used for detection, with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. We evaluated the linearity, imprecision, analytical specificity, and lower limit of quantification of the assay. We determined the reference interval for gamma' fibrinogen in healthy individuals from the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 2879) and quantified associations between gamma' fibrinogen and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The sensitivity and specificity of gamma' fibrinogen in evaluating CAD patients (n = 133) was determined with ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: The gamma' fibrinogen ELISA had within-run CVs of 13.4% at 0.127 g/L and 4.8% at 0.416 g/L. The limit of quantification at an imprecision of 20% was 0.10 g/L. The reference interval for healthy individuals was 0.088-0.551 g/L. ROC curve analysis of results from patients with CAD yielded an area under the curve of 0.76, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.78 at a decision threshold of 0.30 g/L.

The role of genetic factors in susceptibility to coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the possible association between R219K gene polymorphism and coronary artery disease in an Iranian adult population. A total of 207 consecutive patients with CAD (group A) and 94 patients without CAD (group B) were studied. We determined the presence of the R219K variant in the ABCA1 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction analysis in 301 patients with and without CAD. The distribution of genotypes among the 2 groups was significantly different (P=0.009). In univariate analysis (with genotype AA as reference), the GG genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD (P=0.002; odds ratio [OR]=2.761; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.418-5.374), but the GA genotype did not show a significant association (P=0.234) (data not shown). A multivariate logistic regression analysis (using sex as clinically significant variable, and using age, diabetes mellitus, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein [HDL], smoking, body mass index [BMI], and genotype as statistically significant variables) was used to determine independent associations and adjusted ORs. The GG genotype (compared with the AA genotype) was an independent predictor of CAD (OR=2.856, 95% CI=1.307-6.241; P=0.009), followed by BMI (P=0.034; OR=1.100; 95% CI=1.007-1.200).

20234302,"Respiratory stress response: a novel diagnostic method for detection of significant coronary artery disease from finger pulse wave analysis during brief respiratory exercise.INTRODUCTION: Respiratory maneuvers can uncover manifestations of myocardial ischemia. Some pulse wave characteristics are associated with significant coronary artery disease (S-<e>CAD</e>). An innovative test using the respiratory stress response (RSR) has been developed for the detection of S-CAD based on spectral analysis of finger pulse wave oscillations measured using photoplethysmography (PPG) during deep, paced breathing at a rate of 6 breaths per minute (0.1 Hz) for 70 seconds. We evaluated this test (RSR) as an indicator of S-CAD. METHODS: The study consisted of 2 stages--feasibility and validation--assessing RSR in patients referred for coronary angiography. RSR was calculated by proprietary software analysis of the relative spectral power of the respiratory peak area at 0.1 Hz. The coronary angiograms were analyzed visually (stage I) and by quantitative coronary angiography (stage II) by 1 cardiologist blinded to the RSR results. S-CAD was defined as luminal stenosis &gt;70% of at least 1 coronary artery or LM stenosis &gt;50%. RESULTS: A total of 193 consecutive patients (stage I: 98 and stage II: 95) with a mean age of 63.2 +/- 11.9 years, 70% men, 112 (58%) with S-CAD, were included. S-CAD patients had significantly lower RSR compared with patients without S-CAD, P &lt; 0.001. RSR yielded a sensitivity of 83% (95% confidence interval = 75-90) and specificity of 70% (95% confidence interval = 59-80) for indicating S-CAD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for risk factors, showed that RSR is a strong independent indicator of S-CAD [OR = 18.9 (7.2-49.5), P &lt; 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Reduced RSR is an accurate noninvasive indicator of S-CAD.",M2

This study looked retrospectively at the prognosis of CAD in hypertensive patients with CAD who had undergone a coronary angiograph, had been given a CCB (benidipine [n = 66], amlodipine [n = 45], or long-acting nifedipine [n = 31]) on hospital discharge and were then followed up for a mean +/- SD of 5.2 +/- 2.9 years. Systolic/diastolic blood pressure for all 142 patients decreased significantly from a mean +/- SD of 137 +/- 20/74 +/- 15 mmHg to 129 +/- 20/71 +/- 12 mmHg. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 15 patients. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was a significant risk factor for MACE (hazard ratio 2.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.45, 3.80).

Fifty-six patients with type 2 diabetes and CAD were randomized to receive either rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) or a control for 12 weeks. The coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was assessed using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography at baseline and after 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of rosiglitazone treatment, plasma levels of C-reactive protein were significantly decreased and the median CFVR was significantly increased compared with baseline levels and compared with the control group. These results suggest that, in addition to its beneficial metabolic effects, rosiglitazone, via its anti-inflammatory effects, may improve endothelial function of the coronary arteries in patients with diabetes and CAD.",M2
20230787,"The peripheral blood mononuclear cell microRNA signature of coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are being used in the oncology field to characterize tumors and predict the survival of cancer patients. Here, we explored the potential of microRNAs as biomarkers for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and acute coronary syndromes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using real-time PCR-based profiling, we determined the microRNA signature of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from stable and unstable CAD patients and unaffected controls. 129 of 157 microRNAs measured were expressed by PBMCs and low variability between separate PBMC pools was observed. The presence of CAD in general coincided with a marked 5-fold increase (P&lt;0.001) in the relative expression level of miR-135a, while the expression of miR-147 was 4-fold decreased (P&lt;0.05) in PBMCs from CAD patients as compared to controls, resulting in a 19-fold higher miR-135a/miR-147 ratio (P&lt;0.001) in CAD. MicroRNA/target gene/biological function linkage analysis suggested that the change in PBMC microRNA signature in CAD patients is probably associated with a change in intracellular cadherin/Wnt signaling. Interestingly, unstable angina pectoris patients could be discriminated from stable patients based upon their relatively high expression level of a cluster of three microRNAs including miR-134, miR-198, and miR-370, suggesting that the microRNA signatures can be used to identify patients at risk for acute coronary syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to show that microRNA signatures can possibly be utilized to identify patients exhibiting atherosclerotic CAD in general and those at risk for acute coronary syndromes. Our findings highlight the importance of microRNAs signatures as novel tool to predict clinical disease outcomes.",M2

20229898,"Nonlinear registration of serial coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for assessment of changes in atherosclerotic plaque.PURPOSE: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a high-resolution three-dimensional imaging technique for the evaluation of coronary arteries in suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). Coregistration of serial CCTA scans would allow precise superimposition of images obtained at two different points in time, which could aid in recognition of subtle changes and precise monitoring of coronary plaque progression or regression. To this end, the authors aimed at developing a fully automatic nonlinear volume coregistration for longitudinal CCTA scan pairs. METHODS: The algorithm combines global displacement and local deformation using nonlinear volume coregistration with a volume-preserving constraint. Histogram matching of intensities between two serial scans is performed prior to nonlinear coregistration with dense nonparametric local deformation in which sum of squared differences is used as a similarity measure. The approximate segmentation of coronary arteries obtained from commercially available software provides initial anatomical landmarks for the coregistration algorithm that help localize and emphasize the structure of interest. To avoid possible bias caused by incorrect segmentation, the authors convolve the Gaussian kernel with the segmented binary coronary tree mask and define an extended weighted region of interest. A multiresolution approach is employed to represent coarse-to-fine details of both volumes and the energy function is optimized using a gradient descent method. The authors applied the algorithm in ten paired CCTA datasets (20 scans in total) obtained within 10.7 +/- 5.7 months from each other on a dual source CT scanner to monitor progression of CAD. RESULTS: Serial CCTA coregistration was successful in 9/10 cases as visually confirmed. The global displacement and local deformation of target registration error obtained from four anatomical landmarks were 2.22 +/- 1.15 and 1.56 +/- 0.74 mm, respectively, and the inverse consistency error of local deformation was 0.14 +/- 0.06 mm. The observer variability between two expert observers was 1.31 +/- 0.91 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed coregistration algorithm demonstrates potential to accurately register serial CCTA scans, which may allow direct comparison of calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque changes between the two scans.",M2
20229159,"Antithrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease and with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a life-threatening disease. Patients with DM have a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to their non-diabetic counterparts.

Among oral antiplatelet agents (acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel), prasugrel has shown the highest efficacy in patients with DM and ACS. The use of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor inhibitors in diabetic subjects with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces adverse clinical events in a greater extent than in non-diabetics. Several direct and indirect antithrombins are recommended for the treatment of ACS such as unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and bivalirudin.

METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study among 200 consecutive patients admitted with ACS at Tabba Heart Institute, Karachi from June to December 2008. The TIMI risk score was stratified on seven standard variables. The extent of CAD was evaluated on angiography and significant CAD was defined as &gt; or =70% stenosis in any one of the three major epicardial vessels. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 58.53 +/- 10.64 years. Out of 200 patients, there were 142 (71%) patients with TIMI score &lt; or =4 (low and intermediate TIMI risk score) and 58 (29%) patients with TIMI score &gt;4 (high TIMI risk score).

METHODS: Baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c (%)were measured in 426 patients with known or suspected stable CAD, who underwent coronary artery intravascular ultrasound(IVUS) at baseline and after a mean follow-up period of 664 days (range 257 to 961). The patients were categorised as normoglycaemic (n=226, 53%), or as having impaired fasting glucose (n=118, 28%) or diabetes (n=82, 19%). RESULTS: The maximum percentage coronary atheroma area at baseline was greater in diabetic patients (73.33+/-8.86%) than in those with normoglycaemia (69.08+/-10.43%; p=0.001) and impaired fasting glucose (69.32+/-9.59%; p=0.0031). In averaged IVUS measurements of the 30-mm target segment(n=332 participants), change in percentage atheroma area during follow-up was also greater in the diabetes (1.86+/-3.90%) than in other groups (0.28+/-3.32% and 0.56+/-2.96%,p=0.0047 global). FBG correlated with maximum percentage atheroma area at baseline (r=0.17; p=0.0003). HbA1c also correlated with maximum percentage atheroma area at baseline (r=0.26; p=0.0001) and with change in maximum plaque area (r=0.16; p=0.016). A similar pattern of results occurred with plaque volume. The relationships between diabetes or HbA1c and both IVUS measurements of plaque burden and remodelling persisted after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and the presence of diabetes are associated with the severity and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. These observations support the hypothesis that better glycaemic control may favourably influence CAD in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance or diabetes.",M2

BACKGROUND: Although a normal CAC scan signifies absence of significant atherosclerosis and is used to identify individuals at low clinical risk, the  warranty period  of a normal CAC scan relative to its ability to predict sustained absence of coronary atherosclerosis remains unknown. METHODS: We assessed frequency of and time to progression, as well as proportional increase of CAC in 422 individuals with normal CAC scan (CAC = 0) undergoing annual CAC scanning for 5 years. Results were compared with those of a referent cohort of 621 individuals with baseline CAC scan (CAC &gt;0). RESULTS: A total of 106 (25.1%) patients with CAC = 0 developed CAC during follow-up at a mean time to conversion of 4.1 +/- 0.9 years. Incidence of conversion to CAC &gt;0 was nonlinear and was highest in the fifth year. In multivariable analysis, progression to CAC &gt;0 was associated with age, diabetes, and smoking (p &lt; 0.01 for all).

Among propensity score-matched individuals with CAC &gt;0 versus CAC = 0, baseline CAC &gt;0 emerged as the strongest predictor of CAC progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.31 to 16.77), followed by diabetes (HR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.90) and smoking (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.63, p &lt; 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CAC = 0, conversion to CAC &gt;0 is nonlinear and occurs at low frequency before 4 years. No clinical factor seems to mandate earlier repeat CAC scanning.",M2
20218140,"Association of breast artery calcification with coronary artery disease and carotid intima-media thickness in premenopausal women.ABSTRACT This study investigated whether breast arterial calcification (BAC) has an association with coronary artery diseases (<e>CAD</e>) in young premenopausal women and evaluated the association of BAC with carotid intima-media thickness and standard CAD risk factors. Among 84 premenopausal women aged &lt; 55 years who were referred for coronary angiography, 34 (40.5%) had abnormal angiographic findings and 6 (7.1%) showed BAC in their mammograms. The body mass index of patients with BAC was significantly higher than those without BAC. BAC had no significant association with angiography-confirmed CAD.",M2
20215811,"T-786C polymorphism in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in a Chinese population.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many investigations have revealed that genetic influences can have an important impact on the incidence and progression of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). The aim of this research was to discover whether the T-786C polymorphism in the promoter 5'-flanking region of the gene for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is associated with CAD. METHODS: 622 Chinese Han subjects were enrolled in this case-control study. 312 had CAD confirmed by coronary angiography and 310 were healthy controls. Total genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotype at position -786 of the eNOS gene determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The allelic frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The minor allele frequency of the T-786C polymorphism was higher in the CAD group than in controls: after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, plasma glucose and presence of hypertension, the odds ratio for the risk of CAD in T-786C allele carriers was 1.739 (1.215-2.490) in comparison to individuals without the minor allele. In a stratified analysis, the association between T-786C genotype and CAD risk was greater in men, individuals &gt; or =60 years of age, smokers, hypertensives and subjects with a body mass index &gt; or =25. The T-786C polymorphism was associated with higher total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in control but not in CAD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The T-786C polymorphism of the eNOS gene appears to be an independent risk factor for CAD in Chinese Hans. This finding requires confirmation in prospective studies and in studies of other populations.",M2
20211319,"Prognostic value of an exaggerated exercise blood pressure response in patients with diabetes mellitus and known or suspected coronary artery disease.The prognostic value of an exaggerated exercise systolic blood pressure response (EESBPR) remains controversial. Our aim was to assess whether an EESBPR is associated with the long-term outcome in patients with diabetes mellitus and known or suspected coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). From an initial population of 22,262 patients with known or suspected CAD who underwent treadmill exercise electrocardiography or exercise echocardiography at our institution, 2,591 patients with a history of diabetes mellitus were selected for the present study. EESBPR was defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;220 mm Hg during exercise. The end points were all-cause mortality and hard events (ie, death or myocardial infarction). A total of 236 patients (9.1%) developed an EESBPR during the tests. During a mean follow-up of 6.5 +/- 3.9 years, 484 patients died and 646 experienced hard events. The 10-year mortality rate was 16.6% in patients with an EESBPR compared to 30.9% in those without an EESBPR (p &lt;0.001). The 10-year hard event rate was also lower in patients with an EESBPR (23.2% vs 38.9% in patients without an EESBPR; p &lt;0.001). On multivariate analysis, an EESBPR remained independently associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.78, p = 0.001) and hard events (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.79; p &lt;0.001). These results remained consistent in the subgroup of patients without a known history of CAD. In conclusion, an EESBPR was associated with improved survival and a lower rate of death or myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus and known or suspected CAD.",M2
20211318,"Comparison of usefulness of exercise testing versus coronary computed tomographic angiography for evaluation of patients suspected of having coronary artery disease.In patients suspected of having coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>), we compared the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of exercise testing using ST-segment changes alone and ST-segment changes, angina pectoris, and hemodynamic variables compared to coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Quantitative invasive coronary angiography was the reference method (&gt;50% coronary lumen reduction). A positive exercise test was defined as the development of significant ST-segment changes (&gt; or =1 mV measured 80 ms from the J-point), and the occurrence of one or more of the following criteria: ST-segment changes &gt; or =1 mV measured 80 ms from the J-point, angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia (the occurrence of &gt; or =3 premature ventricular beats), and &gt; or =20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during the test. Positive results on CTA were defined as a coronary lumen reduction of &gt; or =50%. In 100 patients (61 +/- 9 years old, 50% men, and 29% prevalence of significant CAD), the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of exercise testing using ST-segment changes was 45% (95% confidence interval 53% to 87%) and 63% (95% confidence interval 61% to 84%), respectively. However, the inclusion of all test variables yielded a sensitivity of 72% (95% confidence interval 53% to 87%) and a specificity of 37% (95% confidence interval 26% to 49%). The diagnostic sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval 82% to 100%) and specificity of 80% (95% confidence interval 69% to 89%) for CTA, however, were superior to any of the exercise test analysis strategies. In conclusion, in patients suspected of having CAD, the diagnostic sensitivity of exercise testing significantly improves if all test variables are included compared to using ST-segment changes exclusively. Furthermore, the superior diagnostic performance of CTA for the detection and exclusion of significant CAD might favor CTA as the first-line diagnostic test in patients suspected of having CAD.",M2
20210837,"Worse blood pressure control in patients with cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease compared with coronary artery disease.OBJECTIVES: Poor blood pressure (BP) control is common amongst patients with symptomatic atherothrombotic disease. It is unclear whether BP control and management differ across atherothrombotic disease subtypes. METHODS: We analysed the baseline data of 44,984 patients with documented coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) only (n = 30,414), cerebrovascular disease (CVD) only (n = 11,359) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) only (n = 3211) from the international REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health Registry and investigated the impact of atherothrombotic disease subtype on BP control and use of antihypertensive drugs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with BP controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg) was higher in CAD (58.1%) than in CVD (44.8%) or PAD (38.9%) patients (P &lt; 0.001). Amongst patients with treated hypertension, CAD patients were more likely to have BP controlled than were CVD patients [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59-1.75] or PAD (OR = 2.30; 95% CI = 2.10-2.52). These differences were smaller in women than in men and decreased with age. Amongst treated patients, CAD patients were more likely to receive &gt; or =3-drug combination therapies than were CVD (OR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.64-1.83) or PAD (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.49-1.80) patients. Adjustment for age, gender, waist obesity, diabetes, education level and world region did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery disease patients are more likely than CVD or PAD patients to have BP controlled and to receive antihypertensive drugs, particularly combination therapies. Promotion of more effective BP control through combination antihypertensive therapies could improve secondary prevention and therefore prevent complications in CVD and PAD patients.",M2
20210775,"The role of vascular endothelial growth factor gene as the genetic marker of atherothrombotic disorders and in the gene therapy of coronary artery disease.Many human diseases are characterized by vasculature disorders. Out of the many players in the angiogenic network, the vascular endothelial growth genes are by far the best characterized. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and in its complication, the acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Several common polymorphisms in the promoter region of the VEGF gene have been reported, but only few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been demonstrated to be associated with variations in VEGF serum concentrations and with a susceptibility to CAD and its complications-acute coronary syndromes. Moreover, the -634 C/G VEGF SNP (rs2010963) has been demonstrated to be associated with AMI and the development of heart failure after AMI. Gene-based therapy for patients with refractory CAD has been the subject of extensive investigation. Preclinical studies have shown promise for the delivery of VEGF gene for treating CAD, whereas the results of randomized placebo-controlled trials have not demonstrated unequivocal evidence of efficacy. To conclude, at present the role of VEGF and VEGF SNPs in pathogenesis of AMI and the development of heart failure after AMI is still uncertain and remains to be determined. Obviously, larger studies as well as functional studies are needed to confirm the role of VEGF SNPs in AMI and its complications after AMI.",M2
20208382,"Effects of phase III cardiac rehabilitation on mortality and cardiovascular events in elderly patients with stable coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has numerous benefits, including reduction of mortality and cardiovascular events, in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). However, the long-term effect of phase III CR in elderly patients with stable CAD is still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 111 elderly male CAD patients (&gt;or=65 years), including 37 subjects participating in supervised CR for 6 months and 74 age-matched controls, were analyzed. The patients were followed for up to 3,500 days, until the occurrence of death or 1 of the following major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, refractory angina requiring revascularization, admission for congestive heart failure, or stroke. All-cause mortality tended to be lower in the CR group than in the Control group (14% vs 28%, P=0.081). The MACE incidence was significantly lower in the CR group than in the Control group (30% vs 62%, P=0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the MACE incidence was significantly lower in the CR group than in the Control group [adjusted hazard ratio 0.43 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.91), P=0.027]. CONCLUSIONS: Phase III CR has the beneficial effect of reducing cardiovascular events even in elderly patients with stable CAD.",M2
20207271,"Coronary artery disease in patients with peripheral artery disease.OBJECTIVES: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic disease associated with cardiovascular risk factors, and with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study sought to assess the prevalence of angiographic coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>), and to determine the predictive value of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on the presence of CAD in patients with PAD of the lower extremities. METHODS: In total, 231 patients who presented at hospital complaining of intermittent claudication were included. All patients underwent simultaneous peripheral and cardiac angiography. Age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and lipid values were recorded. RESULTS: The coronary angiograms of 64 (28%) patients were within normal limits, and 167 (72%) patients manifested CAD. Logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension and diabetes were independent predictors for the presence of CAD or PAD. CONCLUSION: Aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension and diabetes, in PAD is critically important in reducing mortality and morbidity.",M2
20204992,"Predicting short and long-term exercise intentions and behaviour in patients with coronary artery disease: A test of protection motivation theory.The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of protection motivation theory (PMT) in the prediction of exercise intentions and behaviour in the year following hospitalisation for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). Patients with documented CAD (n = 787), recruited at hospital discharge, completed questionnaires measuring PMT's threat (i.e. perceived severity and vulnerability) and coping (i.e. self-efficacy, response efficacy) appraisal constructs at baseline, 2 and 6 months, and exercise behaviour at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-hospitalisation. Structural equation modelling showed that the PMT model of exercise at 6 months had a good fit with the empirical data. Self-efficacy, response efficacy, and perceived severity predicted exercise intentions, which, in turn predicted exercise behaviour. Overall, the PMT variables accounted for a moderate amount of variance in exercise intentions (23%) and behaviour (20%). In contrast, the PMT model was not reliable for predicting exercise behaviour at 12 months post-hospitalisation. The data provided support for PMT applied to short-term, but not long-term, exercise behaviour among patients with CAD. Health education should concentrate on providing positive coping messages to enhance patients' confidence regarding exercise and their belief that exercise provides health benefits, as well as realistic information about disease severity.",M2
20204639,"Image fusion of coronary CT angiography and cardiac perfusion MRI: a pilot study.OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool for the image fusion of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). METHODS: Surface representations and volume-rendered images from fused CTCA/CMR data of five patients with significant coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) on CTCA and perfusion deficits on CMR were generated using a newly developed software prototype. The spatial relationship of significant coronary artery stenosis at CTCA and myocardial defects at CMR was evaluated. RESULTS: Registration of CTCA and CMR images was possible in all patients. The comprehensive three-dimensional visualisation of fused CTCA and CMR data accurately demonstrated the relationship between coronary artery stenoses and myocardial defects in all patients. CONCLUSION: The introduced tool enables image fusion of CTCA and CMR data sets and allows for correct superposition of the coronary arteries derived from CTCA onto the corresponding myocardial segments derived from CMR. The method facilitates the comprehensive assessment of the functionally relevant CAD by the exact allocation of culprit coronary stenoses to corresponding myocardial defects at a low radiation dose.",M2
20202518,"Prognostic value of 64-slice cardiac computed tomography severity of coronary artery disease, coronary atherosclerosis, and left ventricular ejection fraction.OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the prognostic and incremental value of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) severity, coronary atherosclerosis, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured with cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA). BACKGROUND: CTA is an emerging tool used for the detection of obstructive CAD. However, there are limited data supporting the prognostic value of 64-slice CTA and its ability to predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events such as cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. METHODS: Consecutive patients (without history of revascularization, heart transplantation, and congenital heart disease) were prospectively enrolled. Each CTA was evaluated for CAD severity, total plaque score, and LVEF. Patients were followed, and all events were confirmed with death certificates or hospital or physician records and reviewed by a clinical events committee. RESULTS: Between February 2006 and February 2008, 2,076 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled and followed for a mean of 16 +/- 8 months. At follow-up, a total of 31 (1.5%) patients had cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction and 47 (2.3%) had all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Multivariate analysis showed that CAD severity (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89 to 4.83) was a predictor of major adverse cardiac events and that LVEF (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.86) had incremental value over CAD severity. Total plaque score had incremental value over CAD severity and LVEF for all-cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: Using CTA, CAD severity, LVEF, and total plaque score seems to have prognostic and incremental value over routine clinical predictors. Cardiac CTA seems to be a promising noninvasive modality with prognostic value.",M2
20202511,"The present state of coronary computed tomography angiography a process in evolution.In the past 5 years since the introduction of 64-detector row cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), there has been an exponential growth in the quantity of scientific evidence to support the feasibility of its use in the clinical evaluation of individuals with suspected coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). Since then, there has been considerable debate as to where CCTA precisely fits in the algorithm of evaluation of individuals with suspected CAD. Proponents of CCTA contend that the quality and scope of the available evidence to date support the replacement of conventional methods of CAD evaluation by CCTA, whereas critics assert that clinical use of CCTA is not yet adequately proven and should be restricted, if used at all. Coincident with the scientific debate underlying the clinical utility of CCTA, there has developed a perception by many that the rate of growth in cardiac imaging is disproportionately high and unsustainable. In this respect, all noninvasive imaging modalities and, in particular, more newly introduced ones, have undergone a higher level of scrutiny for demonstration of clinical and economic effectiveness. We herein describe the latest available published evidence supporting the potential clinical and cost efficiency of CCTA, drawing attention not only to the significance but also the limitations of such studies. These points may trigger discussion as to what future studies will be both necessary and feasible for determining the exact role of CCTA in the workup of patients with suspected CAD.",M2
20200626,"Variation in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels over 24 hours in patients with stable coronary artery disease.Limited, controversial data exist regarding changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels over short times and the importance of detecting these changes in patients who have coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). We investigated the variation of hs-CRP levels and their association with the severity of CAD in patients with stable CAD.We measured morning, midday, evening, and midnight hs-CRP levels in 124 patients (94 with CAD, 30 with normal coronary arteries), who were evaluated via coronary angiography and Gensini scoring. Patients were divided into 3 groups (normal coronary arteries, mild CAD, or severe CAD) according to Gensini score.Temporal hs-CRP levels varied significantly--the highest mean concentrations were found in the morning, and the lowest concentrations at midday (P &lt;0.001). All temporal hs-CRP measurements and the absolute increase in hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with severe CAD (both P &lt;0.001). The most significant predictors of CAD severity were age (P=0.005), midday hs-CRP level (P &lt;0.001), and brain natriuretic peptide level (P=0.045). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that cutoff values of hs-CRP taken at different times predicted severe CAD with similar sensitivity and specificity. Different cutoff values for temporal hs-CRP levels correlated with the severity of CAD. Serum levels of hs-CRP varied over 24 hours, whether patients had CAD or normal coronary arteries.",M2
20195399,"Clinical value of serum uric Acid in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although increased serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations are commonly encountered in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>), the clinical value of SUA has not been established. METHODS: The study group comprised 687 consecutive patients with suspected CAD who had undergone coronary angiography. CAD was defined as stenosis &gt; or = 50% of the luminal diameter. CAD severity was expressed as 1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria, and aortofemoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was obtained by arterial catheterization invasively. RESULTS: In total, 395 patients had CAD. SUA was higher in patients with CAD as compared to those without CAD (5.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.0 mg/dL, p = 0.004). In addition, SUA was significantly associated with the severity of CAD (p = 0.002). However, after adjusting for significant confounding factors including age, diabetes, smoking, cholesterol, MS, and PWV, SUA was not an independent risk factor for CAD (p = 0.151). Based on a subgroup analysis, SUA was more closely associated with CAD in women than in men, and in the highest quartile (&gt; or = 6.4 mg/dL) than in the first quartile (&lt; 4.8 mg/dL); however, these results were not significant (p = 0.062, p = 0.075, respectively). In a multivariate regression analysis, the most important determinant of SUA was MS (i.e., insulin resistance syndrome), which is strongly associated with CAD. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected CAD, SUA was not an independent risk factor for CAD and may be merely a marker of insulin resistance.",M2
20191989,"[Coronary artery disease and cardiac ischemic disease: two different pathologies with different diagnostic procedures]Coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) remains the leading cause of death in the Western world, and early detection of CAD allows optimal therapeutic management. The gold standard has always been invasive coronary angiography, but over the years various non-invasive techniques have been developed to detect CAD, including cardiac SPECT and cardiac computed tomography (Cardiac CT). Cardiac SPECT permitted visualization of myocardial perfusion and have focused on the assessment of the hemodynamic consequences of obstructive coronary lesions as a marker of CAD. Cardiac CT focuses on the detection of atherosclerosis rather than ischemia, and permit detection of CAD at an earlier stage. Objectives of this manuscript are to discuss the clinical experience with both modalities and to provide a critical review of the strengths and limitations of Cardiac SPECT and Cardiac CT for the diagnostic and management of patients with suspected CAD or cardiac ischemic disease.",M2
20186990,"Peripheral arterial tonometry for risk stratification in men with coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) risk is not fully revealed by traditional risk factors. Identification of a simple, noninvasive tool that allows for detection of high-risk CAD patients and can be applied in large populations and clinical settings would prove valuable. HYPOTHESIS: We sought to test the hypothesis that peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) would be associated with residual risk in men with CAD. METHODS: In this study, finger PAT was used to measure pulse wave amplitude (PWA) during reactive hyperemia (RH) and taken as a measure of microvascular endothelial function in 42 men with stable CAD and well controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA(2)) were measured and used to reclassify men into high-risk (elevated hs-CRP and Lp-PLA(2)), moderate-risk (either elevated hs-CRP or Lp-PLA(2)), or low-risk (low hs-CRP and Lp-PLA(2)) groups. RESULTS: PWA-RH was significantly lower in the high-risk group (1.3 +/- 0.04) compared to the moderate-risk (1.6 +/- 0.07, P &lt; 0.05) and low-risk (2.0 +/- 0.1, P &lt; 0.05) groups. According to binary logistic regression, PWA-RH was a significant predictor of high-risk status among men with CAD (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Measurement of peripheral microvascular endothelial function with PAT may be able to distinguish high-risk men from moderate- and low-risk men with stable CAD and well-controlled LDL-C levels and thus aid in residual risk stratification in this at risk cohort.",M2
20185075,"A description of gender differences in angiographic findings in a single-center Iranian hospital.Coronary angiography is one of the most common hospital procedures, though there is limited information on the location and extent of coronary artery blockages other than for predominately White patients. This study examined the location and magnitude of coronary artery blockages in patients admitted to a leading tertiary heart hospital in Iran with symptoms of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). This retrospective descriptive study aimed to review angiography records of all patients with symptoms of CAD undergone diagnostic coronary angiography between February 2002 and September 2004. A total of 94 consecutive angiographic records were analyzed to determine the culprit coronary arteries and the severity of CAD. The findings of the study showed that double- vessel disease was the commonest type of CAD. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the most common culprit artery (84%), followed by RCA (64%), CX (37%), OM (13%) and LMS (3%). Our study showed a relatively high angiographic prevalence of LAD blockages. The results of this study provide additional support for the significance of ethnicity in the extent of coronary artery blockages.",M2
20180613,"Impact and clinical management of depression in patients with coronary artery disease.The rates of major adverse coronary events, including recurrent ischemic events and death, in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) have been shown to be significantly increased in patients with depression. In addition, health care costs are higher and health-related quality of life is lower in depressed patients with CAD. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed for the association of increased events seen in this population. Studies have focused on antidepressants (specifically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine), psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy), and a wide range of other nonpharmacologic interventions. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments are known to improve depressive symptoms in patients with CAD, but their effects on outcomes such as mortality and hospital admissions remain controversial. If treatment of depression is warranted, strategies should include sertraline or citalopram, with or without cognitive behavioral therapy, based on the known efficacy and safety of the drugs in this population. Nonpharmacologic therapy such as aerobic exercise has been shown to improve not only depression but also cardiovascular health. When selecting an appropriate antidepressant, clinicians should consider their patients' comorbid conditions and the potential for drug interactions, and treatment should be frequently monitored. Screening for depression in patients with cardiac disease should be instituted on a routine basis by using either case-finding or symptom-triggered approaches. Based on the high prevalence of depression and its known adverse effects in patients with CAD, future research is needed to help determine the role of antidepressants and nonpharmacologic strategies in improving outcomes in patients with both comorbidities.",M2
20178698,"Psoriasis: can statins play a dual role?Recently, a strong association between  psoriasis  and  atherosclerosis  has emerged. Psoriasis patients have an increased prevalence of atherosclerotic disease including coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular diseases. The exact connection between psoriasis and atherosclerosis remains unclear, but it is thought that inflammation, which plays an important role in both diseases, may be the causative link. Nevertheless, psoriasis patients suffer from an increased burden of atherosclerotic disease and most commonly die from  coronary artery disease  (<e>CAD</e>). Psoriatic patients have an increased prevalence of CAD risk factors and an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI). One CAD risk factor in psoriasis patients that can easily be managed is  hyperlipidemia.   Statins  are safe, cost-effective, and have been proven to be highly effective in preventing CAD, including MI, in patients with hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, in addition to their lipid lowering properties, statins have anti-inflammatory immunomodulator activities that may be beneficial in several autoimmune diseases including psoriasis. Considering the safety and cost-effectiveness of statins, we feel that it is worth investigating if statins can play a dual role in psoriasis by treating the increased atherosclerotic disease burden in these patients through their lipid lowering effects and by decreasing psoriatic disease activity through their anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory properties.",M2
20173736,"Targeted deletion of the 9p21 non-coding coronary artery disease risk interval in mice.Sequence polymorphisms in a 58-kilobase (kb) interval on chromosome 9p21 confer a markedly increased risk of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>), the leading cause of death worldwide. The variants have a substantial effect on the epidemiology of CAD and other life-threatening vascular conditions because nearly one-quarter of Caucasians are homozygous for risk alleles. However, the risk interval is devoid of protein-coding genes and the mechanism linking the region to CAD risk has remained enigmatic. Here we show that deletion of the orthologous 70-kb non-coding interval on mouse chromosome 4 affects cardiac expression of neighbouring genes, as well as proliferation properties of vascular cells. Chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) mice are viable, but show increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac expression of two genes near the non-coding interval, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b, is severely reduced in chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) mice, indicating that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in the non-coding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) aortic smooth muscle cells exhibited excessive proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that the CAD risk interval has a pivotal role in regulation of cardiac Cdkn2a/b expression, and suggest that this region affects CAD progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell proliferation.",M2
20173302,"Mycotic DNA in non-atherosclerotic aortic wall of coronary patients is associated with sICAM-1 expression.BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is currently being investigated as a chronic inflammatory process and the role of infectious agents is unclear. The presence of mycotic DNA in the wall of the non-atherosclerotic aorta of patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and its association with levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 expression was examined in the present study. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 40 patients with CAD and a comparative group of 20 patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) without CAD, specimens of the aortic wall were obtained during cardiac surgery. Mycotic DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a fungus-specific universal primer pair, ITS3 and ITS4, to amplify a portion of the 5.8S rDNA region, the entire ITS2 region and a portion of the 28S rDNA region, and using a species-specific primer pair, CALB1 and CALB2, to specifically amplify Candida (C.) albicans. The nested PCR method was performed to amplify the intergenic transcribed spacer regions of the rRNAs of Candida species. Before surgery the serum level of sICAM-1 was estimated. Mycotic DNA was detected in 48% of the CAD patients and in 40% of the AS patients, with C. albicans DNA in 58% and 100%, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In CAD patients with a high level of sICAM-1, C. albicans DNA was found more frequently than in patients without elevated levels of sICAM-1 (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mycotic DNA was found in the non-atherosclerotic aortic wall of CAD patients as well as in patients with AS. In the CAD patients C. albicans DNA was related to sICAM-1 expression.",M2
20172123,"Effect of concomitant coronary artery disease on procedural and late outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.BACKGROUND: Previous coronary artery bypass grafting increases predicted operative risk for conventional valve replacement, according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk algorithm. Additionally, the presence of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) has been demonstrated to increase procedural risk with conventional aortic valve replacement. Significant coexisting CAD requires preemptive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients under consideration for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study examined the impact of previous coronary artery bypass grafting or PCI on procedural outcomes and overall survival in patients having TAVI. METHODS: Two hundred and one high-risk patients were enrolled in two international feasibility studies from December 2005 to February 2008 for the treatment of aortic stenosis using TAVI. Thirty patients were excluded from analysis due to failure to successfully deploy the valve in the aortic annulus. Data were collected concurrently using an ad hoc database that included operative and long-term survival. Previous cardiovascular intervention prior to TAVI was used to identify the existence of concomitant CAD. Logistic regression along with Kaplan-Meier estimates were employed to establish the association between CAD and survival from TAVI. RESULTS: Overall mortality after TAVI was significantly higher among the CAD group (35.7%) in contrast with the non-CAD patients (18.4%), p = 0.01. Logistic regression analysis found that patients who had CAD were 10.1 times more likely to die (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 174.8) within 30 days of the procedure than those who did not. Proportional hazards analysis established that the risk of dying at any point in time was 2.3 times higher among the patients with CAD (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 4.17). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrate improved long-term survival among patients without CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting coronary artery disease negatively impacts procedural outcomes and long-term survival in patients undergoing TAVI, and implies that risk assessment and anticipated outcomes might be inaccurate due to stratification as isolated aortic valve replacement rather than AVR+CABG. Comparison of procedural outcomes, based on operative approach without controlling for unequal distribution of CAD in the cohorts, are likely invalid.",M2
20171906,"Decision analytic model for evaluation of suspected coronary disease with stress testing and coronary CT angiography.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to apply a decision analytic model for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) to define the optimal utilization of coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) and stress testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model tested in this study assumes that CAD is evaluated with a stress test and/or cCTA and that a patient with positive evaluation results undergoes cardiac catheterization. On the basis of values of sensitivity, specificity, and radiation dose from the published literature and test costs from the Medicare fee schedule, a decision tree model was constructed as a function of disease prevalence. RESULTS: The false-negative rate is lowest when cCTA is used as an isolated test. The false-positive rate is minimized when cCTA is used in combination with stress echocardiography. Effective radiation is minimized by use of stress electrocardiography or stress echocardiography alone or prior to cCTA. When the pretest probability of CAD is low, a strategy that uses stress echocardiography followed by cCTA minimizes the false-positive rate and effective radiation exposure, with relatively low imaging costs and with a false-negative rate only slightly higher than a strategy including stress myocardial scintigraphy. As the pretest probability of CAD increases above 20%, the false-negative rate of stress echocardiography followed by cCTA increases by &gt;5% relative to cCTA alone. CONCLUSION: Effective radiation dose and imaging costs for the workup of CAD may be minimized by an appropriate combination of stress testing and cCTA. A strategy that uses stress echocardiography followed by cCTA is most appropriate for the evaluation of low-risk patients with CAD with a pretest probability &lt; 20%, while cCTA alone may be more appropriate in intermediate-risk patients.",M2
20167181,"Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: the Indian scenario.Noncommunicable diseases, of which coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and diabetes top the list, have overtaken communicable diseases with respect to overall mortality, even in developing countries like India. High prevalence rates of diabetes and CAD are seen not only in affluent migrant Indians, but also in those living within the subcontinent. Indeed the epidemic of diabetes and CAD is now spreading to the middle- and lower-income groups in India. The risk for CAD is two to four times higher in diabetic subjects, and in Indians, CAD occurs prematurely, i.e., one to two decades earlier than in the West. Thus there is an urgent need for studies on CAD in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects in India. The Chennai Urban Population Study, a population-based study in Chennai, in South India, showed a prevalence of CAD of 11%, which is 10 times more than what it was in 1970. Clustering of risk factors for CAD such as hyperglycemia, central body obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension tends to occur, and interplay of these risk factors could explain the enhanced CAD risk in Indians. Additionally, low-grade inflammation and a possible inherent genetic susceptibility are other contributing factors. Preventive measures such as lifestyle modification with healthy diet, adequate physical activity, and decrease in stress could help prevent the twin epidemics of diabetes and CAD.",M2
20167083,"Fibrinogen beta variants confer protection against coronary artery disease in a Greek case-control study.BACKGROUND: Although plasma fibrinogen levels are related to cardiovascular risk, data regarding the role of fibrinogen genetic variation in myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) etiology remain inconsistent. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of fibrinogen A (FGA), fibrinogen B (FGB) and fibrinogen G (FGG) gene SNPs and haplotypes on susceptibility to CAD in a homogeneous Greek population. METHODS: We genotyped for rs2070022, rs2070016, rs2070006 in FGA gene, the rs7673587, rs1800789, rs1800790, rs1800788, rs1800787, rs4681 and rs4220 in FGB gene and for the rs1118823, rs1800792 and rs2066865 SNPs in FGG gene applying an arrayed primer extension-based genotyping method (APEX-2) in a sample of CAD patients (n = 305) and controls (n = 305). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), before and after adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: None of the FGA and FGG SNPs and FGA, FGB, FGG and FGA-FGG haplotypes was associated with disease occurrence after adjustment. Nevertheless, rs1800787 and rs1800789 SNPs in FGB gene seem to decrease the risk of CAD, even after adjustment for potential confounders (OR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026 and OR = 0.44, 95%CI:0.21-0.94, p = 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FGA and FGG SNPs as well as FGA, FGB, FGG and FGA-FGG haplotypes do not seem to be important contributors to CAD occurrence in our sample. On the contrary, FGB rs1800787 and rs1800789 SNPs seem to confer protection to disease onset lowering the risk by about 50% in homozygotes for the minor alleles.",M2
20160394,"Relationship between renal dysfunction and severity of coronary artery disease in Japanese patients.BACKGROUND: The relationship between renal dysfunction and the severity of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) was examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The severity of CAD in 572 patients was graded according to the number of stenotic coronary arteries, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was monitored for 3 years. Patients were stratified into 3 eGFR groups: normal (&gt;75 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2)), mild reduction (60-75) and chronic kidney disease (CKD: &lt;60). There were 161 patients in the CKD group. The average number of stenotic coronary arteries was larger in the CKD group than in the other groups (normal vs mild reduction vs CKD =1.35+/-0.07 (SE) vs 1.22+/-0.08 vs 1.69+/-0.08 vessel disease (VD), P&lt;0.001). During the 3-year follow-up, the renal function of 13.8% of the patients worsened. Those who showed more deterioration of eGFR had more severe CAD than those who did not (1.20+/-0.06 vs 1.61+/-0.06 VD, P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the severity of CAD was independently and significantly associated with the deterioration of eGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CKD had more severe CAD, which may explain the high rate of cardiovascular events in these patients. Moreover, the prognosis of renal function was poor in patients with severe CAD, and CAD was found to be an independent risk factor for worsening of renal dysfunction.",M2
20159623,"Relation of coronary artery plaque location to extent of coronary artery disease studied by computed tomographic angiography.BACKGROUND: Distal coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) is less amenable to surgery or stenting compared with proximal disease. However, little is known about the epidemiology of distal versus proximal CAD. METHODS: We determined the prevalence and factors associated with proximal, mid, and distally located plaque in the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries in 418 subjects without prior CAD history who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography for symptoms or stress test results. Clinical characteristics and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were also determined. RESULTS: Most subjects (88%) had plaque, but only 18% of plaques were associated with stenosis &gt;50%. In subjects with single-vessel plaque, only 7% had distal plaque, whereas 75% had proximal plaque. With 3-vessel plaque, 70% had distal and 100% had proximal plaques. Of subjects with a single location of plaque along a vessel, most had proximal plaque (69%); isolated distal-vessel plaque was rare (2%). Distal plaque was dominantly found in association with both proximal and mid plaque (88%). After multivariable adjustment for demographics, traditional, and nontraditional risk factors, both increasing number of vessels with plaque and clinically significant CAC scores were independently associated with higher odds of distal plaque, whereas associations of traditional risk factors were weaker. Distal plaque was independently associated with stenosis &gt; 50%. CONCLUSION: These data support the concept that early lesions are most often proximal and that CAC scoring may be a poor screening tool for detecting proximal disease. Furthermore, distal lesions are more associated with advanced disease than with traditional cardiovascular risk factors.",M2
20152229,"The effect of obesity on quality of life in patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). Because all 3 conditions may reduce quality of life, the extent to which obesity, diabetes, and CAD independently affect quality of life is uncertain. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and documented CAD participating in the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes trial at 45 clinical sites in the United States and Canada were studied in a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data. Quality of life was assessed with the Duke Activity Status Index, the energy/fatigue and health distress scales from the Medical Outcome Study, and overall self-rated health status. RESULTS: Higher body mass index was significantly associated with worse scores on all 4 quality of life scales, even after adjustment for the severity of diabetes and CAD and other comorbid conditions. Use of insulin, angina, and current smoking were also associated with significantly lower quality of life on all 4 scales, independent of other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with significantly reduced quality of life in patients with diabetes and CAD, independent of comorbid conditions.",M2
20152218,"Are quality improvements associated with the Get With the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease (GWTG-<e>CAD</e>) program sustained over time? A longitudinal comparison of GWTG-CAD hospitals versus non-GWTG-CAD hospitals.BACKGROUND: Previous reports have demonstrated that participation in GWTG-CAD, a national quality initiative of the American Heart Association, is associated with improved guideline adherence for patients hospitalized with CAD. We sought to establish whether these benefits from participation in GWTG-CAD were sustained over time. METHODS: We used the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare database to examine 6 performance measures and one composite score for 3 consecutive 12-month periods including aspirin and beta-blocker on arrival/discharge, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and adult smoking cessation counseling. The differences in guideline adherence between the GWTG-CAD hospitals (n = 440, 439, 429) and non-GWTG-CAD hospitals (n = 2,438, 2,268, 2,140) were evaluated for each 12-month period. A multivariate mixed-effects model was used to estimate the independent effect of GWTG-CAD over time adjusting for hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Compared with non-GWTG hospitals, the GWTG-CAD hospitals demonstrated higher guideline adherence for 6 performance measures. The largest differences existed for (1) aspirin at arrival (2.3%, 2.1%, and 1.6% for each 12-month period, respectively), (2) aspirin at discharge (3.4%, 2.2%, and 2.3%), (3) beta-blocker at arrival (3.4%, 2.9%, and 2.6%), and (4) beta-blocker at discharge (2.8%, 1.8%, and 1.5%). In multivariate analysis, the GWTG-CAD hospitals were independently associated with better adherence for 4 of the 6 measures (the exceptions were ACE-I for LVSD and smoking cessation counseling). Superior performance was also found for the composite measures. Although there was some narrowing between groups, GWTG-CAD hospitals maintained superior guideline adherence than non-GWTG-CAD hospitals for the entire 3-year period (adjusted differences 1.8%, 1.6%, and 1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals participating in GWTG-CAD had modestly superior acute cardiac care and secondary prevention measures performance relative to non-GWTG-CAD. These benefits of GWTG-CAD participation were sustained over time and independent of hospital characteristics.",M2
20151059,"Exposure to extreme cold lowers the ischemic threshold in coronary artery disease patients.BACKGROUND: Cold temperature is known to commonly precipitate angina pectoris in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). It was previously shown that the ischemic threshold was lower during exercise testing at -8 degrees C than at +20 degrees C in patients with a history of cold-induced angina, whereas it was unchanged in patients without cold-induced angina. Few data exist on the impact of more severe cold exposure on myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of extreme cold exposure (-20 degrees C) on the ischemic threshold among CAD patients. METHODS: Thirteen men with CAD and documented exercise-induced ischemia performed two treadmill exercise tests, one at +20 degrees C and one at -20 degrees C, in random order. Electrocardiograms were recorded every 30 s and analyzed separately in random order by two experienced readers blinded to temperature. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) time to ischemic electrical threshold was 53+/-60 s lower at -20 degrees C than at +20 degrees C (P=0.008), corresponding to a relative change of -8.0+/-10.5%. All other exercise parameters, including total exercise time and rate-pressure product, were unchanged during exposure to extreme cold. CONCLUSION: Exposure to extreme cold (-20 degrees C) lowers the ischemic threshold during exercise testing in patients with CAD, even if asymptomatic or without a history of cold-induced angina. Patients with CAD and evidence of exertional angina or myocardial ischemia wishing to perform exercise at extremely low temperatures should discuss this matter with their physicians.",M2
20145047,"Acromegaly per se does not increase the risk for coronary artery disease.CONTEXT: Information about the risk and course of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) in acromegaly is limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate CAD risk in acromegalic patients at diagnosis and after successful treatment during follow-up. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (age 45.1+/-10.6 years, 15 women) were studied at the time of diagnosis, and 19 patients were re-evaluated after 4.6+/-1.1 years. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) risk score was calculated, and a cardiac computed tomography was performed for detection and quantification (Agatston score (AS)) of coronary artery calcium (CACs). Fifty age-, sex-, and CAD risk-matched subjects and CAC data from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study served as controls. RESULTS: In 21 of the 25 patients, the 10-year risk of developing CAD according to the ESC risk score was low (&lt;10%) and high (&gt;20%) in four patients. The AS was lower than in controls (2.6+/-7.9 vs 66+/-182; P=0.014) and less patients had a positive CAC (AS&gt;0) (20 vs 48%, P=0.024), which in the acromegalic patients was less than expected from the HNR study. The AS did not correlate with GH excess or disease duration. In 19 acromegalic patients, who were in remission and re-evaluated after 4.6+/-1.1 years, the ESC risk (P=0.102) and the AS (P=0.173) did not change significantly and no symptomatic CAD event occurred. CONCLUSION: CAD risk in newly diagnosed acromegalic patients was low and remained stable after successful treatment. CAC was lower than in controls suggesting that GH excess per se does not carry an additional CAD risk.",M2
20143910,"The mitochondrial DNA variant 16189T&gt;C is associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in Saudi Arabs.By virtue of the functional role of the mitochondrion in energy and reactive oxygen species production, mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are potential candidates for cardiovascular-related disorders. Further, the mtDNA is extremely polymorphic and several diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been used to assort sequences into haplogroups with defined continental and regional ranges. However, the relevance of these haplogroups and mutations with respect to coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of the 16189T&gt;C variants and mtDNA haplogroups as predisposing factors for CAD in 669 Saudi patients with angiographically established disease compared with 258 disease-free controls. The 16189T&gt;C was associated with CAD (1.524 [1.076-2.159]; p = 0.017). However, this association was influenced by age as well as the presence of myocardial infarction and hypertension. Among the haplogroups, only the N1c showed a borderline protective relationship (p = 0.074) with CAD as an independent risk factor. This association turned significant in the total sample (0.176 [0.042-0.736]; p = 0.017) and in the &lt;50-year age group (0.075 [0.008-0.743]; p = 0.027), when included as a possible confounding factor. Our results suggested that the impact of mtDNA polymorphism on CAD manifestation is influenced by important confounders, particularly the presence of myocardial infarction, hypertension, and age.",M2
20135063,"Clopidogrel non-responsiveness and risk of cardiovascular morbidity. An updated meta-analysis.We performed this meta-analysis to update the clinical evidences on the relation between clopidogrel non-responsiveness and clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. An electronic literature search through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library and bibliographies of retrieved articles up to January, 2009 was conducted. Studies were included if they had a cohort prospective design, if they analysed clopidogrel responsiveness in CAD patients in relation to death and/or occurrence of adverse coronary events during follow-up, and if they reported an adequate statistical analysis. Fourteen studies, totalling 4,564 CAD patients followed for a time ranging from 14 days to one year, were included. The cumulative analysis reported that residual platelet reactivity despite clopidogrel treatment was significantly associated with an increased risk of death and/or thrombotic recurrences (odds ratio [OR] 5.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.97 to 10.84; p&lt;0.00001). However, four studies contributed to a consistent heterogeneity of the model and evidenced a significant risk of publication bias, so were excluded from the analysis. This exclusion, however, did not influence the overall result, by confirming the increased risk of cardiovascular recurrences for patients with a poor response to clopidogrel treatment (OR 3.58, 95%CI 2.54 to 5.05; p&lt;0.00001). The present updated meta-analysis documents a significant association between residual platelet reactivity under clopidogrel treatment and recurrent cardiovascular events, so suggesting the relevance of ongoing interventional studies aimed at tailoring the antithrombotic therapy in CAD patients.",M2
20134281,"Ankle brachial index as a prognostic tool for women with coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) is the leading cause of death among women both nationally and internationally. Despite increased knowledge regarding CAD in women, early diagnosis remains a difficult clinical task. A correlation between peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and CAD has been noted in previous research; however, these studies were either retrospective or did not focus on women. This research investigates the correlation of ankle brachial index (ABI), measurements used to diagnose PAD, and presence of CAD in women, in an effort to determine the predictive value of ABI specifically in women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective correlation design was used to study women (n = 30) who were undergoing a diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Ankle brachial index readings were obtained prior to the catheterization procedure. Catheterization findings were grouped according to absence of CAD or presence of 1-vessel or multivessel CAD and coupled with each woman's ABI and recorded cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Peripheral arterial disease (based on ABI of &lt;0.90 mm Hg) was found in 13.3% of the women. A significant correlation was found between ABI of less than 0.90 mm Hg and increasing age (t = -2.30, P =.029). Coronary artery disease was found in 82.1% of the women; more than half (57.1%) had multivessel disease. Absence of CAD was noted in 17.9%. Women with CAD were older than women without CAD (F = 3.86, P =.035). No significant differences were found between presence or absence of PAD based on ABI and diagnosis of no coronary disease or 1-vessel or multivessel coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show the expected correlation between ABI of less than 0.90 mm Hg and CAD, but did show a significant correlation of age with presence of both PAD and CAD. Further research that focuses specifically on women is needed and should include a larger sample, additional unique cardiovascular risk factors, and innovative diagnostic tests to determine presence of CAD in women early in the disease process.",M2
20134091,"Plasma viscosity and mean platelet volume in patients undergoing coronary angiography.BACKGROUND: Markers of platelet activation and haemorrheological indices have been demonstrated to play a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed at investigate the association between plasma viscosity and platelet indices in patients undergoing coronary angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and eighty four consecutive patients scheduled to undergo coronary angiography were included in the study. Prior to coronary angiography, blood samples were withdrawn to determine routine biochemical markers, blood cell analyses and viscosity measurements. According to the results of coronary angiography, patients were classified either in a subgroup with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>; 1 or more stenoses &gt;50%) or normal coronary arteries (NCA; no stenoses or &lt;50%). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant correlation between plasma viscosity and mean platelet volume levels in all patients undergoing coronary angiography (r=0.199, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, when correlation analysis was performed within each group, plasma viscosity significantly correlated with MPV both in patients with CAD (r=0.18, p=0.004) and in patients with NCAs (r=0.272, p=0.002). Linear regression analysis revealed that plasma viscosity was positively associated with MPV while platelet number was inversely but significantly associated with MPV. CONCLUSION: We have shown for the first time that MPV correlates with plasma viscosity in patients undergoing coronary angiography, suggesting a relation with plasma proteins and activation of circulating platelets or peripheral consumption of platelets. To evaluate this relation further controlled studies also in patients with acute coronary syndromes are warranted.",M2
20131186,"Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire as an additional tool in clinical assessment of patients with coronary artery disease treated with angioplasty.BACKGROUND: The association between frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity and the risk of cardiovascular disease has been investigated in several studies. Out of many methods used for assessment of physical activity, a questionnaire seems to be a simple and affordable method of assessing the risk of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). However, the number of clinical studies investigating the usefulness of physical activity questionnaires is limited. AIM: To analyse the usefulness of Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) in assessment of the correlation between the magnitude of physical activity-related energy expenditure and physical capacity assessed with treadmill exercise test (ET), risk of early onset of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and selected haemodynamic parameters in patients with CAD. METHODS: The study group consisted of 211 patients aged 34-79 years (mean 59) with CAD, with or without previous myocardial infarction (MI). All patients were surveyed using PPAQ at the time of PCI and then 6 months later together with ET and echocardiography. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the value of activity-related weekly energy expenditure assessed with the PPAQ and selected parameters of ET (duration: r = 0.2966, p &lt; 0.0001; METs: r = 0.2221, p &lt; 0.001; VO(2)max: r = 0.3075, p &lt; 0.0001; resting HR: r = 0.1615, p &lt; 0.01 and maximal HR: r = -0.1475, p &lt; 0.01) and echocardiography (LVESD r = 0.2346, p &lt; 0.0001). After the PCI procedure, there was a considerable increase in physical capacity (ET duration: 5.82 vs. 7.48 min, p &lt; 0.0001; MET: 7.57 vs. 9.18, p &lt; 0.0001; VO(2)max: 29.23 vs. 34.79 ml, p &lt; 0.0001; HRmax: 123 vs. 132 beats/min, p &lt; 0.0001) and LV function (EF% 51.64 vs. 52.45%, p &lt; 0.01). There was an insignificant change in total physical activity-related energy expenditure of low intensity (&lt; 4 MET), not exceeding 2000 kcal/week (from 3120.13 to 3139.18 kcal/week, p &gt; 0.05). Thirty-seven patients with MACE had a trend towards a lower value of average weekly energy expenditure than the remaining 174 patients (2690.71 vs. 3206.06 kcal/week, NS). CONCLUSIONS: High values of correlation coefficients between the questionnaire results and some variables of ET and echocardiography examination make the PPAQ a useful tool in clinical studies.",M2
20129357,"An innovative noninvasive respiratory stress test indicates significant coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Respiratory maneuvers can uncover manifestations of myocardial ischemia. Some pulse wave characteristics are strongly associated with significant coronary artery disease (S-<e>CAD</e>). An innovative test using the respiratory stress response (RSR) has been developed for the detection of S-CAD. It is based on spectral analysis of finger pulse wave oscillations measured by photoplethysmography during deep, paced breathing at a rate of six breaths per minute (0.1 Hz) over 70 s. METHODS: RSR was assessed, prior to the procedure, in 150 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography. It was calculated by analyzing the relative spectral power of the respiratory peak area at 0.1 Hz, using proprietary software. The coronary angiograms were analyzed by quantitative coronary angiography by 1 cardiologist who was blinded to the RSR results. S-CAD was defined as luminal stenosis &gt;70% of &gt; or = 1 coronary artery with a diameter &gt; or = 2 mm, or left main stenosis &gt;50%. A valid RSR was obtained in 150 of 153 patients (98%) with a mean age of 58.7 + or - 10.6 years (67% males). RESULTS: S-CAD was found in 36 patients (24%). S-CAD patients had significantly lower RSR compared to patients without S-CAD (6.7% + or - 5.1 vs. 17.4% + or - 10.6; P&lt;.001, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for known CAD risk factors, showed that RSR is a strong independent indicator of S-CAD (odds ratio 41.2, 95% CI 12.2-139.3; P&lt;.001). CONCLUSION: The innovative RSR test is a simple, noninvasive bedside or office-based tool for the detection of S-CAD.",M2
20128148,"Age-related change of serum angiogenic factor levels in patients with coronary artery disease.OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2 regulate angiogenesis and might be important in myocardial collateral development. Elevated levels of angiogenic growth factors in patients with coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) have been reported. However, the age-related change of angiogenic growth factors in patients with CAD remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum VEGF, Ang-1 and -2 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Serum VEGF, Ang-1 and -2 levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher than those in healthy control subjects. In patients aged &lt;61 years and 61 to 70 years, serum Ang-1 and -2 levels were significantly higher than in patients aged &gt;70 years, serum Ang-2 levels in patients aged &lt;61 years were significantly higher than in patients aged from 61 to 70 years. Serum VEGF levels were not significantly different in the three age groups. Serum VEGF, Ang-1 and -2 levels were not significantly different across the age groups in healthy subjects. Regression analysis showed that there was a negative correlation between age and Ang-1 and -2 in patients with CAD. CONCLUSION: Serum Ang-1 and -2 levels, but notVEGF levels in patients with CAD, are decreased along with advancing age.",M2
20119930,"Ventricular function and all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease patients with angiographic coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Traditional and nontraditional risk factors, hypertension, fluid overloading and anemia can lead to myocardial ischemia, chamber hypertrophy and dilatation, and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in CKD patients. The angiographic feature, ventriculographic LVEF and its relationship to all-cause mortality are unclear in patients with different stages of CKD who are not yet on dialysis. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 980 CKD patients with suspected myocardial ischemia who underwent coronary angiography from 1995 to 2004. Demographic, clinical data and ventriculographic LVEF were assessed. Risk estimations for mortality were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: Of the CKD patients, 445 (45.4%) had angiographic CAD. Their hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI) and LVEF values decreased with decrease in eGFR. Using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, low LVEF was independently associated with CKD after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, BMI, hemoglobin and the presence of CAD. Significant independent prognostic factors for mortality included diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.946; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.185-7.322), BMI (HR=0.864; 95% CI, 0.757-0.985), hemoglobin (HR=0.742; 95% CI, 0.594-0.928) and LVEF (HR=0.944; 95% CI, 0.918-0.970). Low LVEF was the only independent significant prognostic factor in CKD patients with angiographic CAD (HR=0.957; 95% CI, 0.918-0.996). CONCLUSION: LVEF reduction was independently associated with CKD. Low LVEF was an independent predictor of mortality in CKD patients regardless of the presence of angiographic CAD.",M2
20117059,"Focal mechanism of ventricular tachycardia in coronary artery disease.BACKGROUND: Re-entry is the most common mechanism of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction (MI). OBJECTIVE: This study sought to report the electrophysiological properties of a series of patients with prior MI who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for VT originating instead from a focal source. METHODS: The electrophysiological properties of 46 patients with prior MI (male 89%, age 64.8 +/- 10.2 years) who underwent RFA for sustained VT were studied. A total of 101 VTs were induced (92 [91%] macro-re-entrant VT and 9 [9%] focal VT). RESULTS: One patient had adenosine-sensitive idiopathic focal VT. The focal VT group had a significantly shorter pre-systolic interval (electrogram to QRS) during VT compared with the macro-re-entrant VT group (36 +/- 17 ms vs. 117 +/- 67 ms, P = .001). The successful ablation sites in the focal VT group also had a significantly lower ratio (in percentage) of electrogram-QRS interval to diastolic interval (VT cycle length - QRS duration) during VT (14 +/- 8%) as compared with macro-re-entrant VTs (48 +/- 30%, P &lt;.001). Focal VTs demonstrated an apparent point source of endocardial activation and could not be entrained, whereas 77% of macro-re-entrant VTs were entrained. Successful ablation sites for focal VT (success rate 100%) were predominantly in the basal half of the left ventricle (75%), whereas only 60% of macro-re-entrant VTs (success rate 90.7%) were basal (P = .01). However, the procedure time, VT cycle length, number of RFA applications required for success, and acute success results were not significantly different in these 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A focal mechanism is present in up to 9% of VTs in patients with <e>CAD</e> and prior MI that are induced during electrophysiology study for RF ablation. Mechanistic distinction from more typical macro-re-entrant VT in this population is important because ablation site characteristics are very different.",M2
20116656,"Optimal cutoff value of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for predicting coronary artery disease in Taiwanese population.The aim of this study was to determine if an optimal cutoff value for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) can be obtained for predicting the risk of coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) in Taiwanese population. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. Patients identified by cardiac catheterization as having at least 70% stenosis of one major coronary artery and without diabetes were assigned to the case group (n = 184). The control group (n = 516) was composed of healthy individuals with normal blood biochemical values. The multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate linear association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C, or LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and CAD while adjusting for confounders. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were constructed. Individuals with an HDL-C value less than or equal to 60 mg/dL had the significantly highest odds ratio (7.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.70-22.07) after adjusting for LDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and other potential confounders. The areas under the curves were 0.85 and 0.61 for HDL-C and LDL-C, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of HDL-C for predicting the presence of CAD was 46 mg/dL. Sensitivity and specificity using this cutoff value were 71.74% and 81.40%, respectively. Our findings suggest that subjects with lower levels of HDL-C have a much higher risk of CAD than those with higher levels of LDL-C. The optimal cutoff value for HDL-C in predicting the risk of CAD is considered as 46 mg/dL in the Taiwanese population.",M2
20104451,"Pathophysiology, risk stratification, and management of sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease.Management of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is undergoing radical change in direction. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that besides depressed left ventricular systolic function and the conventional risk stratification tools, new markers for plaque vulnerability, enhanced thrombogenesis, specific genetic alterations of the autonomic nervous system, cardiac sarcolemmal and contractile proteins, and familial clustering may better segregate patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) who are at high risk of SCD from those who may suffer from nonfatal ischemic events. Better understanding of pathophysiologic processes such as post-myocardial infarction remodeling, the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure, and the increased cardiovascular risk of CAD in the presence of diabetes or even a pre-diabetic state will help to improve both risk stratification and management. The rapidly developing fields of microchips technology, and proteomics may allow rapid and cost-effective mass screening of multiple risk factors for SCD. The ultimate goal is not only to change the current direction of management strategy of SCD away from increased ICD utilization, but to identify novel methods for risk stratification, risk modification, and prevention of SCD that could be applied to the general public at large.",M2
20124233,"Meta-analysis: noninvasive coronary angiography using computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging.BACKGROUND: Two imaging techniques, multislice computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have evolved for noninvasive coronary angiography. PURPOSE: To compare CT and MRI for ruling out clinically significant coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>) in adults with suspected or known CAD. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science searches from inception through 2 June 2009 and bibliographies of reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective English- or German-language studies that compared CT or MRI with conventional coronary angiography in all patients and included sufficient data for compilation of 2 x 2 tables. DATA EXTRACTION: 2 investigators independently extracted patient and study characteristics; differences were resolved by consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: 89 and 20 studies (comprising 7516 and 989 patients) assessed CT and MRI, respectively. Bivariate analysis of data yielded a mean sensitivity and specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 96.2% to 98.0%) and 87.4% (CI, 84.5% to 89.8%) for CT and 87.1% (CI, 83.0% to 90.3%) and 70.3% (CI, 58.8% to 79.7%) for MRI. In studies that included only patients with suspected CAD, sensitivity and specificity of CT were 97.6% (CI, 96.1% to 98.5%) and 89.2% (CI, 86.0% to 91.8%). Covariate analysis yielded a significantly higher sensitivity for CT scanners with more than 16 rows (98.1% [CI, 97.0% to 99.0%]; P &lt; 0.050) than for older-generation scanners (95.6% [CI, 94.0% to 97.0%]). Heart rates less than 60 beats/min during CT yielded significantly better values for sensitivity than did higher heart rates (P &lt; 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Few studies investigated coronary angiography with MRI. Only 5 studies were direct head-to-head comparisons of CT and MRI. Covariate analyses explained only part of the observed heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: For ruling out CAD, CT is more accurate than MRI. Scanners with more than 16 rows improve sensitivity, as do slowed heart rates. Primary Funding Source: None.",M2
20124046,"Improved quantification and normal limits for myocardial perfusion stress-rest change.We aimed to improve the quantification of myocardial perfusion stress-rest changes in myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) studies for the optimal automatic detection of ischemia and coronary artery disease (<e>CAD</e>). METHODS: Rest-stress (99m)Tc MPS studies (997 cases; 651 consecutive cases with correlating angiography and 346 cases with less than 5% likelihood (low likelihood [LLK]) of CAD) were analyzed. Normal limits for stress-rest changes were derived from additional LLK patients (40 women, 40 men). We computed the global stress-rest change (C-SR) by integrating direct stress-rest changes for each polar map pixel. Additionally, stress-rest change and total perfusion deficit (TPD) at stress were combined in 1 variable (C-TPD) for the optimal detection of CAD. RESULTS: The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) for C-SR (0.92) was larger than that for stress TPD-rest TPD (0.88) for the identification of stenosis of 70% or more (P &lt; 0.0001). AUC (0.94) and sensitivity (90%) for C-TPD were higher than those for stress TPD (0.91 and 83%, respectively) (P &lt; 0.0001), whereas specificity remained the same (81%). CONCLUSION: C-SR and C-TPD provide higher diagnostic performance than difference between stress and rest TPD or stress hypoperfusion analysis.",M2
