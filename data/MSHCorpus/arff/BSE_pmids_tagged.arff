20350325,"A 2cM genome-wide scan of European Holstein cattle affected by classical <e>BSE</e>.BACKGROUND: Classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is an acquired prion disease that is invariably fatal in cattle and has been implicated as a significant human health risk. Polymorphisms that alter the prion protein of sheep or humans have been associated with variations in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy susceptibility or resistance. In contrast, there is no strong evidence that non-synonymous mutations in the bovine prion gene (PRNP) are associated with classical BSE disease susceptibility. However, two bovine PRNP insertion/deletion polymorphisms, one within the promoter region and the other in intron 1, have been associated with susceptibility to classical BSE. These associations do not explain the full extent of BSE susceptibility, and loci outside of PRNP appear to be associated with disease incidence in some cattle populations. To test for associations with BSE susceptibility, we conducted a genome wide scan using a panel of 3,072 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 814 animals representing cases and control Holstein cattle from the United Kingdom BSE epidemic. RESULTS: Two sets of BSE affected Holstein cattle were analyzed in this study, one set with known family relationships and the second set of paired cases with controls. The family set comprises half-sibling progeny from six sires. The progeny from four of these sires had previously been scanned with microsatellite markers. The results obtained from the current analysis of the family set yielded both some supporting and new results compared with those obtained in the earlier study. The results revealed 27 SNPs representing 18 chromosomes associated with incidence of BSE disease. These results confirm a region previously reported on chromosome 20, and identify additional regions on chromosomes 2, 14, 16, 21 and 28. This study did not identify a significant association near the PRNP in the family sample set. The only association found in the PRNP region was in the case-control sample set and this was not significant after multiple test correction. The genome scan of the case-control animals did not identify any associations that passed a stringent genome-wide significance threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Several regions of the genome are statistically associated with the incidence of classical BSE in European Holstein cattle. Further investigation of loci on chromosomes 2, 14, 16, 20, 21 and 28 will be required to uncover any biological significance underlying these marker associations.",M1
20214905,"A single step multiplex immunofluorometric assay for differential diagnosis of <e>BSE</e> and scrapie.Although there is no evidence that the European sheep population has been infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), distinguishing this from scrapie is paramount, given the association between BSE exposure and the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The capability to differentially diagnose TSEs in sheep is thus essential in order to safeguard the food chain and human health. Biochemical methods for differentiating BSE and scrapie are largely reliant on assessment by Western blot (WB) analysis of the abnormal disease associated prion protein PrP(D) following partial proteolytic digestion. WB banding patterns obtained using a panel of antibodies enable different strain specific conformations of PrP(D) to be distinguished. This approach provides a robust confirmatory test but one which is not appropriate for high throughput screening. A simple, one step, bead array flow cytometry based multiplex immunofluorometric assay has been developed which is suitable for simultaneous screening and confirmation. Using a combination of antibodies directed towards three PrP epitopes enabled differential diagnosis of scrapie and BSE. Proof of principle studies indicated a high predictive value (100%) when applied to brain samples from control animals, BSE infected cattle and sheep naturally infected with scrapie or experimentally infected with BSE.",M1
20163615,"Gene and haplotype polymorphisms of the Prion gene (PRNP) in Japanese Brown, Japanese native and Holstein cattle.Polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PRNP) are known to be associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in human, sheep and goats. There is tentative association between PRNP promoter polymorphism and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) susceptibility in cattle. In this study, we genotyped for six bovine PRNP polymorphic sites including a 23-bp indel in the promoter, a 12-bp indel in the intron 1, two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), octapeptide repeats in the coding region and a 14-bp indel in the 3'-untranslated region in 178 animals representing Japanese Brown, Kuchinoshima feral, Mishima, Japanese Shorthorn and Holstein. In 64 Japanese Brown cattle, three indel sites were polymorphic. All of the six sites were monomorphic in Kuchinoshima. The 23-bp and 12-bp indel sites were polymorphic in Mishima cattle. The 23-bp and 14-bp indel sites were polymorphic in Japanese Shorthorn cattle. Both SNP sites were monomorphic in all cattle examined in this study. At the 23-bp indel site, the genotype frequencies of Japanese Brown and Holstein breeds were similar to that of BSE affected cattle. We estimated 12 different haplotypes from these genotypic data. A '23-12-K6S14+' haplotype was the major haplotype in all populations, whose frequencies ranged from 0.50 to 1.00.",M1
20153480,"Characterization of strains of ovine transmissible spongiform encephalopathy with a short PrPd profiling method.Scrapie is the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that naturally affects sheep and goats; these species are also susceptible to experimental infection with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) agent. Discrimination between different strains of sheep scrapie and ovine BSE has been achieved by descriptive and quantitative profiling of deposits of the disease-associated prion protein (PrPd) in different areas of the brain, but this process is time-consuming and difficult to standardize between laboratories. The present paper describes an alternative PrPd profiling method that is less demanding and addresses these difficulties. It is based on the scoring of similar 14 PrPd types in 11 precisely defined areas of the telencephalon. When applied to 48 archived cases of experimental sheep BSE, SSBP/1, CH1641 and natural scrapie, it gave comparable results to the original profiling method, previously conducted on the same brains, and allowed differentiation between the different infectious sources. This new 'short PrPd profiling' method has the advantages of being less time-consuming and easier to standardize, so that it can be readily adopted by different laboratories to provide comparable results.",M1
19954458,"Intraspecies transmission of L-type-like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy detected in Japan.It has been assumed that the agent causing <e>BSE</e> in cattle is a uniform strain (classical BSE); however, different neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of BSE (atypical BSE) have been recently reported. We demonstrated the successful transmission of L-type-like atypical BSE detected in Japan (BSE/JP24 isolate) to cattle. Based on the incubation period, neuropathological hallmarks, and molecular properties of the abnormal host prion protein, the characteristics of BSE/JP24 prion were apparently distinguishable from the classical BSE prion and closely resemble those of bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy prion detected in Italy.",M1
19949303,"In vitro amplification of prions from milk in the detection of subclinical infections.Prions can be amplified by serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) from the milk of a high proportion of apparently healthy, scrapie exposed sheep with PRNP genotypes not previously associated with high disease penetrance. These data strongly suggest the widespread presence of subclinical scrapie infections within scrapie-exposed flocks containing sheep with a range of susceptible PRNP genotypes. These data also lead to the hypothesis that similar subclinical disease states may be common for other animal and human prion diseases. Furthermore, the application of sPMCA to milk provides a method to detect such subclinical disease. Here, we describe the high level amplification of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) prions from both ovine and bovine origin, a methodology that will facilitate the detection of any prions secreted within bovine and ovine milk during subclinical and clinical BSE disease.",M1

19901284,"Evaluation of three rapid diagnostic tests used in bovine spongiform encephalopathy monitoring in Italy.In 2001, a compulsory active surveillance system was started in the European Union to assess the prevalence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in the cattle population. The aim of the current study was to report on the field performances of 3 rapid tests: a Western blot (WB), a chemiluminescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and an immunochromatographic assay, routinely used at 3 laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Lombardia and Emilia Romagna, over 8 years of BSE monitoring activity. A total of 2,802,866 samples from slaughtered animals and 202,453 samples from fallen stock were tested by 1 of 3 tests. Positive results of the rapid tests were confirmed by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and confirmatory WB. The field performances (i.e., initial reactive and false-positive rates) and practical aspects regarding resources and applicability of the tests to high-throughput routine testing laboratories were evaluated. The 3 tests proved to be reliable tools when applied to slaughtered samples, showing no or very low false-positive rates (&lt;1 per 100,000 negative samples tested) and low retesting frequencies (0.02-0.26%). When samples from fallen stock were analyzed, performances of the immunochromatographic assay, and especially the chemiluminescence ELISA, were negatively affected, resulting in higher false-positive and retesting rates. On the other hand, both tests are less expensive, much easier to use, provide more rapid results, and adapt well to application in routine laboratories as compared with WB. In the authors' experience, the immunochromatographic assay was a good compromise between performance and convenience.",M1
19875887,"Prion protein gene polymorphism in healthy and <e>BSE</e>-affected Slovak cattle.Variation of the PrP gene was examined in healthy and BSE-affected Slovak cattle. According to previous studies, the 23-bp indel polymorphism is supposed to be associated with higher susceptibility to BSE. We investigated 301 samples from healthy cattle of various Slovak breeds and 24 samples obtained from tissues of BSE-affected cattle in Slovakia. We examined the PrP gene for the 23-bp indel polymorphism in the putative promoter region, 12-bp indel polymorphism in the first intron of the PrP gene, variations in number of octapeptide repeat units, and presence of the silent AAC&gt;AAT transition in codon 192 within the protein-coding region of the PrP gene. Altogether we found 23 different genotypes in the group of healthy cattle and only 6 genotypes in the group of BSE-affected cattle. Comparison of homozygotes for the 23-bp insertion and heterozygotes showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in genotype distribution between the examined groups. Thereby the homozygous insertion genotype at the 23-bp indel polymorphism site in the promoter region of the prion protein gene seems to have a protective effect against BSE.",M1
19843289,"Increase in CD230 (cellular prion protein) fluorescence on blood lymphocytes in bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected nonhuman primates.BACKGROUND: The cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) plays a central role in prion diseases such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This disease can be transmitted by blood transfusion. However, the exact kinetics of blood infectivity and the blood fraction carrying infectivity have not yet been identified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Simian PrP(c) epitopes were mapped by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). A whole blood/no wash protocol was established, validated, and applied to investigate peripheral blood cell-associated PrP(c) expression profiles in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>)-infected cynomolgus monkeys and age-/sex-matched controls. In addition, physiologic expression patterns on blood cells and in lymphoid tissues were determined. RESULTS: In BSE-infected macaques, blood lymphocyte-associated PrP(c) fluorescence gradually increased years before the onset of clinical signs (p(F test) &lt; 0.0001). The increase in fluorescence intensity was detectable with MoAb 12F10, whereas we failed to detect an increase with 3F4. In parallel, plasma concentrations of soluble CD230 also increased. Centrifugation of lymphocytes almost completely eliminated differences between infected and noninfected animals, most likely caused by a partial loss in cell-associated CD230 into the plasma supernatant. CONCLUSION: Blood lymphocytes from asymptomatically infected as well as diseased macaques were characterized by increased CD230 fluorescence, and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C-resistant PrP molecules contributed at least partially to this increase. Conformational changes within PrP(c) molecules may be the underlying mechanism for the increased PrP(c) fluorescence. This cell-associated phenomenon contributed at least partially to an increase in soluble plasma-derived PrP(c) levels. It is not yet known whether these changes reflect infectivity.",M1
19836847,"Estimating the impact on the food chain of changing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) control measures: the BSE control model.The decline in the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) demands a review of control strategies to ensure that they remain proportionate. Amongst controls that are subject to review are those intended to minimise the risk of BSE exposure of consumers through food. Such risk mitigation steps are costly, and the relative impact of each in terms of human exposure to BSE infectivity is not known. This risk assessment, termed the BSE Control Model, aims to estimate by use of stochastic simulation the impact of testing of cattle at slaughter and the removal of Specified Risk Materials (SRM) on potential BSE infectivity consumed. This paper describes the use of the model to investigate the effect of different risk management methods that have been or could be implemented between 2005 and 2010. Our results suggest that the amount of infectivity consumed in 2005 with the Over Thirty Month (OTM) rule in place was a mean of 0.03 bovine oral ID(50) (BO ID(50)). This is an extremely low amount, particularly considering that it would be spread over, on average, 236 infected carcases that would be further sub-divided into portions for human consumption. The highest contributor to the total amount of infectivity consumed per year is spinal contamination at carcase splitting (35%). In 2006 the OTM scheme was discontinued and head meat was again permitted into the food chain. These changes resulted in an increase in the amount of infectivity consumed, rising to an estimated 28 BO ID(50) in 2006, and 19 BO ID(50) in 2007. In 2008 the age at removal of vertebral column was raised from 24 to 30 months, and an estimated 24 BO ID(50) of infectivity was consumed. At the beginning of 2009 the age at testing of cattle was raised to 48 months for healthy slaughter, emergency slaughter and fallen stock. Under these conditions, an estimated mean of 24 BO ID(50) will be consumed in 2009, decreasing to 20 BO ID(50) in 2010. Even though presented in terms of bovine rather than human oral ID(50), such estimates represent an extremely low exposure of the British population. Considerable uncertainty would surround any attempt to try to convert such exposure into estimates of new cases of vCJD, but the most recent estimates of the size of the species barrier between cattle and humans (4000, EFSA, 2006) suggest that there would be few, if any, new cases of vCJD arising from such exposure levels.",M1
19836525,"Prion protein detection in serum using micromechanical resonator arrays.Prion proteins that have transformed from their normal cellular counterparts (PrP(c)) into infectious form (PrP(res)) are responsible for causing progressive neurodegenerative diseases in numerous species, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in cattle (also known as mad cow disease), scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. Due to a possible link between BSE and CJD it is highly desirable to develop non-invasive and ante mortem tests for the detection of prion proteins in bovine samples. Such ante mortem tests of all cows prior to slaughter will help to prevent the introduction of PrP(res) into the human food supply. Furthermore, detection of PrP(res) in donated blood will also help to prevent the transmission of CJD among humans through blood transfusion. In this study, we have continued development of a micromechanical resonator array that is capable of detecting PrP(c) in bovine blood serum. The sensitivity of the resonators for the detection of PrP(c) is further enhanced by the use of secondary mass labels. A pair of antibodies is used in a sandwich immunoassay format to immobilize PrP(c) on the surface of resonators and attach nanoparticles as secondary mass labels to PrP(c). Secondary mass labeling is optimized in terms of incubation time to maximize the frequency shifts that correspond to the presence of PrP(c) on the surface of resonators. Our results show that a minimum of 200 pg mL(-1) of PrP(c) in blood serum can be detected using micromechanical resonator arrays.",M1
19828761,"Strain-specific proteolytic processing of the prion protein in prion diseases of ruminants transmitted in ovine transgenic mice.The cerebral prion protein (PrP) isolated in the absence of proteinase K digestion, from ruminants prion sources transmitted to ovine transgenic mice, was studied by Western blot analysis. A C2 PrP fragment, showing strain-specific cleavages, similar to those observed after proteinase K or thermolysin digestion, accumulated in the brain. 'CH1641-like' scrapie was characterized by the unique accumulation of a more C-terminally cleaved PrP fragment (CTF14). A similar, protease-resistant, PrP product was observed after proteinase K or thermolysin digestion. Whereas classical <e>BSE</e> appeared highly resistant to thermolysin digestion, CH1641 and 'CH1641-like' natural isolates did not show any remarkable feature regarding resistance to thermolysin. Thus, the molecular strain-specific features in the brain of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy infected mice essentially reflect the PrP proteolytic processing occurring in vivo.",M1
19765298,"Transmissibility studies of vacuolar changes in the rostral colliculus of pigs.BACKGROUND: Histopathological examinations of brains from healthy pigs have revealed localised vacuolar changes, predominantly in the rostral colliculus, that are similar to the neuropil vacuolation featured in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and have been described in pigs challenged parenterally with the agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>). Feedstuff containing BSE-contaminated meat and bone meal (MBM) may have been fed to pigs prior to the ban of mammalian MBM in feed of farmed livestock in the United Kingdom in 1996, but there is no evidence of the natural occurrence of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in the domestic pig. Furthermore, experimental transmission of BSE to pigs by the oral route has been unsuccessful. A study was conducted to investigate whether the localised vacuolar changes in the porcine brain were associated with a transmissible aetiology and therefore biologically significant. Two groups of ten pigs were inoculated parenterally with vacuolated rostral colliculus from healthy pigs either born before 1996 or born after 1996. Controls included ten pigs similarly inoculated with rostral colliculus from New Zealand-derived pigs and nine pigs inoculated with a bovine BSE brain homogenate. RESULTS: None of the pigs inoculated with rostral colliculus developed a TSE-like neurological disease up to five years post inoculation when the study was terminated, and disease-associated prion protein, PrPd, was not detected in the brains of these pigs. By contrast, eight of nine BSE-inoculated pigs developed neurological signs, two of which had detectable PrPd by postmortem tests. No significant histopathological changes were detected to account for the clinical signs in the PrPd-negative, BSE-inoculated pigs. CONCLUSION: The findings in this study suggest that vacuolation in the porcine rostral colliculus is not caused by a transmissible agent and is probably a clinically insignificant change. The presence of neurological signs in pigs inoculated with BSE without detectable PrPd raises the possibility that the BSE agent may produce a prion disease in pigs that remains undetected by the current postmortem tests.",M1
19761625,"Time trends in exposure of cattle to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and cohort effect in France and Italy: value of the classical Age-Period-Cohort approach.BACKGROUND: The Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis is routinely used for time trend analysis of cancer incidence or mortality rates, but in veterinary epidemiology, there are still only a few examples of this application. APC models were recently used to model the French epidemic assuming that the time trend for <e>BSE</e> was mainly due to a cohort effect in relation to the control measures that may have modified the BSE exposure of cohorts over time. We used a categorical APC analysis which did not require any functional form for the effect of the variables, and examined second differences to estimate the variation of the BSE trend. We also reanalysed the French epidemic and performed a simultaneous analysis of Italian data using more appropriate birth cohort categories for comparison. RESULTS: We used data from the exhaustive surveillance carried out in France and Italy between 2001 and 2007, and comparatively described the trend of the epidemic in both countries. At the end, the shape and irregularities of the trends were discussed in light of the main control measures adopted to control the disease. In Italy a decrease in the epidemic became apparent from 1996, following the application of rendering standards for the processing of specific risk material (SRM). For the French epidemic, the pattern of second differences in the birth cohorts confirmed the beginning of the decrease from 1995, just after the implementation of the meat and bone meal (MBM) ban for all ruminants (1994). CONCLUSION: The APC analysis proved to be highly suitable for the study of the trend in BSE epidemics and was helpful in understanding the effects of management and control of the disease. Additionally, such an approach may help in the implementation of changes in BSE regulations.",M1
19753609,"High sensitivity detection of the glial fibrillary acidic protein as indicator for TSE risk material in meat products using an immuno-PCR.The emergence of prion diseases in cattle during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) epidemic and the transmission to humans causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by consume of BSE-contaminated meat has focused attention on the use of tissues from the central nervous system (CNS) in food. To avoid food contamination, it is regulated by law that specified risk material has to be removed from food chains. Detection of well-expressed CNS indicator proteins such as the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) assumes an important role in detection of food contamination; however, the sensitivity of detection performed on basis of ELISAs is limited. Consequently, there is an urgent need for high-sensitivity detection methods. We describe the development of an immuno-PCR assay with enhancement of the immunoreaction by amplification of a DNA fragment linked to the antigen-antibody complex. This immuno-PCR assay shows enhanced sensitivity in GFAP detection of at least two orders of magnitude compared to the ELISA technique carried out under identical conditions. The immuno-PCR proves to be a suitable tool for the high-sensitivity detection of marker proteins in food imported by food chain processes. It is applicable for use by food and veterinary facilities, and institutes involved in food monitoring.",M1
19751582,"Transgenic mice expressing porcine prion protein resistant to classical scrapie but susceptible to sheep bovine spongiform encephalopathy and atypical scrapie.How susceptible pigs are to infection with sheep prions is unknown. We show, through transmission experiments in transgenic mice expressing porcine prion protein (PrP), that the susceptibility of this mouse model to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) can be enhanced after its passage in ARQ sheep, indicating that the pathogenicity of the BSE agent is modified after passage in sheep. Transgenic mice expressing porcine PrP were, nevertheless, completely resistant to infection with a broad panel of classical scrapie isolates from different sheep PrP genotypes and with different biochemical characteristics. The atypical (Nor98 like) isolate (SC-PS152) was the only scrapie isolate capable of transmission in these mice, although with a marked transmission barrier. Unexpectedly, the atypical scrapie agent appeared to undergo a strain phenotype shift upon transmission to porcine-PrP transgenic mice and acquired new strain properties, suggesting that atypical scrapie agent may exhibit different phenotypes depending on the host cellular PrP or other genetic factors.",M1
19748690,"Age-dependent windows for cohort culling in <e>BSE</e> herds.With the discovery of a BSE case in a herd, practice in Denmark prior to 2005 has been to cull any herd in its entirety, to avoid the risk of further cases. However, a growing dissatisfaction with this practice has led to a desire to be able to cull a minor fraction of a BSE herd only, while still removing the majority of the risk. One proposed method has been cohort culling. All animals in a certain age window around the age of the infected animal are culled, assuming that the BSE case and all other potential cases were infected at roughly the same time. This paper presents a method to characterize the animals in a BSE infected herd most at risk for developing BSE from the exposure that resulted in the index case. The results suggest that a +/-one-and-a-half year cohort cull would work well in Denmark for index BSE cases with an age of 6 years or less, but for older BSE cases the method is completely inadequate, making age-dependent windows a necessity. Formulas for calculating age-dependent windows are provided, and age-dependent windows for a herd size corresponding to a herd size equal to the 85% percentile of the Danish herds are provided in graphical form. A case study with a 9-year-old index case is presented.",M1
19744145,"Molecular analysis of carbohydrate N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O sulfotransferase 8 (CHST8) as a candidate gene for bovine spongiform encephalopathy susceptibility.Endogenous prion proteins (PrP) play the central role in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The carbohydrate N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O sulfotransferase 8 (CHST8) promotes the conversion of the cellular PrP(C) into the pathogenic PrP(d). Six sequence variants within the CHST8 gene were identified by comparative sequencing and genotyped for a sample of 623 animals comprising bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>)-affected and healthy control cows representing German Fleckvieh (German Simmental), German Holstein (Holstein-Friesian) and Brown Swiss. Significant differences in the allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies between BSE-affected and healthy cows indicate an association of sequence variant g.37254017G&gt;T with the development of the disease in Brown Swiss cattle.",M1
19727594,"Establishment of bovine prion peptide-based monoclonal antibodies for identifying bovine prion.To obtain high titer monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) which can react with mammalian prion protein (PrP), Balb/C mice were immunized with bovine (Bo) PrP peptide (BoPrP 209-228 aa) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies against the peptide were established by cell fusion and cloning. The obtained McAbs were applied to detect recombinant human, bovine and hamster PrP, cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) in normal bovine brain and pathogenic scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)) accumulated in the medulla oblongata of bovine spongiform encephalopathy(<e>BSE</e>)specimen with Western blot and immunohistochemical detection, respectively. The current procedure might offer a simple, feasible method to raise high titer antibodies for studying biological features of PrP in mammals, as well as detection of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and diagnosis of BSE, in particular.",M1
19722131,"[Protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) in the blood of offspring of cows that developed <e>BSE</e>]The goal of the present study was to investigate whether protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) occurs in plasma samples of offspring of cows that developed bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; group A) and to compare the prevalence with that of a healthy control group in 2006 (Group B). Group A consisted of 181 offspring of cows that developed BSE and group B consisted of 240 healthy animals from a region in Switzerland where no cases of BSE occurred from 2001 to the end of 2006. All plasma samples were evaluated using Alicon PrioTrap, an antemortem test for PrPres. The time between birth of the offspring and onset of BSE in the dam was calculated to determine its relationship with the presence of PrPres in the plasma of the offspring. From 181 offspring, 29 (16.1%) had PrPres-positive plasma samples. Offspring that were born within one year of the onset of BSE in the dam had a significantly higher prevalence of PrPres-positive plasma samples than those born more than one year before the onset of BSE in the dam. Ten (4.2%) of 240 control cattle had PrPres-positive plasma samples. Thus, PrPres can be detected in bovine blood and occurs more frequently in the offspring of cows that develop BSE than in cattle of a healthy control population.",M1
19697247,"The psychosocial and socioeconomic consequences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>): a community impact study.The detection of the first indigenous case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Canada on May 20, 2003, had significant consequences for the livestock industry. As a result, borders were closed by several trade partners, particularly the United States. The outbreak led to direct and indirect economic impacts to the  cattle  industry exceeding $6 billion. As a consequence of a number of risk management interventions implemented by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and provincial agencies, the BSE outbreak appears to have been largely contained. The initial results from our study of the socioeconomic and psychosocial impact of BSE on the health and well-being of rural and farm families living in Canada, a topic that remains largely unexamined are presented. Our analysis of the outbreak raises a number of questions concerning the resulting consequences for farmers, their families, and their communities, including considerations from a social determinants' of health perspective. In particular, our preliminary findings reveal that 5 years following the detection of the first indigenous case of BSE in Canada, ongoing uncertainty and stress resulting from unrecoverable financial losses continue to weigh heavily on the health and well-being of farmers, their families, and survival and sustainability of agricultural communities.",M1
19697246,"Canadian media representations of mad cow disease.A Canadian case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) or  mad cow disease  was confirmed in May, 2003. An in-depth content analysis of newspaper articles was conducted to understand the portrayal of BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the Canadian media. Articles in the  first 10 days  following the initial discovery of a cow with BSE in Canada on May 20, 2003, were examined based on the premise that these initial stories provide the major frames that dominate news media reporting of the same issue over time and multiple occurrences. Subsequent confirmed Canadian cases were similarly analyzed to determine if coverage changed in these later media articles. The results include a prominence of economic articles, de-emphasis of health aspects, and anchoring the Canadian outbreak to that of Britain's crisis. The variation in media representations between those in Canada and those documented in Britain are explored in this study.",M1
19697245,"International case studies of psychosocial ripple effects of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in European countries.The public is increasingly concerned about risks associated with food. Food-borne diseases can easily mobilize public concerns and create strong emotional, behavioral, and political reactions with significant negative economic and psychosocial outcomes. This was observed in various countries globally experiencing the presence of prion disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This study highlights case-study material from various countries for key psychosocial impacts such as the public's worry and fear vis-a-vis beef consumption and the loss of confidence and trust in authorities stemming from the occurrence and management of the BSE crisis. These psychosocial impacts and resultant public behavioral responses are presented at a number of levels including individual, family, community, and societal for several European countries, with special emphasis on the UK case study. Given failures to identify the scope of individual concern about prion diseases, and to address these concerns in decision-making processes and risk communication strategies, there remains a need for further systematic research and psychosocial monitoring of the ripple effects of BSE.",M1
19697244,"Cow-calf producers need to blame exchange rates, not bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for lost wealth.Several studies examined the impacts of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) crisis on the Canadian agricultural sector. However, few investigations determined the on-farm financial repercussions arising from the crisis. This study examined impacts at farm level attributed to the BSE crisis. Cash flow and hedonic price models were used to examine changes in farm wealth for the years 2002 through 2007. While BSE received substantial media coverage, little attention was given to exchange rates and land values. Data demonstrated that exchange-rate fluctuations exerted a much greater impact on producer wealth than did the BSE crisis. Both farm equity and land values temporarily dipped following the BSE crisis but have since followed their previous trend. If the United States had not closed its borders to Canadian beef and cattle exports, producers would have an additional 0.65% growth in wealth. However, had exchange rates remained constant, farmers would have an additional 10.75% increase in equity. Consequently, the BSE crisis produced a smaller impact on farmer wealth than factors that received less media attention.",M1
19697243,"Surviving bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>): farm women's discussion of the effects of BSE on food provisioning practices.The economic vulnerability of beef and other farm families following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis in Canada poses a risk to their household food provisioning practices. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of BSE since 2003 on the food provisioning practices of beef and other farm families in three Canadian provinces. Semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted with 22 farm women (6 in Alberta, 6 in Ontario, and 10 in Nova Scotia) that focused on their food provisioning strategies. Women also provided basic sociodemographic information about their households. While the farm women interviewed revealed that BSE exerted a financial impact on their farm operation, it did not prevent them from eating foods that they valued as wholesome, safe, and healthy for their family. There was no hesitancy in consuming beef from Canadian sources; in fact, beef consumption often increased because of decisions to keep slaughtered cows for home consumption rather than accept low cull cow prices. Other food provisioning strategies reported included seeking out alternative markets, purchasing food on credit, and directing off-farm income to purchase food.",M1
19697233,"Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes from Peyer's patches of cattle orally challenged with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.The most likely route of entry of infection following oral exposure to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) is via the immunologically active Peyer's patches (PP). These secondary lymphoid organs appear to be the potential route for prion neuroinvasion. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the uptake of the infectious prion agent and progression of disease remain still unclear. This investigation examined the changes in gene expression in PP following oral exposure of cattle to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) agents. The gene expression patterns in PP from cows 12 mo after BSE challenge were compared with controls using a microarray platform containing 24,000 oligonucleotides representing 16,846 unique gene loci and 5943 Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) from bovine genome. Between the challanged and control animals, 90 genes and 16 EST were identified as significantly differentially, expressed (&gt;2.0-fold change): 36 were upregulated and 70 were downregulated. Of these genes, five were found to be related to immune function. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, MHC class II DQ alpha, L-RAP, and two hypothetical proteins. Differentially expressed genes related to cellular and metabolic processes including development and maturation of cells in the PP were also identified. In this context, the potential impacts of these gene expression changes in PP on BSE development are discussed.",M1
19681270,"Impact of potential changes to the current bovine spongiform encephalopathy surveillance programs for slaughter cattle and fallen stock in Japan.Cattle slaughtered in Japan for human consumption, regardless of their age, have been tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) since October 2001. Beginning in April 2004, all fallen stock from 24 months of age also have been tested. We evaluated the impact of potential changes to the current BSE surveillance programs for both slaughter cattle and fallen stock using a simple stochastic model. We calculated the probability that a BSE-infected dairy cow, Wagyu beef animal, Wagyu-Holstein cross steer or heifer, or Holstein steer slaughtered for human consumption or arising as fallen stock would be tested and detected. Four surveillance strategies were explored for cattle slaughtered for human consumption, with the minimum age at testing set at 0, 21, 31, or 41 months. Three surveillance strategies were explored for fallen stock, with the minimum age at testing set at 24, 31, or 41 months. Increasing the minimum age of testing from 0 to 21 months for both dairy cattle and Wagyu beef cattle had very little impact on the probability that a BSE-infected animal slaughtered for human consumption would be detected. Although increasing the minimum age at testing from 21 to 31 or 41 months would lead to fewer slaughtered animals being tested, the impact on the probability of detecting infected animals would be insignificant. The probability of infected Wagyu-Holstein crosses and Holstein steers being detected at slaughter or as fallen stock would be very low under all surveillance strategies.",M1
19658106,"Autoantibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein in the sera of cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.It is desirable to make the diagnosis in live cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>), and thus surrogate markers for the disease have been eagerly sought. Serum proteins from BSE cattle were analyzed by 2-D Western blotting and TOF-MS. Autoantibodies against proteins in cytoskeletal fractions prepared from normal bovine brains were found in the sera of BSE cattle. The protein recognized was identified to be glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is expressed mainly in astrocytes in the brain. The antigen protein, GFAP, was also found in the sera of BSE cattle. The percentages of both positive sera in the autoantibody and GFAP were 44.0% for the BSE cattle, 0% for the healthy cattle, and 5.0% for the clinically suspected BSE-negative cattle. A significant relationship between the presence of GFAP and the expression of its autoantibody in the serum was recognized in the BSE cattle. These findings suggest a leakage of GFAP into the peripheral blood during neurodegeneration associated with BSE, accompanied by the autoantibody production, and might be useful in understanding the pathogenesis and in developing a serological diagnosis of BSE in live cattle.",M1
19656962,"Transmissions of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from brain and lymphoreticular tissue show uniform and conserved bovine spongiform encephalopathy-related phenotypic properties on primary and secondary passage in wild-type mice.Prion strains are defined by their biological properties after transmission to wild-type mice, specifically by their incubation periods and patterns of vacuolar pathology ('lesion profiles'). Preliminary results from transmissions of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) to wild-type mice provided the first compelling evidence for the close similarity of the vCJD agent to the agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>). Complete results from this investigation, including the transmission characteristics of vCJD from brain and peripheral tissues of 10 cases (after primary transmission and subsequent mouse-to-mouse passage), have now been analysed. All 10 vCJD sources resulted in consistent incubation periods and lesion profiles, suggesting that all 10 patients were infected with the same strain of agent. Incubation periods suggested that infectious titres may be subject to regional variation within the brain. Comparison of incubation periods and lesion profiles from transmission of brain and peripheral tissues showed no evidence of tissue-specific modification in the biological properties of the agent. Analysis of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) by Western blotting from primary and subsequent passages in mice showed a glycosylation pattern closely resembling that of vCJD in humans, the so-called BSE 'glycoform signature'. Minor variations in PrP(res) fragment size were evident between mouse strains carrying different alleles of the gene encoding PrP both in primary transmissions and on further passages of vCJD brain. Overall, the results closely resembled those of previously reported transmissions of BSE in the same mouse strains, consistent with BSE being the origin of all of these vCJD cases.",M1
19636413,"Evaluation of the possible transmission of <e>BSE</e> and scrapie to gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many species, the key event in disease pathogenesis is the accumulation of an abnormal conformational isoform (PrP(Sc)) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). While the precise mechanism of the PrP(C) to PrP(Sc) conversion is not understood, it is clear that host PrP(C) expression is a prerequisite for effective infectious prion propagation. Although there have been many studies on TSEs in mammalian species, little is known about TSE pathogenesis in fish. Here we show that while gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) orally challenged with brain homogenates prepared either from a BSE infected cow or from scrapie infected sheep developed no clinical prion disease, the brains of TSE-fed fish sampled two years after challenge did show signs of neurodegeneration and accumulation of deposits that reacted positively with antibodies raised against sea bream PrP. The control groups, fed with brains from uninfected animals, showed no such signs. Remarkably, the deposits developed much more rapidly and extensively in fish inoculated with BSE-infected material than in the ones challenged with the scrapie-infected brain homogenate, with numerous deposits being proteinase K-resistant. These plaque-like aggregates exhibited congophilia and birefringence in polarized light, consistent with an amyloid-like component. The neurodegeneration and abnormal deposition in the brains of fish challenged with prion, especially BSE, raises concerns about the potential risk to public health. As fish aquaculture is an economically important industry providing high protein nutrition for humans and other mammalian species, the prospect of farmed fish being contaminated with infectious mammalian PrP(Sc), or of a prion disease developing in farmed fish is alarming and requires further evaluation.",M1
19635142,"Immunohistochemical and biochemical characteristics of <e>BSE</e> and CWD in experimentally infected European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus).BACKGROUND: The cause of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the United Kingdom (UK) was the inclusion of contaminated meat and bone meal in the protein rations fed to cattle. Those rations were not restricted to cattle but were also fed to other livestock including farmed and free living deer. Although there are no reported cases to date of natural BSE in European deer, BSE has been shown to be naturally or experimentally transmissible to a wide range of different ungulate species. Moreover, several species of North America's cervids are highly susceptible to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that has become endemic. Should BSE infection have been introduced into the UK deer population, the CWD precedent could suggest that there is a danger for spread and maintenance of the disease in both free living and captive UK deer populations. This study compares the immunohistochemical and biochemical characteristics of BSE and CWD in experimentally-infected European red deer (Cervus elpahus elaphus). RESULTS: After intracerebral or alimentary challenge, BSE in red deer more closely resembled natural infection in cattle rather than experimental BSE in small ruminants, due to the lack of accumulation of abnormal PrP in lymphoid tissues. In this respect it was different from CWD, and although the neuropathological features of both diseases were similar, BSE could be clearly differentiated from CWD by immunohistochemical and Western blotting methods currently in routine use. CONCLUSION: Red deer are susceptible to both BSE and CWD infection, but the resulting disease phenotypes are distinct and clearly distinguishable.",M1

However, a number of sheep challenged orally or intracerebrally with BSE were clinically asymptomatic and found to survive or were diagnosed as BSE-negative when culled. Sequencing of the full PRNP gene open reading frame of BSE-susceptible and -resistant sheep indicated that, in the majority of Suffolk sheep, resistance was associated with an M112T PRNP variant (TARQ allele). A high proportion (47 of 49; 96%) of BSE-challenged wild-type (MARQ/MARQ) Suffolk sheep were BSE-infected, whereas none of the 20 sheep with at least one TARQ allele succumbed to BSE. Thirteen TARQ-carrying sheep challenged with BSE are still alive and some have survival periods equivalent to, or greater than, reported incubation periods of BSE in ARR/ARR and VRQ/VRQ sheep.",M1
19587050,"Transcriptional changes in the brains of cattle orally infected with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent precede detection of infectivity.Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) is a fatal, transmissible, neurodegenerative disease of cattle. BSE can be transmitted experimentally between cattle through the oral route, and in this study, brain tissue samples from animals at different time points postinoculation were analyzed for changes in gene expression. The aims of this study were to identify differentially regulated genes during the progression of BSE using microarray-based gene expression profiling and to understand the effect of prion pathogenesis on gene expression. A total of 114 genes were found to be differentially regulated over the time course of the infection, and many of these 114 genes encode proteins involved in immune response, apoptosis, cell adhesion, stress response, and transcription. This study also revealed a broad correlation between gene expression profiles and the progression of BSE in cattle. At 21 months postinoculation, the largest number of differentially regulated genes was detected, suggesting that there are many pathogenic processes in the animal brain even prior to the detection of infectivity in the central nervous systems of these orally infected cattle. Moreover, evidence is presented to suggest that it is possible to predict the infectious status of animals using the expression profiles from this study.",M1
19473293,"Abnormal prion protein is associated with changes of plasma membranes and endocytosis in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>)-affected cattle brains.AIMS: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of man and animals characterized by vacuolation and gliosis of neuropil and the accumulation of abnormal isoforms of a host protein known as prion protein (PrP). It is widely assumed that the abnormal isoforms of PrP (PrP(d), disease-specific form of PrP) are the proximate cause of neurodegeneration. METHODS: To determine the nature of subcellular changes and their association with PrP(d) we perfusion-fixed brains of eight bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-affected cows and three control cattle for immunogold electron microscopy at two different neuroanatomical sites. RESULTS: All affected cattle presented plasma membrane alterations of dendrites and astrocytes that were labelled for PrP(d). PrP(d) on membranes of dendrites and occasionally of neuronal perikarya was associated with abnormal endocytotic events, including bizarre coated pits and invagination of the plasma membrane. BSE-affected cattle also presented excess and abnormal multivesicular bodies, sometimes associated to the plasma membrane perturbations. In contrast, two TSE-specific lesions, vacuolation and rare tubulovesicular bodies, were not labelled for PrP(d) as were a number of other nonspecific lesions, such as autophagy and dystrophic neurites. At least two different morphological pathways to vacuoles were recognized. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with other TSEs, these changes are common to those of sheep and rodent scrapie and shows that there are consistent membrane toxicity properties of PrP(d). This toxicity involves an aberration of endocytosis. However, it is by no means clear that the lesions are of sufficient severity to result in clinical deficits.",M1
19470160,"Biochemical typing of pathological prion protein in aging cattle with <e>BSE</e>.BACKGROUND: The broad enforcement of active surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2000 led to the discovery of previously unnoticed, atypical BSE phenotypes in aged cattle that differed from classical BSE (C-type) in biochemical properties of the pathological prion protein. Depending on the molecular mass and the degree of glycosylation of its proteinase K resistant core fragment (PrPres), mainly determined in samples derived from the medulla oblongata, these atypical cases are currently classified into low (L)-type or high (H)-type BSE. In the present study we address the question to what extent such atypical BSE cases are part of the BSE epidemic in Switzerland. RESULTS: To this end we analyzed the biochemical PrPres type by Western blot in a total of 33 BSE cases in cattle with a minimum age of eight years, targeting up to ten different brain regions. Our work confirmed H-type BSE in a zebu but classified all other cases as C-type BSE; indicating a very low incidence of H- and L-type BSE in Switzerland. It was documented for the first time that the biochemical PrPres type was consistent across different brain regions of aging animals with C-type and H-type BSE, i.e. independent of the neuroanatomical structure investigated. CONCLUSION: Taken together this study provides further characteristics of the BSE epidemic in Switzerland and generates new baseline data for the definition of C- and H-type BSE phenotypes, thereby underpinning the notion that they indeed represent distinct prion disease entities.",M1
19459939,"Hyperefficient PrP Sc amplification of mouse-adapted <e>BSE</e> and scrapie strain by protein misfolding cyclic amplification technique.Abnormal forms of prion protein (PrP(Sc)) accumulate via structural conversion of normal PrP (PrP(C)) in the progression of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Under cell-free conditions, the process can be efficiently replicated using in vitro PrP(Sc) amplification methods, including protein misfolding cyclic amplification. These methods enable ultrasensitive detection of PrP(Sc); however, there remain difficulties in utilizing them in practice. For example, to date, several rounds of protein misfolding cyclic amplification have been necessary to reach maximal sensitivity, which not only take several weeks, but also result in an increased risk of contamination. In this study, we sought to further promote the rate of PrP(Sc) amplification in the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technique using mouse transmissible spongiform encephalopathy models infected with either mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mouse-adapted scrapie, Chandler strain. Here, we demonstrate that appropriate regulation of sonication dramatically accelerates PrP(Sc) amplification in both strains. In fact, we reached maximum sensitivity, allowing the ultrasensitive detection of &lt; 1 LD(50) of PrP(Sc) in the diluted brain homogenates, after only one or two reaction rounds, and in addition, we detected PrP(Sc) in the plasma of mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected mice. We believe that these results will advance the establishment of a fast, ultrasensitive diagnostic test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.",M1
19414204,"Modelling the trend of bovine spongiform encephalopathy prevalence in France: Use of restricted cubic spline regression in age-period-cohort models to estimate the efficiency of control measures.An age-period-cohort (APC) analysis was used to assess the trend in prevalence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in France over time in relation to the control measures adopted since onset of the epidemic. Restricted cubic regression splines were used to model the functional forms of the non-linear effects of age at screening, birth cohort and date of diagnosis of the tested animals. The data of the 2001-2007 period of surveillance was analysed using 1-year categorisation. A categorical analysis was performed as control to check the accuracy of the sets of knots in the spline models, which were selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Knot selection was based on a priori knowledge of the disease and the dates of implementation of the five main BSE control measures. It was assumed that disease prevalence was a function of exposure to BSE and that changes in the exposure of cattle to BSE were mainly due to the control measures. The effects of the five main control measures were discussed in relation to the trend in BSE risk for the successive birth cohorts. The six selected models confirmed that all measures participated in disease control. However, characterization of the respective effect of individual measures was not straightforward due to the very low disease prevalence, incompletely tested cohorts and probably cumulative and overlapping effects of successive measures. The ban of importation of meat and bone meal (MBM) from the UK and the ban of use of MBM in bovines were insufficient to control the epidemic. The decline in the BSE epidemic more likely originated from implementation of the ban of MBM use in all ruminants in 1994, whose effect was probably reinforced by the evolution in perception of the BSE risk following evidence of BSE transmission to humans. Finally, the respective effects of the last two measures (prohibition of the use of specific risk material in 1996 and total MBM ban in 2000) could not be characterized as they were implemented when the disease trend was already in strong decline.",M1
19401179,"Altered expression of CRMPs in the brain of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected mice during disease progression.While recent studies suggest that synaptic alterations are first events in the mechanisms of prion-mediated neurodegeneration, little is known on the identity of the neuronal plasticity-related genes potentially concerned.

At the terminal stage of the disease, gene expression of each CRMP had decreased, while at the mid-stage of the disease only CRMP4 (mRNA and protein) expression had increased, concomitant to the start of PrP(Sc) accumulation in the brainstem. Altogether our findings picked out originally CRMPs, and especially CRMP4, as potential contributors to prion pathogenesis.",M1
19388556,"Broadening spectrum of bovine spongiform encephalopathies.Until recently the etiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) was considered uniform. The infectious agent was thought to be a single strain of prion (posttranslationally altered form of normal prion protein: PrPSc) retaining its biochemical and biological characteristics during interspecies transmission. However, alternate PrPSc signatures through large-scale screening have recently been detected. In addition, genetic alterations governing susceptibility to prion infection and a mutation (E211K) capable of eliciting spontaneous BSE have been demonstrated. Thus, the spectrum of BSEs have broadened and three PrPSc variants (BSE-C, BSE-H and BSE-L) are now defined. Moreover, a new condition resembling BSE, idiopathic brainstem neuronal chromatolysis (IBNC), has been described that may also turn out to be a prion disease. Since one of the new BSE variants, L-type BSE, proved highly pathogenic detection and further characterization of the new conditions are essential.",M1

This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies instituted by the European Commission. In a Monte Carlo simulation model, a non-intervention baseline scenario was compared to three intervention strategies: removal of specified risk materials from slaughter animals, post-mortem testing for BSE and the culling of feed and age cohorts of BSE cases. The food risk in the baseline scenario ranged from 16.98 lost life years in 2002 to 2.69 lost life years in 2005. Removing specified risk materials removal practices, post-mortem testing and post-mortem testing plus cohort culling reduced this risk with 93%, 82.7% and 83.1%. The estimated cost-effectiveness of all BSE measures in The Netherlands ranged from 4.3 million euros per life year saved in 2002 to 17.7 million euros in 2005. It was discussed that the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies will further deviate from regular health economics thresholds as BSE prevalence and incidence declines.",M1

As a result, a further 28 cases were detected in dairy cattle. Using the mathematical model previously developed and surveillance data up to the end of 2008, we estimated the prevalence of BSE-infected animals within each birth cohort for the years 1995-2001. We predicted historic and future trends in the number of BSE-infected animals to be culled and anticipated BSE cases from each birth cohort. The results indicate that more infected animals (428 (95% CI: 59-727)) than previously estimated would have been culled from 1995 to 2001, and more cases (53 (95% CI: 25-101)) than previously predicted would have been detected during this period with a higher peak in 2001, if a BSE surveillance program as comprehensive as the present one was applied. In and after 2009, 0-2 cases of BSE would likely to be detected. As previously predicted, the BSE epidemic should be eradicated by 2012.",M1

The model allowed the evolution of the unobserved cases to be estimated differentiating the population into two subgroups: (1) livestock slaughtered for human consumption without clinical signs and (2) cattle at increased risk (including fallen stock, clinical suspects, emergency slaughtered cattle and cattle with clinical signs at ante mortem inspection). If the first bovine affected by BSE had been introduced into the region in 1986, the model predicted that during the period of study the surveillance system would detect a median of 197 outbreaks (2.5-97.5 percentiles: 157-245).

19285121,"Early dysfunction of central 5-HT system in a murine model of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.The hypothesis of an early vulnerability of the serotonergic system to prion infection was investigated in a murine model of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>). Behavioral tests targeted to 5-HT functions were performed in the course of infection to evaluate circadian activity, anxiety-like behavior, pain sensitivity and the 5-HT syndrome. The first behavioral change was a decrease in nocturnal activity detected at 30% of incubation time. Further behavioral alterations including nocturnal hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, hyperalgesia and exaggerated 5-HT syndrome were observed at 60%-70% of incubation time, before the onset of clinical signs. The same tests performed in 5-HT-depleted mice and in prion protein-deficient mice revealed behavioral abnormalities similar in many aspects to those of BSE-infected mice. Histological and biochemical analysis showed alterations of the serotonergic system in BSE-infected and prion protein-deficient mice. These results indicate that BSE infection affects the homeostasis of serotonergic neurons and suggest that the disruption of prion protein normal function contributes to the early pathological changes in our mouse model of BSE. A similar process may occur in the human variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, as suggested by the early symptoms of alterations in mood, sleep and pain sensitivity.",M1
19264659,"Transmission of scrapie and sheep-passaged bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions to transgenic mice expressing elk prion protein.Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible, fatal prion disease of cervids and is largely confined to North America. The origin of CWD continues to pose a conundrum: does the disease arise spontaneously or result from some other naturally occurring reservoir? To address whether prions from sheep might be able to cause disease in cervids, we inoculated mice expressing the elk prion protein (PrP) transgene [Tg(ElkPrP) mice] with two scrapie prion isolates. The SSBP/1 scrapie isolate transmitted disease to Tg(ElkPrP) mice with a median incubation time of 270 days, but a second isolate failed to produce neurological dysfunction in these mice. Although prions from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) did not transmit to the Tg(ElkPrP) mice, they did transmit after being passaged through sheep. In Tg(ElkPrP) mice, the sheep-passaged BSE prions exhibited an incubation time of approximately 300 days. SSBP/1 prions produced abundant deposits of the disease-causing PrP isoform, denoted PrP(Sc), in the cerebellum and pons of Tg(ElkPrP) mice, whereas PrP(Sc) accumulation in Tg mice inoculated with sheep-passaged BSE prions was confined to the deep cerebellar nuclei, habenula and the brainstem.

Because there was no effective system to avoid recycling of the BSE agent via animal feed until the early 1990s, of the 33 cattle imported from the UK into Japan, most probably 7 or 8 were infected and entered the animal feed chain, 2 of which entered the animal feed chain in each of 1992 and 1993. In terms of infectivity, 400-550 cattle oral ID(50) of the BSE agent entered the feed chain in each of these years. The amount of infectivity that entered the feed chain in 1989, 1991 and 1995 was smaller but still substantial, suggesting that the BSE agent might have entered the Japanese feed chain in any of these years.",M1

Our findings suggest that friends, relatives and acquaintances mutually orientated each other about what was worth knowing about BSE. Concerning the behavioral dimension of risk judgments, our findings indicate that social networks obtained within the village explored have activated collective resistance against fear. This is explained by the character of the risk source. Positive attitudes towards conventional farming obviously contributed to the social identity of villagers. The devaluation of conventional farming as a source of societal threat by the mass media touched on an integral part of the self-definitions of villagers and activated resistance within their social networks. It is argued that a central point in explaining the role of interpersonal influence in risk judgments is not only the dimension of risk judgments but the character of the risk source. If attitudes concerning a risk source contribute positively to one's identity, the devaluation of the risk source by mass media coverage may enhance the probability of collective resistance against fear.",M1

The human disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, arose during the BSE epidemic, and oral exposure of humans to BSE-infected tissues has been implicated in its aetiology. The concern is that sheep BSE could provide another source of BSE exposure to humans via sheep products. Two immunological techniques, Western immunoblotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), have been developed to distinguish scrapie from cases of experimental sheep BSE by the characteristics of their respective abnormal, disease-associated prion proteins (PrP(d)). This study compares the WB and IHC characteristics of PrP(d) from brains of primary, secondary and tertiary experimental ovine BSE cases with those of cattle BSE and natural sheep scrapie.

19207266,"Pathogenetical significance of porencephalic lesions associated with intracerebral inoculation of sheep with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) agent.Decreased rates of transmission of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) to sheep have been attributed to some polymorphisms of the prion protein (PrP) and to a 'species barrier' on interspecies experiments. In addition, the blood-brain barrier may be a further impediment to TSE neuroinvasion. The intracerebral (I/C) route is generally considered the most efficient for TSE transmission, as it may help to bypass those factors. Therefore, susceptibility of particular species to specific TSE agents is conducted by this route. AIMS: This study characterizes the traumatic brain lesions associated with the I/C injection of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent in sheep, assesses the relevance of such lesions in the outcome of clinical disease and provides insight into the mechanisms of PrP(d) conversion and amplification following I/C challenge. METHODS: A total of 27 hemibrains have been macroscopically and immunohistochemically examined to investigate the presence of lesions compatible with the needle track and the PrP(d) distribution, respectively. RESULTS: No residual inoculum was found and the extension and severity of the traumatic brain lesions were unrelated to the clinical outcome. Sheep with PrP(d) accumulation in the brain also showed conspicuous focal aggregates in the porencephalic lesions and in the circumventricular organs. In contrast, sheep without PrP(d) deposits in the brain were also negative in the traumatic lesions. CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings suggest that the efficiency of the I/C route is due to effective absorption and blood recirculation of infection, rather than to primary amplification at the site of injection.",M1
19192234,"The impact of social amplification and attenuation of risk and the public reaction to mad cow disease in Canada.Following the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in Canada, and subsequently in the United States, confidence in the safety of beef products remained high. Consumers actually increased their consumption of beef slightly after the news of an increased risk from mad cow disease, which has been interpreted as public support for beef farmers and confidence in government regulators. The Canadian public showed a markedly different reaction to the news of domestic BSE than the furious and panicked responses observed in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Using the social amplification of risk framework, we show that, while other countries displayed social amplification of risk, Canada experienced a social attenuation of risk. The attenuated reaction in Canada toward mad cow disease and increased human health risks from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was due to the social context at the time when BSE was discovered domestically. Mortality, morbidity, and psychosocial impacts resulting from other major events such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus (WNV), and the U.S.-Iraq war made the theoretical risks of BSE and vCJD a lower priority, reducing its concern as a risk issue.",M1
19158500,"Biological and biochemical characterization of L-type-like bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) detected in Japanese black beef cattle.A case of L-type-like atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy was detected in 14-year-old Japanese black beef cattle (BSE/JP24). To clarify the biological and biochemical properties of the prion in BSE/JP24, we performed a transmission study with wild-type mice and bovinized transgenic mice (TgBoPrP). The BSE/JP24 prion was transmitted to TgBoPrP mice with the incubation period of 199.7 +/- 3.4 days, which was shorter than that of classical BSE (C-BSE) (223.5 +/- 13.5 days). Further, C-BSE was transmitted to wild-type mice with the incubation period of about 409 days, whereas BSE/JP24 prion inoculated mice showed no clinical signs up to 649 days. Severe vacuolation and a widespread and uniform distribution of PrP(Sc) were pathologically observed in the brain of BSE/JP24 prion affected TgBoPrP mice. The molecular weight and glycoform ratio of PrP(Sc) in BSE/JP24 were different from those in C-BSE, and PrP(Sc) in BSE/JP24 exhibited weaker proteinase K resistance than that in C-BSE. These findings revealed that the BSE/JP24 prion has distinct biological and biochemical properties reported for that of C-BSE. Interestingly, a shorter incubation period was observed at the subsequent passage of the BSE/JP24 prion to TgBoPrP mice (152.2 +/- 3.1 days). This result implies that BSE/JP24 prion has newly emerged and showed the possibility that L-type BSE prion might be classified into multiple strains.",M1
19146499,"Assessing the presence of <e>BSE</e> and scrapie in slaughterhouse wastewater.AIMS: This paper describes a procedure for evaluating the presence and the stability of the proteinase K-resistant form of the prion protein (PrP(res)) in slaughterhouse wastewater. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wastewater samples were spiked with either scrapie or bovine spongiform encephalopathy agents and PrP(res) was concentrated and detected by western blotting. The detection limit was estimated to be 2-4 microg of either scrapie or BSE-infected brain tissue in 15 ml of sewage. Wastewater samples from three abattoirs were analysed, two of which had processed BSE-infected animals. No PrP(res) was detected. The effect of sewage on the inoculum and the persistence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents in wastewater were also considered. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the assay suggest that wastewaters from abattoirs where one positive BSE case has been identified would contain titres lower than 0.6-26 x 10(-4) cattle oral ID(50) per litre resulting from specified risk material tissue contamination. Moreover, the effect of abattoir wastewaters is to reduce the persistence of PrP(res). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay may be a useful tool for risk assessment studies and for reducing the potential risk of contamination with BSE via sewage sludge fertilizer procedures.",M1
19144064,"The <e>BSE</e> risk of processing meat and bone meal in nonruminant feed: a quantitative assessment for the Netherlands.The total ban on use of meat and bone meal (MBM) in livestock feed has been very successful in reducing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) spread, but also implies a waste of high-quality proteins resulting in economic and ecological loss. Now that the BSE epidemic is fading out, a partial lifting of the MBM ban might be considered. The objective of this study was to assess the BSE risk for the Netherlands if MBM derived from animals fit for human consumption, i.e., category 3 MBM, would be used in nonruminant feed. A stochastic simulation model was constructed that calculates (1) the probability that infectivity of undetected BSE-infected cows ends up with calves and (2) the quantity of infectivity (Q(inf)) consumed by calves in case of such an incident. Three pathways were considered via which infectivity can reach cattle: (1) cross-contamination in the feed mill, (2) cross-contamination on the primary farm, and (3) pasture contamination. Model calculations indicate that the overall probability that infectivity ends up with calves is 3.2%. In most such incidents the Q(inf) is extremely small (median = 6.5 x 10(-12) ID(50); mean = 1.8 x 10(-4) ID(50)), corresponding to an average probability of 1.3 x 10(-4) that an incident results in &gt;or=1 new BSE infections. Cross-contamination in the feed mill is the most risky pathway. Combining model results with Dutch BSE prevalence estimates for the coming years, it can be concluded that the BSE risk of using category 3 MBM derived from Dutch cattle in nonruminant feed is very low.",M1

The intensity of immunolabeling was greatest in the brainstem, but PrP(Sc) was also detected in the olfactory bulb and the cerebral cortex. A diffuse, nonparticulate labeling, possibly due to abundance of cellular PrP, was consistently observed in the olfactory glomeruli of the cases and negative controls. Involvement of the olfactory bulb in BSE and other naturally occurring TSEs of animals raises speculation as to an olfactory portal of infection or a route of excretion of the prion agent.",M1

The progressive prolongation of peak latency of waves III and V was observed right-and-left bilaterally at the onset of neurological symptoms. The peak latency of wave V and the I-V interpeak latency (IPL) in BSE cattle 22 and 24 months after intracerebral inoculation were significantly (P&lt;0.05) prolonged compared with the control cattle. In addition, the amplitude of the BAEP waves of the BSE cattle were low compared with the control cattle.

19074787,"Epidemiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle in Hokkaido, Japan, between September 2001 and December 2006.Between October 2001 and December 2006 an estimated total of 6 million cattle in Japan were tested for <e>BSE</e>, with 31 returning a positive result. Exploratory mapping, the space-time scan statistic, and ordinal logistic regression have been used to describe the epidemiology of the 24 cases identified in the prefecture of Hokkaido, and to quantify the risk factors for the disease. Two birth cohort groups were affected: cattle born during a period of seven months in 1996, and cattle born between 1999 and 2001. The descriptive spatial analyses showed that eight of the 10 cases born in 1996 were born in areas with a relatively high density of dairy farms in the east of Hokkaido, but that the 14 later cases were more widely distributed throughout the prefecture, with equal numbers of cases in the east and the west. These findings provide indirect evidence of a single localised contamination of the cattle feed supply in 1996, and recycling of the infection after 1999.",M1
19059996,"Disease-specific motifs can be identified in circulating nucleic acids from live elk and cattle infected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.To gain insight into the disease progression of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), we searched for disease-specific patterns in circulating nucleic acids (CNA) in elk and cattle. In a 25-month time-course experiment, CNAs were isolated from blood samples of 24 elk (Cervus elaphus) orally challenged with chronic wasting disease (CWD) infectious material. In a separate experiment, blood-sample CNAs from 29 experimental cattle (Bos taurus) 40 months post-inoculation with clinical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) were analyzed according to the same protocol. Next-generation sequencing provided broad elucidation of sample CNAs: we detected infection-specific sequences as early as 11 months in elk (i.e. at least 3 months before the appearance of the first clinical signs) and we established CNA patterns related to BSE in cattle at least 4 months prior to clinical signs. In elk, a progression of CNA sequence patterns was found to precede and correlate with macro-observable disease progression, including delayed CWD progression in elk with PrP genotype LM. Some of the patterns identified contain transcription-factor-binding sites linked to endogenous retroviral integration. These patterns suggest that retroviruses may be connected to the manifestation of TSEs. Our results may become useful for the early diagnosis of TSE in live elk and cattle.",M1
19057142,"Evaluation of methods for removing central nervous system tissue contamination from the surface of beef carcasses after splitting.Since high levels of prions, the causative agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>), accumulate in the brain and spinal cord, contamination of beef carcasses with central nervous system tissue (CNST) may occur at post-slaughter process. In this study, we investigated CNST contamination on the surface of beef carcasses using glial fibrillary acidic protein as a marker after splitting and evaluated the effects of washing procedures on contamination removal. High levels of CNST contamination was detected immediately after splitting, especially in the area close to the spinal column. This suggests that spinal cord fragments are attached to carcasses at the time of splitting even though the spinal cords have been removed by vacuum before splitting. Steam cleaning or manually washing with normal pressure water around the spinal column, performed prior to washing with high-pressure water, was found to be effective for reducing the level of CNST contamination. Furthermore, manually washing with high-pressure water could reduce CNST contamination to almost negligible levels. These results are useful for preparation of appropriate sanitation standard operating procedures to reduce the risk of CNST contamination of carcasses for prevention of exposure to BSE prion via the food chain.",M1
19053160,"High-resolution differentiation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy strains by quantitative N-terminal amino acid profiling (N-TAAP) of PK-digested abnormal prion protein.New forms of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) continue to be identified, and consequently sensitive differential diagnosis is increasingly important both for the management of disease in humans and livestock and in providing confidence in the safety of the food chain. TSE diseases are associated with accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(Sc)) and detection of this marker protein is central to diagnosis. Proteolysis by proteinase K (PK) generates protease-resistant products (PrP(res)) with partially variable N-termini. The conformation(s) of PrP(Sc) and thus the points of PK cleavage are thought to be dependent on the strain of prion disease. Western blot (WB) analysis of PrP(res) gives characteristic migration patterns that can be used to diagnose TSEs, but the relatively low resolution of this technique limits its ability to differentiate certain disease strains. Mass spectrometry (MS) has the capability to resolve these various PK cleavage sites to the level of individual amino acid residues. In the present study multiple selected reaction monitoring (mSRM) was used to detect and quantify PrP(res) N-terminal tryptic peptides by MS and thus to define the N-terminal amino acid profiles (N-TAAPs) of PrP(res) characteristic for various TSEs in sheep. The fragmentation behaviour of the N-terminal tryptic peptides was studied to allow selection of the transitions specific for each peptide. Different PrP(res) preparation methods were evaluated and the most effective approach applied to differentiate the N-TAAPs corresponding to various sheep TSE isolates. Marked differences were identified between the N-TAAPs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) and classical scrapie, and between classical scrapie and the experimental strains SSBP/1 and CH1641, thereby validating this approach as a means of TSE-strain specific diagnosis.",M1

19008948,"Resistance of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) prions to inactivation.Distinct prion strains often exhibit different incubation periods and patterns of neuropathological lesions. Strain characteristics are generally retained upon intraspecies transmission, but may change on transmission to another species. We investigated the inactivation of two related prions strains: BSE prions from cattle and mouse-passaged BSE prions, termed 301V. Inactivation was manipulated by exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), variations in pH, and different temperatures. Infectivity was measured using transgenic mouse lines that are highly susceptible to either BSE or 301V prions. Bioassays demonstrated that BSE prions are up to 1,000-fold more resistant to inactivation than 301V prions while Western immunoblotting showed that short acidic SDS treatments reduced protease-resistant PrP(Sc) from BSE prions and 301V prions at similar rates. Our findings argue that despite being derived from BSE prions, mouse 301V prions are not necessarily a reliable model for cattle BSE prions. Extending these comparisons to human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and hamster Sc237 prions, we found that BSE prions were 10- and 10(6)-fold more resistant to inactivation, respectively. Our studies contend that any prion inactivation procedures must be validated by bioassay against the prion strain for which they are intended to be used.",M1

Estimations of the titre of infectivity in central nervous system (CNS), certain peripheral nerve ganglia and distal ileum tissue were made according to time post exposure from the relationship between incubation period and dose for RIII mice and C57bl mice using data from titrations of brain material from cases of BSE. The rate of increase of infectivity in the bovine CNS was then estimated, taking into account these tissue infectivity titres, the variability of the brain titre of clinical field cases of BSE, and the probability density of the expected number of months before clinical onset of each infected bovine. The doubling time for CNS was shown to equal 1.2 months. The titre in the thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was, on average, approximately 1 log units less than CNS, and cervical DRG approximately 0.5 log less than thoracic DRG. The pattern of increase of infectivity in the distal ileum is that of an initial increase up to 14-18 months post exposure, followed by a decrease, which is likely to be highly variable between animals. These results will be informative for future risk assessments of BSE, especially in relation to reviewing current control measures.",M1
18855247,"Detection of bovine central nervous system tissue as bovine spongiform encephalopathy risk material by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR in raw and cooked beef products.There is increasing evidence of the association of the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (nvCJD) in humans with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) in cattle. Many countries established legislation of banning central nervous system (CNS) tissues, which are regarded as BSE-specified risk materials (SRM), in human food supply because of the potential transmission of BSE to humans. A real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay using the bovine glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA template for the detection of CNS tissues in raw and cooked beef products was developed in this study. The results showed that (1) this method can detect CNS tissues from bovine and ovine origins, but not from porcine and avian ones; (2) GFAP mRNA can only be detected from brain and spinal cords rather than other tissues; (3) the GFAP mRNA was detectable in CNS tissues even after dilution to 0.001%; and (4) the assay was unaffected by heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 30 min or storage at room temperature for 4 days, and at 4 degrees C for at least 15 days.",M1
18818029,"Continuous monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy rapid test performance by weak positive tissue controls and quality control charts.Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) rapid tests and routine BSE-testing laboratories underlie strict regulations for approval. Due to the lack of BSE-positive control samples, however, full assay validation at the level of individual test runs and continuous monitoring of test performance on-site is difficult. Most rapid tests use synthetic prion protein peptides, but it is not known to which extend they reflect the assay performance on field samples, and whether they are sufficient to indicate on-site assay quality problems. To address this question we compared the test scores of the provided kit peptide controls to those of standardized weak BSE-positive tissue samples in individual test runs as well as continuously over time by quality control charts in two widely used BSE rapid tests. Our results reveal only a weak correlation between the weak positive tissue control and the peptide control scores. We identified kit-lot related shifts in the assay performances that were not reflected by the peptide control scores. Vice versa, not all shifts indicated by the peptide control scores indeed reflected a shift in the assay performance. In conclusion these data highlight that the use of the kit peptide controls for continuous quality control purposes may result in unjustified rejection or acceptance of test runs. However, standardized weak positive tissue controls in combination with Shewhart-CUSUM control charts appear to be reliable in continuously monitoring assay performance on-site to identify undesired deviations.",M1
18808703,"Frequencies of polymorphisms associated with <e>BSE</e> resistance differ significantly between Bos taurus, Bos indicus, and composite cattle.BACKGROUND: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases that affect several mammalian species. At least three factors related to the host prion protein are known to modulate susceptibility or resistance to a TSE: amino acid sequence, atypical number of octapeptide repeats, and expression level. These factors have been extensively studied in breeds of Bos taurus cattle in relation to classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). However, little is currently known about these factors in Bos indicus purebred or B. indicus x B. taurus composite cattle. The goal of our study was to establish the frequency of markers associated with enhanced susceptibility or resistance to classical BSE in B. indicus purebred and composite cattle. RESULTS: No novel or TSE-associated PRNP-encoded amino acid polymorphisms were observed for B. indicus purebred and composite cattle, and all had the typical number of octapeptide repeats. However, differences were observed in the frequencies of the 23-bp and 12-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms associated with two bovine PRNP transcription regulatory sites. Compared to B. taurus, B. indicus purebred and composite cattle had a significantly lower frequency of 23-bp insertion alleles and homozygous genotypes. Conversely, B. indicus purebred cattle had a significantly higher frequency of 12-bp insertion alleles and homozygous genotypes in relation to both B. taurus and composite cattle. The origin of these disparities can be attributed to a significantly different haplotype structure within each species. CONCLUSION: The frequencies of the 23-bp and 12-bp indels were significantly different between B. indicus and B. taurus cattle. No other known or potential risk factors were detected for the B. indicus purebred and composite cattle. To date, no consensus exists regarding which bovine PRNP indel region is more influential with respect to classical BSE. Should one particular indel region and associated genotypes prove more influential with respect to the incidence of classical BSE, differences regarding overall susceptibility and resistance for B. indicus and B. taurus cattle may be elucidated.",M1
18800704,"[NIRS method for determination of meat and bone meal content in ruminant concentrates]Feed contaminated with MBM is commonly accepted as the main transmission carrier of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>). To prevent BSE many countries have banned MBM as a feed ingredient. In the People's Republic of China, the ban was first applied to ruminant feed. In order to investigate the feasibility of near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy method for rapidly quantitative determination of meat and bone meal content in ruminant concentrates, 225 representatively commercial ruminant concentrates samples and 75 meat and bone meal (including cattle, sheep, pig and poultry meat and bone meal) samples were collected in the People's Republic of China. Two hundred twenty five ruminant concentrates samples of adulterated meat and bone meal (0.5%-35%) were prepared including 135 calibration samples and 90 independent validation samples. For the calibration set samples, 3 samples were prepared at each concentration. For validation set samples, 2 samples were prepared at each concentration. Any one commercial ruminant concentrates was used once only. The spectra were scanned by raster near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy instrument, and the effect of spectrum pretreatment methods (mathematic pretreatments and scatter correction) and spectrum region (visible and NIR) on the calibration results was considered. The calibration equation was established by modified partial least squares method. The result showed that the calibration gave r2 of 0.979, a standard error of calibration (SEC) of 1.522% and a standard error of cross validation (SECV) of 1.582%. The 90 independent validation samples were used to validate the quantitative equation. The r2, a standard error of prediction (SEP) and ratio of performance to standard deviation (RPD) were 0.972, 1.764% and 5.99 respectively. The results of this study indicated that near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy method could provide rapidly quantitative prediction for meat and bone meal percent in ruminant concentrates. This method was significant in practice for enriching the rapidly quantitative methods of determining animal feed materials.",M1

Studies in recent years have demonstrated a similar effect of PRNP promoter and intron-1 polymorphisms on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) susceptibility in cattle. In this study, the deletion/insertion (indel) polymorphisms of the bovine PRNP gene within the promoter sequence (23 bp) and intron 1 (12 bp) were analyzed in local Turkish cattle. For this, 150 animals belonging to three different local breeds--the South Anatolian red, the East Anatolian red, and the Turkish gray--were tested using DNA purification and polymerase chain reaction. The ins allele in the 12 bp indel, which is associated with low susceptibility to BSE, showed a high frequency in all three breeds. The low-susceptibility allele of the 23-bp indel was identified in Turkish gray cattle with a frequency of 0.80. Results of the study have shown that local Turkish cattle might have an important genetic value for selection against BSE.",M1

In this study, properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were investigated in boTg110 transgenic mice over-expressing the bovine cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) and infected with BSE. Using immunohistochemistry with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin as a specific marker for perineuronal nets (PNNs) and antibodies against aggrecan and hyaluronic acid binding protein, loss of ECM was correlated with PrP(BSE) accumulation and activation of astrocytes and microglia. PrP(BSE) accumulation and glial cell activation were detected from the earliest stages of the disease and increased in the terminal stages. Decreases in PNNs, aggrecan and hyaluronic acid were observed only in the terminal stages and correlated with the distribution of PrP(BSE) and activated glial cells. This study suggests that the loss of PNNs, aggrecan and hyaluronic acid is a consequence of PrP(BSE) accumulation. Degradation of ECM in BSE may be due to secretion of degradative enzymes by activated glial cells.",M1

It is the most likely cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. The origin of BSE remains an enigma. Here we report an H-type BSE case associated with the novel mutation E211K within the prion protein gene (Prnp). Sequence analysis revealed that the animal with H-type BSE was heterozygous at Prnp nucleotides 631 through 633. An identical pathogenic mutation at the homologous codon position (E200K) in the human Prnp has been described as the most common cause of genetic CJD. This finding represents the first report of a confirmed case of BSE with a potential pathogenic mutation within the bovine Prnp gene. A recent epidemiological study revealed that the K211 allele was not detected in 6062 cattle from commercial beef processing plants and 42 cattle breeds, indicating an extremely low prevalence of the E211K variant (less than 1 in 2000) in cattle.",M1
18769714,"A C-terminal protease-resistant prion fragment distinguishes ovine  CH1641-like  scrapie from bovine classical and L-Type <e>BSE</e> in ovine transgenic mice.The protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) of a few natural scrapie isolates identified in sheep, reminiscent of the experimental isolate CH1641 derived from a British natural scrapie case, showed partial molecular similarities to ovine bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Recent discovery of an atypical form of BSE in cattle, L-type BSE or BASE, suggests that also this form of BSE might have been transmitted to sheep. We studied by Western blot the molecular features of PrP(res) in four  CH1641-like  natural scrapie isolates after transmission in an ovine transgenic model (TgOvPrP4), to see if  CH1641-like  isolates might be linked to L-type BSE. We found less diglycosylated PrP(res) than in classical BSE, but similar glycoform proportions and apparent molecular masses of the usual PrP(res) form (PrP(res) #1) to L-type BSE. However, the  CH1641-like  isolates differed from both L-type and classical BSE by an abundant, C-terminally cleaved PrP(res) product (PrP(res) #2) specifically recognised by a C-terminal antibody (SAF84). Differential immunoprecipitation of PrP(res) #1 and PrP(res) #2 resulted in enrichment in PrP(res) #2, and demonstrated the presence of mono- and diglycosylated PrP(res) products. PrP(res) #2 could not be obtained from several experimental scrapie sources (SSBP1, 79A, Chandler, C506M3) in TgOvPrP4 mice, but was identified in the 87V scrapie strain and, in lower and variable proportions, in 5 of 5 natural scrapie isolates with different molecular features to CH1641. PrP(res) #2 identification provides an additional method for the molecular discrimination of prion strains, and demonstrates differences between  CH1641-like  ovine scrapie and bovine L-type BSE transmitted in an ovine transgenic mouse model.",M1
18714385,"Atypical <e>BSE</e> (BASE) transmitted from asymptomatic aging cattle to a primate.BACKGROUND: Human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) results from foodborne transmission of prions from slaughtered cattle with classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (cBSE). Atypical forms of BSE, which remain mostly asymptomatic in aging cattle, were recently identified at slaughterhouses throughout Europe and North America, raising a question about human susceptibility to these new prion strains. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Brain homogenates from cattle with classical BSE and atypical (BASE) infections were inoculated intracerebrally into cynomolgus monkeys (Macacca fascicularis), a non-human primate model previously demonstrated to be susceptible to the original strain of cBSE. The resulting diseases were compared in terms of clinical signs, histology and biochemistry of the abnormal prion protein (PrPres). The single monkey infected with BASE had a shorter survival, and a different clinical evolution, histopathology, and prion protein (PrPres) pattern than was observed for either classical BSE or vCJD-inoculated animals. Also, the biochemical signature of PrPres in the BASE-inoculated animal was found to have a higher proteinase K sensitivity of the octa-repeat region. We found the same biochemical signature in three of four human patients with sporadic CJD and an MM type 2 PrP genotype who lived in the same country as the infected bovine. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results point to a possibly higher degree of pathogenicity of BASE than classical BSE in primates and also raise a question about a possible link to one uncommon subset of cases of apparently sporadic CJD. Thus, despite the waning epidemic of classical BSE, the occurrence of atypical strains should temper the urge to relax measures currently in place to protect public health from accidental contamination by BSE-contaminated products.",M1
18698417,"Prion infected meat-and-bone meal is still infectious after biodiesel production.The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) has led to a world-wide drop in the market for beef by-products, such as Meat-and-Bone Meal (MBM), a fat-containing but mainly proteinaceaous product traditionally used as an animal feed supplement. While normal rendering is insufficient, the production of biodiesel from MBM has been suggested to destroy infectivity from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In addition to producing fuel, this method simultaneously generates a nutritious solid residue. In our study we produced biodiesel from MBM under defined conditions using a modified form of alkaline methanolysis. We evaluated the presence of prion in the three resulting phases of the biodiesel reaction (Biodiesel, Glycerol and Solid Residue) in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the reaction products from 263K scrapie infected MBM led to no detectable immunoreactivity by Western Blot. Importantly, and in contrast to the biochemical results the solid MBM residue from the reaction retained infectivity when tested in an animal bioassay. Histochemical analysis of hamster brains inoculated with the solid residue showed typical spongiform degeneration and vacuolation. Re-inoculation of these brains into a new cohort of hamsters led to onset of clinical scrapie symptoms within 75 days, suggesting that the specific infectivity of the prion protein was not changed during the biodiesel process. The biodiesel reaction cannot be considered a viable prion decontamination method for MBM, although we observed increased survival time of hamsters and reduced infectivity greater than 6 log orders in the solid MBM residue. Furthermore, results from our study compare for the first time prion detection by Western Blot versus an infectivity bioassay for analysis of biodiesel reaction products. We could show that biochemical analysis alone is insufficient for detection of prion infectivity after a biodiesel process.",M1
18698343,"Identification of a heritable polymorphism in bovine PRNP associated with genetic transmissible spongiform encephalopathy: evidence of heritable <e>BSE</e>.BACKGROUND: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of cattle. Classical BSE is associated with ingestion of BSE-contaminated feedstuffs. H- and L-type BSE, collectively known as atypical BSE, differ from classical BSE by displaying a different disease phenotype and they have not been linked to the consumption of contaminated feed. Interestingly, the 2006 US H-type atypical BSE animal had a polymorphism at codon 211 of the bovine prion gene resulting in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution (E211K). This substitution is analogous a human polymorphism associated with the most prevalent form of heritable TSE in humans, and it is considered to have caused BSE in the 2006 US atypical BSE animal. In order to determine if this amino acid change is a heritable trait in cattle, we sequenced the prion alleles of the only known offspring of this animal, a 2-year-old heifer. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis revealed that both the 2006 US atypical BSE animal and its 2-year-old heifer were heterozygous at bovine prion gene nucleotides 631 through 633 for GAA (glutamic acid) and AAA (lysine). Both animals carry the E211K polymorphism, indicating that the allele is heritable and may persist within the cattle population. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that the E211K polymorphism is a germline polymorphism, not a somatic mutation, suggesting BSE may be transmitted genetically in cattle. In the event that E211K proves to result in a genetic form of BSE, this would be the first indication that all 3 etiologic forms of TSEs (spontaneous, hereditary, and infectious) are present in a non-human species. Atypical BSE arising as both genetic and spontaneous disease, in the context of reports that at least some forms of atypical BSE can convert to classical BSE in mice, suggests a cattle origin for classical BSE.",M1
18687157,"Control of scrapie in the UK sheep population.Scrapie is a fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep, endemic in the UK for centuries. Interest in the disease has been heightened over the last decade by the possibility of the related <e>BSE</e> being transmissible to and between sheep and a range of control interventions has been proposed and implemented. In this paper, we examined the effect of these policies and their components on observed case rate, susceptible allele frequency and R0 within the framework of a large simulation model of the British sheep population and its breeding and trading structure. We compared interventions with the natural fade-out of scrapie in the population through loss of susceptible genotypes in the absence of control. We compare the results of interventions with the natural course of the scrapie epidemic. Our model suggested that scrapie will persist in the national flock for 300-400 years with the impact on gene frequencies confined largely to high case-rate breeds, such as Shetland and Swaledale. We found the National Scrapie Plan (NSP) to be the most effective in terms of the removal of both susceptible genotypes and scrapie from the population. Complete eradication of scrapie can be achieved within 32 years (95% CI 23-43 years). The Compulsory Scrapie Flock Scheme (CSFS) is as effective as the NSP in reducing the observed case rate but has a limited impact on the frequencies of susceptible genotypes in the population overall. In combination with the NSP, eradication of scrapie is achieved &gt;10 years faster. Of the components of the CSFS, the breeding and culling aspects are each almost as effective as the full policy, with trading restrictions contributing little. We have speculated on the impact of control measures on the possibility BSE infection within the national flock by examining their effect on flock R0 for BSE across different breeds.",M1
18650661,"Potential effect of excluding variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease on the eye donor pool in Australia.PURPOSE: To quantitate the likely effect on the available eye donor pool by excluding potential donors who may have had exposure to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by virtue of spending time in countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) is endemic. METHODS: A telephone survey by systematic sampling from the Brisbane phone directory was undertaken to ascertain the number of potential donors who had resided in the United Kingdom and in other countries. RESULTS: Between 19% of potential donors would have had to have been excluded by virtue of residing in the United Kingdom for &gt;6 months between 1980 and 1996 and 29% for those who had traveled to any other country in which BSE was identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that adopting an eye bank policy of excluding donors potentially exposed to BSE would have a significant effect on donor numbers. Health departments and eye banks will need to weigh the small additional protection from such policy decisions against the likely effect on corneal tissue supply.",M1
18647958,"Prion diseases are efficiently transmitted by blood transfusion in sheep.The emergence of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, following on from the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) epidemic, led to concerns about the potential risk of iatrogenic transmission of disease by blood transfusion and the introduction of costly control measures to protect blood supplies. We previously reported preliminary data demonstrating the transmission of BSE and natural scrapie by blood transfusion in sheep. The final results of this experiment, reported here, give unexpectedly high transmission rates by transfusion of 36% for BSE and 43% for scrapie. A proportion of BSE-infected transfusion recipients (3 of 8) survived for up to 7 years without showing clinical signs of disease. The majority of transmissions resulted from blood collected from donors at more than 50% of the estimated incubation period. The high transmission rates and relatively short and consistent incubation periods in clinically positive recipients suggest that infectivity titers in blood were substantial and/or that blood transfusion is an efficient method of transmission. This experiment has established the value of using sheep as a model for studying transmission of variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease by blood products in humans.",M1
18643829,"Preventive health behavior and adaptive accuracy of risk perceptions.This study examined the relation between health behavior and risk perceptions in the context of an acute livestock epidemic. Participants in a longitudinal web-based survey (N= 195) were asked to report their meat consumption and their perceived risk in relation to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) and other related livestock diseases. Cross-sectional analyses at both measurement points (T1 and T2) showed that participants with low levels of preventive nutrition (high meat consumption) felt more at risk for BSE-related diseases than those reporting comparable higher levels of preventive behavior (low meat consumption), indicating relative accuracy. These results suggest that people recognize when their behavior is risky. More importantly, perceived risk also showed adaptive accuracy from a change perspective: increases in preventive nutrition from T1 to T2 were significantly associated with decreases in perceived risk between T1 and T2. Possible foundations and implications of an adaptive accuracy of risk perceptions are discussed.",M1
18625065,"Prevalence of the prion protein gene E211K variant in U.S. cattle.BACKGROUND: In 2006, an atypical U.S. case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) was discovered in Alabama and later reported to be polymorphic for glutamate (E) and lysine (K) codons at position 211 in the bovine prion protein gene (Prnp) coding sequence. A bovine E211K mutation is important because it is analogous to the most common pathogenic mutation in humans (E200K) which causes hereditary Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease, an autosomal dominant form of prion disease. The present report describes a high-throughput matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay for scoring the Prnp E211K variant and its use to determine an upper limit for the K211 allele frequency in U.S. cattle. RESULTS: The K211 allele was not detected in 6062 cattle, including those from five commercial beef processing plants (3892 carcasses) and 2170 registered cattle from 42 breeds. Multiple nearby polymorphisms in Prnp coding sequence of 1456 diverse purebred cattle (42 breeds) did not interfere with scoring E211 or K211 alleles. Based on these results, the upper bounds for prevalence of the E211K variant was estimated to be extremely low, less than 1 in 2000 cattle (Bayesian analysis based on 95% quantile of the posterior distribution with a uniform prior). CONCLUSION: No groups or breeds of U.S. cattle are presently known to harbor the Prnp K211 allele. Because a carrier was not detected, the number of additional atypical BSE cases with K211 will also be vanishingly low.",M1
18620407,"Fluorescence-based method, exploiting lipofuscin, for real-time detection of central nervous system tissues on bovine carcasses.The removal of central nervous system (CNS) tissues as part of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) risk material is one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with BSE. No currently available method enables the real-time detection of possible CNS tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter. The fluorescent pigment lipofuscin is a heterogeneous, high-molecular weight material that has been shown to be enriched in high concentrations in neuronal tissues. In this study, lipofuscin fluorescence was investigated as a marker for real-time detection of CNS contamination. Front-faced fluorescence spectra of brain and spinal cord samples from 11 cattle gave identical, reproducible fluorescence signal patterns with high intensities. The specificity of these spectra was assessed by investigating 13 different non-CNS tissues enabling the differentiation of brain and spinal cord by signal intensity and structure of the spectra, respectively. Small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle, fat, and vertebrae. The presented data are a fundamental basis for the development of a prototype device allowing real-time monitoring of CNS tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts.",M1
18599859,"A collaborative Canadian-United Kingdom evaluation of an immunohistochemistry protocol to diagnose bovine spongiform encephalopathy.Collaboration was established in 2001 to evaluate a commercially available immunohistochemistry assay kit for the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) disease-associated prion protein in formic acid-treated formalin-fixed samples of bovine brain. The kit protocol was evaluated at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases (Winnipeg, Canada) and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge, U.K.). The U.K. laboratory provided paraffin-embedded blocks of brainstem (medulla oblongata at the level of the obex) from 100 positive cases defined by clinical signs and histopathology, and 100 clinically suspect but BSE-negative samples defined by histopathology and immunohistochemistry with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody R145. The Canadian laboratory provided 400 blocks from surveillance cases defined as clinically suspect but negative by histopathology and immunohistochemistry with anti-PrP antibody 6H4. Consecutive sections from each block were cut and coded. Each set of 600 slides was immunolabeled and read in each laboratory. Evaluation parameters included estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and reproducibility of the results. The kit performed with 100% sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility in spite of minor differences between the laboratories in brain sample areas, fixation and processing, and in the immunolabeling protocol. Although enzyme linked immunosorbent assays are widely used in high throughput surveillance programs, standardized protocols and reagents for manual immunohistochemistry provide a useful adjunct to surveillance efforts, particularly in laboratories testing small numbers of samples or using immunohistochemistry for confirmation and characterization of BSE cases.",M1
18591154,"Investigation of close interactions between sympathetic neural fibres and the follicular dendritic cells network in the mouse spleen.In this study, co-localization between sympathetic neural fibres and the follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) network was observed within the mouse spleen by confocal technology. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to reveal the rare interactions between the FDCs network and sympathetic neural fibres. We estimated the frequency of three kinds of close interactions which could be defined as overlaps, contacts or neural fibres closer than 10 microm from a FDCs network. Using these estimates, a comparison was made between five uninfected mouse strains exhibiting the same Prnpa genotype but showing different incubation periods when inoculated with primary bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>)-infected brain. In prion disease, infectivity is generally detected in the spleen much earlier than in the brain, especially after peripheral inoculation. The way by which the infectious agent reaches the central nervous system is still unclear. From the five mouse strains, we obtained differences in the proportion of splenic FDCs networks with close interactions. Our work suggests that the percentage of splenic FDCs networks with at least one sympathetic neural fibre in close vicinity may influence the length of incubation period.",M1
18585368,"Spontaneous and <e>BSE</e>-prion-seeded amyloid formation of full length recombinant bovine prion protein.The conversion of the cellular isoform of the prion protein into the pathogenic isoform PrP(Sc) is the key event in prion diseases. The disease can occur spontaneously genetically or by infection. In earlier studies we presented an in vitro conversion system which simulates the structural transition in recPrP by varying low concentrations of SDS at constant NaCl. In the present study we adopted the conversion system from experimental Scrapie in hamster to bovine recPrP and generated amyloid fibrils. The intermediate state which is optimal for fibril formation is a soluble, beta-rich state. The system was extended using BSE-prions as seeds and led to an acceleration of fibril formation by orders of magnitude. This seeded amyloid formation assay avoids any PK-treatment, is therefore able to detect even PK-sensitive PrP(Sc) and does not require cellular components.",M1
18559085,"Spatial analysis of <e>BSE</e> cases in the Netherlands.BACKGROUND: In many of the European countries affected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), case clustering patterns have been observed. Most of these patterns have been interpreted in terms of heterogeneities in exposure of cattle to the BSE agent. Here we investigate whether spatial clustering is present in the Dutch BSE case data. RESULTS: We have found three spatial case clusters in the Dutch BSE epidemic. The clusters are geographically distinct and each cluster appears in a different birth cohort. When testing all birth cohorts together, only one significant cluster was detected. The fact that we found stronger spatial clustering when using a cohort-based analysis, is consistent with the evidence that most BSE infections occur in animals less than 12 or 18 months old. CONCLUSION: Significant spatial case clustering is present in the Dutch BSE epidemic. The spatial clusters of BSE cases are most likely due to time-dependent heterogeneities in exposure related to feed production.",M1

18513278,"Characterization of a 320-kb region containing the HEXA gene on bovine chromosome 10 and analysis of its association with <e>BSE</e> susceptibility.Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) belongs to a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as transmissible prion diseases. Recently, variants in the promoter region of the prion protein (PRNP) gene have been shown to have a considerable effect on the susceptibility to BSE. However, a previous genome scan revealed other putative BSE-susceptibility loci. Here, we analysed such a region on BTA10, which contains the functional candidate gene HEXA. Three hundred and twenty kilobases that, besides HEXA, also contain ARIH1, BRUNOL6 and PARP6 were characterized and screened for polymorphisms. Genotyping of 38 SNPs in Holstein-Friesian animals from the UK (350 diseased and 270 controls) revealed two intronic SNPs that were associated with BSE incidence, with experiment-wise P-values of 3.5 x 10(-3) and 7.7 x 10(-3) respectively. Both SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium and the rare alleles had a protective effect. These alleles were contained in a haplotype dubbed 'UK-protective' that was significantly overrepresented in the controls with a permuted P-value of 2 x 10(-3). An association study in German Holstein animals (73 diseased and 627 controls) revealed an opposite effect of the 'UK-protective' haplotype in this population, i.e. it was overrepresented in the diseased animals, although not significant after correction for multiple testing. These findings indicate a causal variant for BSE susceptibility on BTA10 in linkage disequilibrium with the markers studied. Candidate gene analyses of the surrounding region and additional association studies will help to clarify the origin of the protective effects and to identify causal variants for BSE susceptibility on BTA10.",M1
18511392,"Mad cows and computer models: the U.S. response to <e>BSE</e>.The proportion of slaughtered cattle tested for BSE is much smaller in the U.S. than in Europe and Japan, leaving the U.S. heavily dependent on statistical models to estimate both the current prevalence and the spread of BSE. We examine the models relied on by USDA, finding that the prevalence model provides only a rough estimate, due to limited data availability. Reassuring forecasts from the model of the spread of BSE depend on the arbitrary constraint that worst-case values are assumed by only one of 17 key parameters at a time. In three of the six published scenarios with multiple worst-case parameter values, there is at least a 25% probability that BSE will spread rapidly. In public policy terms, reliance on potentially flawed models can be seen as a gamble that no serious BSE outbreak will occur. Statistical modeling at this level of abstraction, with its myriad, compound uncertainties, is no substitute for precautionary policies to protect public health against the threat of epidemics such as BSE.",M1
18507844,"Experimental transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus).BACKGROUND: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>), a member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), primarily affects cattle. Transmission is via concentrate feed rations contaminated with infected meat and bone meal (MBM). In addition to cattle, other food animal species are susceptible to BSE and also pose a potential threat to human health as consumption of infected meat products is the cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, which is invariably fatal. In the UK, farmed and free ranging deer were almost certainly exposed to BSE infected MBM in proprietary feeds prior to legislation banning its inclusion. Therefore, although BSE has never been diagnosed in any deer species, a possible risk to human health remains via ingestion of cervine products. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), also a TSE, naturally infects several cervid species in North America and is spreading rapidly in both captive and free-ranging populations. RESULTS: Here we show that European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) are susceptible to intra-cerebral (i/c) challenge with BSE positive cattle brain pool material resulting in clinical neurological disease and weight loss by 794-1290 days and the clinical signs are indistinguishable to those reported in deer with CWD. Spongiform changes typical of TSE infections were present in brain and accumulation of the disease-associated abnormal prion protein (PrPd) was present in the central and peripheral nervous systems, but not in lymphoid or other tissues. Western immunoblot analysis of brain material showed a similar glycosylation pattern to that of BSE derived from infected cattle and experimentally infected sheep with respect to protease-resistant PrP isoforms. However, the di-, mono- and unglycosylated bands migrated significantly (p &lt; 0.001) further in the samples from the clinically affected deer when compared to BSE infected brains of cattle and sheep. CONCLUSION: This study shows that deer are susceptible to BSE by intra-cerebral inoculation and display clinical signs and vacuolar pathology that are similar to those of CWD. These findings highlight the importance of preventing the spread to Europe of CWD from North America as this may necessitate even more extensive testing of animal tissues destined for human consumption within the EU. Although the absence of PrPd in lymphoid and other non-neurological tissues potentially limits the risk of transmission to humans, the replication of TSE agents in peripheral tissues following intra-cerebral challenge is often limited. Thus the assessment of risk posed by cervine BSE as a human pathogen or for environmental contamination should await the outcome of ongoing oral challenge experiments.",M1
18505676,"Coordinate regulation of bovine prion protein gene promoter activity by two Sp1 binding site polymorphisms.Relationships between insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphisms of the bovine prion protein gene (PRNP) promoter and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) susceptibility have been reported. Our previous study has shown that polymorphisms of -6C--&gt;T included in the specific protein 1 (Sp1) site in the 5'-flanking region of bovine PRNP influence the promoter activity of bovine PRNP. The present study shows that 12 and 23bp Ins/Del polymorphisms in the upstream region and an additional polymorphism (-47C--&gt;A) in the Sp1 binding site coordinately affect the promoter activity. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that the bovine PRNP promoter containing -47A and 23bp Del/12bp Ins or 23bp Ins/12bp Ins showed lower promoter activity compared with other haplotypes (23bp Del/12bp Ins or 23bp Ins/12bp Del with -47C) or the wild-type haplotype (23bp Del/12bp Del with -47C). Furthermore, gel shift assays showed that the binding activity of Sp1 to the PRNP promoter was influenced by both polymorphisms with corresponding effects on the promoter activity. The coordinate regulation of the bovine PRNP promoter suggests the two Sp1 binding site polymorphisms control Sp1 binding to the PRNP promoter and its activity.",M1
18503615,"alpha-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein is not a suitable marker for a screening test for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.BACKGROUND: A test is needed to identify blood donors who are in the preclinical phase of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). alpha-Hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP; syn. ERAF, EDRF) transcript levels are reduced in the blood of mice incubating transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure AHSP transcript and protein levels in normal blood donors, patients with CJD, and patients with other neuronal and hematologic diseases. Temporal AHSP expression was measured in sheep incubating bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>). RESULTS: Quantitation of AHSP in peripheral blood from normal blood donors revealed that protein levels, but not transcript levels, are influenced by sex with higher levels found in males, suggesting posttranslational regulation involving the product of an X-linked gene. When AHSP mRNA and protein levels were quantitated in peripheral blood from patients with variant and sporadic CJD, no consistent differences from normal were found. Serial quantitation of AHSP in individual BSE-infected sheep did not reveal any disease-related changes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that quantitation of AHSP is not likely to be useful for detection of preclinical prion disease in man.",M1
18497860,"Intraspecies transmission of BASE induces clinical dullness and amyotrophic changes.The disease phenotype of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) and the molecular/ biological properties of its prion strain, including the host range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years, systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted in the identification of at least two atypical forms of BSE. These emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine pathological prion protein (PrP(TSE)), named high-type (BSE-H) and low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a PrP(TSE) type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range. Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic changes accompanied by mental dullness. The molecular and neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely matched those observed in the original cases. This study provides clear evidence of BASE as a distinct prion isolate and discloses a novel disease phenotype in cattle.",M1

18484354,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy strain-associated diversity of N-terminal proteinase K cleavage sites of PrP(Sc) from scrapie-infected and bovine spongiform encephalopathy-infected mice.Assessment of the different conformational states of the abnormal prion protein (PrP(Sc)) in the CNS provides an established basis for distinguishing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) strains. PrP(Sc) conformers are variably resistant to N-terminal proteinase K (PK) digestion, and analysis of the consensus products (PrP(res)) by immunoassay enables effective, but relatively low-resolution differentiation. Determination of the precise N-terminal amino acid profile (N-TAAP) of PrP(res) presents a potential high-resolution means of TSE-strain typing, and thus of differential disease diagnosis. This approach was evaluated using individual mice affected by model scrapie (22A, ME7, 87V and 79A) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<e>BSE</e>) (301V) strains. Nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine PrP(res) N-terminal tryptic digestion products. Four major N-terminal tryptic peptides were generated from all mouse TSE strains investigated, corresponding with predominant N-termination of PrP(res) at G(81), G(85), G(89) and G(91). Both the mass spectrometric abundance of the individual peptides and the ratios of pairs of these peptides were evaluated as markers of conformation in relation to their potential for strain discrimination. The yield of peptides was significantly greater for BSE than scrapie strains and the relative quantities of particular peptide pairs differed between strains. Thus, whereas peptide G(91)-K(105) was a dominant peptide from 301V, this was not the case for other strains and, significantly, the ratio of peptides G(91)-K(105):G(89)-K(105) was substantially higher for BSE-infected compared with scrapie-infected mice. These data support the potential of the N-TAAP approach for high-resolution TSE strain typing and differential diagnosis.",M1

20104977,"Early detection for breast cancer in iran.OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) concerning early detection for breast cancer among Iranian health care providers (HCP). METHODS: Three hundred and eighteen HCPs were selected with stratified simple random sampling and given questionnaires to determine their baseline KAP for breast cancer early detection. Results were compared among categories of age, educational level, marriage status and professional experience with the Chi square test. RESULTS: For six knowledge questions, 71.8% participants had four or more correct responses, 80.5% agreed completely with 'women will accept the screening program if the physicians advise it'. However, 48% of female HCPs did not carry out any method of breast cancer screening for themselves during the last year; 81.5% did not carry out breast examinations for the majority of female outpatients and inpatients during last year; only 5.1% recommended breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) to more than 70% of their female patients.

Considering the HCP's role for implementing the national breast cancer control program, improvement in knowledge and attitudes is still important, but this may not be enough to reach to an appropriate level of desired practice.",M2
20104976,"Perceptions of breast health practices in Pakistani Muslim women.OBJECTIVE: Even though breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in females in Pakistan, there is a paucity of evidence on the views of Pakistani Muslim women in relation to breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the perceptions of Pakistani Muslim women in relation to the aetiology of breast cancer and impressions of breast health. The study took place in Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: This survey used a questionnaire and focus group interviews to investigate women's perspectives on breast health. Data was collected over a period of six months, quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 105 women participated in the questionnaire and 48 women contributed to 6 focus group interviews. Women generally were aware of the term breast cancer but were unsure of its aetiology. The questionnaire data revealed that women were aware of both mammography (55%) and breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) (77%). Fifty five percent of women had been taught the BSE technique. In comparison, the majority of women attending the focus group interviews had limited exposure to BSE or mammography. Although women had heard of mammograms and BSE they were unaware of BSE technique or breast cancer screening procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Even though there is a desire amongst women to engage in BSE by being taught the necessary technique and specific pathological changes to look for, there is a strong cultural opinion that breasts are private organs that should not be discussed publically. In view of this and the frequency of breast cancer in Pakistani Muslim women, it is essential that breast awareness campaigns are implemented by health care professionals such as breast cancer nurses, midwives and medical practitioners to explore the concept of BSE and breast cancer. Selective health education can educate women and lead to changes in health behavior.",M2
20104966,"Comparison of three educational interventions on breast self-examination knowledge and health beliefs.BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of various training methods for breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) knowledge, practice, and health beliefs. METHODS: The quasi-experimental investigation was carried out in an area where two community health care centers are located, in the city of Trabzon, Turkey. Divided randomly into three groups, 1,342 women were instructed in BSE using individual or group training or by way of pamphlets. Data were gathered in four stages: during the pretraining and one month, six months and twelve months after training. RESULTS: All of the training methods used in the study produced a significant increase in the participants' BSE knowledge, but individually trained women scored higher than did the others. Regardless of the training method, BSE instruction improved the women's perceived confidence and benefits, while their perceived barriers declined. The variables influencing BSE practice were found to be BSE practice at the pretraining period, perceived confidence in and benefits from BSE six months after BSE instruction, and health motivation one year after training. No significant difference was found in women's BSE performance scores one year after training. CONCLUSION: This study in which three training methods were used enabled us to assess the effectiveness of instruction on BSE performance and competence. In addition, it provided us with valuable information on how training methods can influence health beliefs related to BSE.",M2

The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 30 years and over; and able to read and write Farsi. Women with breast cancer, who were pregnant, or breast feeding, were excluded from the study. Data were collected by using a self administered questionnaire which included demographic characteristics and Champion's Health Belief Model Scale. This instrument measures the concepts of disease susceptibility (3 items), seriousness (6 items), benefits (4 items), barriers (8 items) and self-efficacy (10 items). RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 37.2 (SD = 6.1) years. Just under a third of the subjects (31.7%) had performed BSE in the past and 7.1% of them performed it at least monthly. Perceived benefits and perceived self-efficacy of the women who performed BSE were significantly higher compared with women who did not practice BSE (p &lt; 0.03). Furthermore, perceived barriers were lower among those who had performed BSE (p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that women who perceived fewer barriers (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.63-0.77, p &lt; 0.001) and had higher self-efficacy (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13, p = 0.003) were more likely to perform BSE (R2 = 0.52). CONCLUSION: Findings from this study indicated that perceived barriers and perceived self-efficacy could be predictors of BSE behavior among the sample of women. Therefore, BSE training programs that emphasize self-efficacy and address perceived barriers are recommended.",M2
19901842,"Breast self-examination and adherence to mammographic follow-up: an intriguing diptych after benign breast biopsy.This study evaluates the effect of palpability upon breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and adherence to annual mammogram after benign breast biopsy (BBB). Seven hundred and fifty-two women with palpable (WP, n = 359) or nonpalpable (WNP, n = 393) lesions were evaluated 2 years before and after BBB. BSE was considered adequate when it was performed at least once per month, and inadequate when it was performed with a frequency of less than once per month. Prebiopsy/postbiopsy adherence was characterized as inadequate when at least one session of mammographic examination was lost within the 2-prebiopsy/postbiopsy (including the last visit) years, respectively. The prebiopsy frequency of adequate BSE was higher in WP [49 (176 of 359) vs. 38.9% (153 of 393) for WNP; Pearson's chi2 (1) = 7.77, P = 0.005]. However, the opposite happened regarding the prebiopsy adherence to mammogram, as the frequency of adequate adherence was 64.1% (252 of 393) in WNP, but only 46.0% (165 of 359) in WP. After BBB, adherence to mammogram significantly increased in both groups, reaching 76.1% (299 of 393) for WNP and 65.2% (234 of 359) for WP. However, BSE increased significantly only in WNP. Regarding the WP group, the postBBB BSE did not exhibit any significant change. Noticeably, the aforementioned increase in BSE among WNP resulted in the disappearance of the initial WP-WNP discrepancy regarding BSE; the postBBB BSE did not differ between WP and WNP. However, concerning adherence to mammogram, the superiority of WNP versus WP persisted (76.1 vs. 65.2%, respectively). In conclusion WP and WNP may perceive BBB differently, as reflected upon the differentially modified patterns.",M2
19897514,"'If I feel something wrong, then I will get a mammogram': understanding barriers and facilitators for mammography screening among Chilean women.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer among women in Chile and in many Latin American countries. Breast cancer screening is an effective strategy to reduce mortality, but it has a very low compliance among Chilean women. OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers and facilitators for breast cancer screening in a group of Chilean women aged 50-70. METHODS: Following the Predisposing, Enabling and Reinforcing (PRECEDE) framework, seven focus groups (N = 48 women) were conducted with women that have had diverse experiences with breast cancer and screening practices. Information was collected using field notes and audio and video recording. Following the grounded theory model, a sequential process of open, axial and selective coding was used for the information analysis. Atlas ti 5.5 software was used for coding and segmenting the data obtained from the interviews. RESULTS: The presence of symptoms and/or the finding of lumps through breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) were the main predisposing factors for getting a mammogram. Secrecy, embarrassment and fatalism about breast cancer were significant cultural factors that influenced the decision to seek mammogram screening. Confidence in medical staff and dignity in the treatment at the clinic were important enabling factors. The main reinforcing factors for getting the test were a sense of fulfilment by doing something good for themselves and getting timely information about the results. CONCLUSIONS: Primary health care providers should use culturally appropriate strategies to better inform women about the importance of mammography screening and the limitations of BSE for preventing advanced breast cancer.",M2

METHOD: Seven volunteer peer educators were given the BSE training programme and in turn educated 65 women students in the university. BSE knowledge evaluation forms developed by Maurer were applied for evaluation. Other data were collected with questionnaires for the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Scale of Perceived Social Support over three months. RESULTS: Knowledge level points of students and the BSE practice ratio were increased by peer support. There was a positive relationship between average BSE knowledge points and social support and self-esteem. CONCLUSION: The results showed positive relationships among BSE knowledge, social support and self-esteem, these affecting the BSE performance level.",M2
19827877,"Do we need to maximise the breast cancer screening awareness? Experience with an endogamous society with high fertility.BACKGROUND: In the State of Qatar, breast cancer has become the most common form of cancer among women. The aim of this study was to explore knowledge, attitude and practice about breast cancer and to identify potential barriers to screening procedures among women. METHODS: This multistage sampling cross sectional survey in primary health care centers and the outpatient department of the Women's Hospital in the State of Qatar targeted a representative sample of 1,200 Qatari women aged between 30 to 55 years of age during the period from December 2008 to April 2009. A total 1,002 subjects (83.5%) consented to participation. Face to face interviews were conducted with a designed questionnaire covering knowledge about breast cancer, attitudes and practices of breast cancer screening. Socio-demographic variables were included. RESULTS: The majority of Qatari women demonstrated an adequate knowledge about breast cancer, with a significant relation to education status. Almost three quarters were aware that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. A good proportion knew that nipple retraction (81.2%) and discharge of blood (74.6%) are warning signs. Of the studied Qatari women, 24.9% identified breast self examination, 23.3% clinical breast examination (CBE) and 22.5% mammography as methods for detection of breast cancer. The frequently reported barriers among the Qatari women were asking any doctor/nurse how to perform breast self examination (57.3%), embarrassment about CBE (53.3%) and fear of mammography results (54.9%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that family history, level of education, living in an urban area and having medical check-ups when healthy were significant predictors for CBE and mammography. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed that although Qatari women had adequate general knowledge about breast cancer, the screening rates for <e>BSE</e>, CBE and mammography were low, these being performed most frequently by young Qatari women with a higher level of education.",M2
19800471,"Breast self-examination: defining a cohort still in need.BACKGROUND: The value of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) to detect early breast cancer is controversial. METHODS: Within an institutional review board-approved prospective study, 147 high-risk women were enrolled from 2004 to 2007. Yearly clinical examination, BSE teaching, and mammography were performed simultaneously followed by interval breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Women underwent additional BSE teaching at 6 months. Women reporting a mass on BSE underwent clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Fourteen breast cancers were detected in 12 women. BSE detected 6/14 breast cancers versus 6/14 detected by MRI and 2/14 by mammography. Of 24 masses detected by BSE, 6/24 were malignant. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of BSE to detect breast cancer were 58.3%, 87.4%, and 29.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a Breast Image Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score of &gt;or=4 on MRI were 66.7%, 88.9%, and 34.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BSE detects new breast cancers in high-risk women undergoing screening mammogram, CBE, and yearly breast MRI.",M2
19763009,"Knowledge and practice of breast-self examination among female undergraduate students of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, northwestern Nigeria.BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of the breast is an important public health problem in Nigeria and studies have reported low levels of awareness and practice of breast self examination as an important method of prevention. Breast self examination is a cost-effective method of early detection of cancer of the breast especially in resource poor countries. We assessed knowledge and practice of breast-self examination (<e>BSE</e>) among female undergraduate students of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Nigeria. METHOD: In this study, knowledge and practice of BSE were examined among 221 female students aged 16-28 years old studying at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria using self administered questionnaires. RESULTS: It was found that despite nearly three quarter of the respondents (87.7%) had heard of BSE, only 19.0% of them were performing this examination monthly. Regarding the sources of information about BSE among respondents, media was found to be most common followed by health workers accounting for 45.5% and 32.2% respectively. Regular performance of BSE was significantly correlated with duration of stay in the University (X2 = 81.9, df = 3, P 2 = 17.4, df = 2, P CONCLUSION: We observed a disparity between high levels of knowledge of BSE compared to a low level of practice.

19720341,"Breast cancer screening recommendations: is mammography the only answer?Early detection of breast cancer is important to reduce mortality and morbidity. Traditionally, three methods of breast screening were recommended: mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). At present, BSE and CBE are no longer widely recommended, while mammography is still broadly promoted in the Western world. The primary intent of this article is to examine whether current health policy recommendations related to breast cancer screening are informed by evidence. The issue of whether women are adequately aware of the potential benefits and risks of breast screening methods to make informed decisions is also discussed. It is argued that it is premature to caution women against BSE and CBE because the current evidence is inconclusive or incomplete. Moreover, women should be better informed about the potential harms associated with mammography screening. Recommendations for research and health policy are also discussed.",M2

AIMS: To determine the practices of nurses and midwives and their attitude toward breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). SETTING AND DESIGN: The descriptive survey was conducted to determine the practices of nurses and midwives and their attitude toward BSE. It tried to cover the total population rather than sampling part of it. However, 15 nurses and midwives, where there were errors detected in their data coding papers, and who did not accept to join the study, were excluded from the study. A total of 80 nurses and midwives were included in the study group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This survey was carried out at the State Hospital, all Public Health Cabins, and Family Health Centers, in the rural area of Izmir, a city located in the western region of Turkey. The data was collected between 15 March and 1 April 2004. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The analysis included descriptive statistics, to examine the association between BSE and medical history, knowledge of BSE, and attitude toward BSE. Results: The results of the study indicated that 52% of the sample performed BSE. Approximately 35% of those who performed BSE reported that they acquired information regarding BSE during their work experience. A significant relationship was found between higher levels of work experience and BSE practice. Except for age, no significant relation was found between the sociodemographic factors and BSE practice. The sample showed a strong belief in the breast lump being the cause of breast cancer and it had a significant correlation with BSE practice. CONCLUSION: A positive correlation was found between nursing work experience and their practice alongside BSE medical professionals. Almost all the nurses and midwives knew how to conduct BSE, but did not prioritize practicing it.",M2

This study was designed to assess the awareness of female health workers about risk factors and screening methods for early detection of breast cancer. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out among female health workers in the two major government health institutions in Benin City, Edo State capital in Nigeria.Data analysis was by SPSS version 10 and test of significance was done with differences considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-three (393) female health workers out of five hundred and five eligible subjects completed and returned the questionnaires, giving a response rate of 77.8%. One hundred and two (26%) were Doctors, two hundred and fifty-four (64.6%) Nurses, and thirty-seven (9.4%) were Radiographers, Laboratory Scientists and Pharmacists. A high proportion of our respondents had very poor knowledge about risk factors for breast cancer (55%). The awareness of mammography as a diagnostic method was very high (80.7%), but an extremely low knowledge of mammography as a screening method was found. Mammography practice of only 3.1% was found among those above 40 years of age who qualify for routine annual screening. Relatively low knowledge (45.5%) about Breast Self Examination (<e>BSE</e>) as a screening method was found. CONCLUSION: These female health workers who are expected to act as role models and educate the public had poor knowledge of risk factors for breast cancer and practice of breast cancer screening.

A total of 106 women who volunteered to participate in the study were trained in the technique of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) with the help of a lecture, video, demonstration of the technique on breast model by the investigator followed by feedback demonstration by the technique participants. Subsequently, short text messages (SMS) were sent according to the last menstrual period information collected. Women who did not menstruate were sent reminders on the first of every month. Statistical analysis was done using epinfo software. All the 106 participants owned a personal mobile number, while 89% had a private connection of cell phone and 11% had a connection provided by a government agency. Some 76 (71.7%) of the women had a regular menstrual period, 11 (10.3%) had an irregular menstrual period and 19(18%) had stopped menstruating either because of menopause, surgery or some medication. The delivery status of the SMS could be confirmed in majority of the instances. From amongst those who did not do the self exam the main barriers to BSE identified were that they forgot to do it and will do it now (54%), busy (47%), anxiety (12%), pain in the breasts (4%), and some question regarding the exam (4%). Multiple responses were included. After the first two months of sending reminder the practice of BSE increased significantly (p&lt;0.05).",M2

METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted at various faculties located in Ege University, Izmir, Turkey, in 2005. The sample consisted of 224 female academicians. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and the Turkish version of Champion's Health Belief Model Scales (HBM). Descriptive statistics, t-test and Mann Whitney u analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The percentage of participants who regularly performed BSE was 27.7 %. Benefits and health motivation related to BSE ranked either first or second, along with confidence. Perceived barriers to BSE had the lowest item mean subscale score in academicians. Single academicians perceived susceptibility and seriousness higher than their married counterparts. Family history of breast cancer of participants affected their health beliefs subscale. CONCLUSIONS: BSE performance among participants was more likely in women academicians who exhibited higher confidence and those who perceived fewer barriers related to BSE performance, complying with the conceptual structure of the HBM. Therefore, it is recommended that in order to increase the rates of regular breast cancer screening, mass health protective programs based on the HBM should be executed for women.",M2
19528300,"Knowledge and attitudes of breast self examination in a group of women in Shiraz, southern Iran.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related deaths among women worldwide. The disease in women occurs at a younger age in Iran than in western communities. OBJECTIVE: To determine the practice of breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) among 25-54-year-old women in Shiraz, southern Iran. METHODS: Using a stratified convenient sampling method, a total of 300 women aged 25-54 years who attended our health care centre between September 2006 and May 2007 were invited for an interview on BSE. All invited women accepted and were interviewed. The questions included demographic information, level of education, whether the participant performed BSE and, if yes, how and when. They were also asked about their source of information. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range (IQR)) age of participants was 38.5 (14) years. Of the 300 studied women, 283 (94.3%) were married; 160 (53.3%) performed BSE-9 (5.6%) of whom did BSE using a correct method and at an appropriate time. Of 140 non-performers, 74 (52.9%) did not know how to do BSE; the remaining women did not do BSE for fear of being found positive for cancer or did not care about it. Those who performed BSE learned it from medical personnel (n = 72, 49.4%), their relatives, and TV, radio, books, journals and pamphlets. Of those who performed BSE, 9 (5.6%) found an abnormal examination; 6 (3.8%) were found positive after further evaluation. The likelihood of performing BSE was not associated with educational level, marital status, age of participant, or how the participant learned about BSE. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that 46.7% of participants did not perform BSE, and that almost all of those who did perform BSE did it incorrectly-and taking into account that a lack of knowledge on how to perform BSE was the main reason why most non-performers did not examine themselves-establishing educational programmes to teach women at risk may help in the early diagnosis of breast cancer.",M2

During the period between July 10th to August 25th 2006, through five big hospitals in Dakar, we interviewed 300 patients coming from a medical or surgical consultation. For every patient we studied the social and demographic characteristics, the antecedents and arguments about the knowledge and practice of BSE. We found, in majority, a young population (the average age was 34 years), no sent to school (26.7%), without any financial income (58.7%), with a brief knowledge about BSE (42.7%) and a regular practice of BSE (29%). The information about BSE originated essentially from educational television (52.9%). This knowledge and practice were significantly influenced by the study level (p = 0.000) and the level of financial income (p = 0.02). Among these who presented certain factors of breast cancer risk, the knowledge and the practice of the BSE were however low.

This research was conducted as a descriptive, correlational study in an area covered by three neighborhood primary health care clinics in Bornova, Izmir. The data were collected between April and November 2006 from 382 women over 40 years of age who were selected using a stratified random sampling method and a descriptive information form, Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Body Cathexis Scale (BCS) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The breast cancer screening methods used by women participating in the research were, respectively, mammography (34%), clinical breast examination (14.1%), breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) (59.4%). The reasons why women did not do breast cancer screening methods were determined to be: not having any symptoms, neglect, not sensing the need, and not knowing how BSE is done. In the examination of the women's CHBMS subscale score means and RSES, BCS and BHS score mean a statistically significant relationships were determined between Benefits-BSE, Barriers-BSE, Confidence, Health motivation, Benefits-mammography and barriers-mammography subscale score means and RSES, BCS and BHS mean scores (p&lt;0.01).

19445434,"A brief intervention designed to increase breast cancer self-screening.PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of an intervention designed to increase appropriate use of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). METHODS: Two-armed randomized clinical trial of cancer-control interventions in women that compared a BSE intervention program to a dietary intervention, which served as the control group. The study was conducted at a large health maintenance organization in Portland, Oregon. Participants were 616 female members of the health maintenance organization who were aged 40 to 70 years. The intervention consisted of a 30- to 45-minute individual counseling session that featured BSE instruction, training and practice with silicone models, identification of barriers to BSE, and problem-solving. This intervention was followed by two brief follow-up telephone calls. The study outcome measure was self-reported BSE practice, which included duration, frequency, and specific elements of exam. RESULTS: The study had a 90% response rate. At the 1-year follow-up, chi2 analyses showed that significantly more individuals in the BSE intervention (59%) reported adequate BSE performance compared with those in the control group (12.2%; p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: This brief intervention was successful in encouraging women to perform adequate BSEs. Although the role of the BSE in patient care remains controversial, these results show that even brief intervention programs can be effective at encouraging self-screening for cancer. This intervention could easily be modified to target other screening practices (e.g., skin or testicular cancer screening) that are associated with reduced cancer morbidity and mortality.",M2

DESIGN: A time-series nonequivalent control group design was used. SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENT: Twenty-four couples in each of 2 groups completed a preintervention test and were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months later for their knowledge of breast cancer and BSE, spousal encouragement for BSE, perceived confidence in BSE methods, change in BSE stage, and perceived benefits and barriers to BSE. The intervention involved husbands as well as women, and consisted of lectures on breast cancer and BSE, demonstrations and practice with models while being videotaped, and feedback. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the control and experimental groups for all variables. Change of BSE stage in experimental group showed significantly advancement over time. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention program was effective in promoting regular BSE practice and in enhancing confidence in BSE. The intervention also raised awareness among husbands of the importance of breast health for their wives. Educational interventions for breast cancer prevention should be specified to an individual's stage of BSE.",M2
19296027,"Breast cancer knowledge and screening practices: a survey of 1,000 Asian women.INTRODUCTION: The incidence of breast cancer in Asia is rapidly rising. Knowledge and perception often influence attendance at screening programmes. However, there has not been any survey to assess the level of knowledge of breast cancer in an Asian population. Singapore has a multiracial population and is the only Asian country with a national screening programme. We conducted a survey on 1,000 women to assess their level of knowledge and screening practices. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was used, where one point was given for a correct answer and zero for an incorrect /  not sure  response. The maximum knowledge score was 19. The women were also surveyed for their screening practices. Points were not assigned to questions on practice. RESULTS: The response rate was 100 percent. The mean score was 11.4 and the median was 12 (range 0-19). The scores were high for general knowledge and disease progression, but poor for risk factors, screening, symptoms and treatment. Several myths and misconceptions were prevalent. Only 53 percent did regular breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), while 57 percent of women aged 40 years and above had gone for a screening mammogram. Increasing age, Malay race, lower educational level, lower socioeconomic class and not knowing anyone with breast cancer were significant independent predictors of poor knowledge. Higher educational level and knowledge scores were significant independent predictors of BSE practice and screening mammogram attendance. CONCLUSION: Knowledge affects practice. Public education is required to correct misconceptions and focus on women with poor knowledge. This would help to improve screening attendance rates.",M2
19258827,"A different approach to breast self-examination education: daughters educating mothers creates positive results in Turkey.Breast cancer is a common cancer among women, and early detection is important for breast cancer mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of daughters teaching their mothers about breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and its health beliefs. In the study's first stage, 168 university students were trained by the School of Health students about BSE through group training methods. Then, these trained university students were asked to train their mothers about BSE. Data were collected before the training and then again after the training (1 month later). The study instruments included questionnaire forms and the Champion Health Belief Model Scale. The results were analyzed using paired- and unpaired-sample t test, analysis of variance, bivariate correlation analysis, and stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results show that women's knowledge level increased 2-fold after training, and the knowledge level difference between pretraining and post-training was significant (P = .000). The mothers' background information (hear-read) and BSE practice (P = .006 and .006, respectively) before the training process were found to be significant predictors of sociodemographic and other variables influencing the mothers' knowledge levels. The training increased the perceived benefit (P = .032) and confidence (P = .000) significantly. It was found that there was a negative but significant correlation between perceived barriers and BSE knowledge after the education (P = .019). It was found that mothers' knowledge level about BSE was higher after the education. Furthermore, perceived barriers decreased while other subscales increased. Education from daughter to mother can be used as a BSE training approach to increase women's knowledge about BSE.",M2
19253511,"Effects of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) program for detection early stage of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common site-specific cancer in women and is the leading cause of death from cancer disease, patients were needed to diagnose at an early stage of disease for better prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of breast self-examination (BSE) training program of Provincial Public Health Office in Singburi. MATERIAL AND METHOD: After the BSE program in Singburi Province was started in July 2005, the female breast cancer patients at Singburi Hospital during the period of two and a half years after BSE training program were recruited into the study. All samples completed questionnaires and thorough physical examination. The questionnaires included sociodemographic data, history of village health volunteer consultation about breast self-examination and the practice themselves of breast self-examination. The data from medical records, including the staging of the disease were collected. The data of female breast cancer patients at the same hospital during the period of two and a halfyears before the implement of BSE program were used to compare the results. RESULTS: There were 43 patients offemale breast cancer before and 39 patients after BSE training program recruited into the study. The demographics data in both groups were not difference. The majorities ofpatients were wageworker low family income, married and had only elementary education level. There was no previous history of BSE practice in both groups before the BSE training program started. Before BSE training program, the early stage offemale breast cancer disease was diagnosed in 81.4% but after BSE training program, it was increasing to 89.7%. Almost patients found their breast masses by themselves. There were 2 patients whom their breast mass were found by village health volunteers consultation and 10 patients detected their breast mass by themselves after received information about breast self-examination from primary health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of early stage female breast cancer disease in this study was increasingly after BSE training program. This program may help to promote the detection of early stage offemale breast cancer. The further evaluation of this program is needed.",M2
19230770,"Comparison of two different educational methods on teachers' knowledge, beliefs and behaviors regarding breast cancer screening.AIM: This research has been carried out to compare the effects of different educational initiatives on the beliefs and behaviors related to the practice of early diagnosis of breast cancer. Ninety-three female primary school teachers who were working in Ordu during the time of the research agreed to join the research; 51 of them comprised the model group and 42 the video group. METHODS: The teachers both in video and model groups were equaled from the point of view of their age, having had previous breast problems, a history of breast cancer in the family, or knowing how to do breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>). Questionnaires were used to collect data. These included the Champion's Health Belief Model Scales of Breast Cancer Screening and the control list regarding how to do BSE. The collected data were evaluated by computer using the following tests: descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Independent Samples t-test, Paired t-test, and McNemar test. RESULTS: Following the education given to the video group, susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy of BSE, and perceived benefits of mammography increased relative to prior to education. In addition the teachers in the video group also improved in their knowledge of BSE. Regarding the education given to the model group, susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy of BSE, and perceived benefits of mammography increased relative to before the education. The teachers in the model group also improved in their knowledge and ability to perform BSE. As a result, it was determined that there is no difference between the beliefs of both groups. CONCLUSION: This study showed that both video and model methods of education were effective in changing health beliefs regarding breast cancer screening and on the same level increasing knowledge and practice of BSE.",M2
19136330,"Knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of nursing and midwifery students regarding breast self-examination in Turkey.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of nursing and midwifery students regarding breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional. SETTING: Aydin School of Health at Adnan Menderes University in Aydin, Turkey. SAMPLE: 244 female students of nursing and midwifery. METHODS: Data were collected with a questionnaire. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: BSE-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. FINDINGS: More than half of the study participants stated they had sufficient information about BSE from varied sources, primarily from school curricula. The students were knowledgeable about who should perform BSE and its recommended frequency; however, their knowledge of BSE techniques was limited. First-year students had negative attitudes about BSE but became more positive as they progressed in their education. Half of the study sample stated they performed BSE at recommended times and intervals, but only one-fifth used recommended BSE positions and techniques. The main reasons for not performing BSE included not knowing how to perform it (57%), not having any history of problems in the breast (39%), and forgetfulness (18%). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that nursing and midwifery education has a positive effect on students' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding BSE. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The findings suggest that nursing and midwifery students should be thoroughly prepared to perform BSE on themselves so they can educate other women about this important preventive procedure.",M2
19130329,"Uptake of breast cancer screening measures among immigrant and Swiss women in Switzerland.BACKGROUND: Early detection of breast cancer plays a crucial role in survival, and in most developed countries immigrant women present for treatment at a later stage of the disease. Compared to the indigenous population, immigrant women have a lower uptake of breast cancer prevention services. The situation for immigrant women in Switzerland is compounded by the fact that all women living in Switzerland are at major risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetime. QUESTION UNDER STUDY: Our study aimed to detect disparities in uptake of preventive methods such as mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE) and breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) among women from the four major immigrant groups Italy, Spain, former Yugoslavia and Portugal, compared to the native population in Switzerland. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of data from the 2002 Swiss Health Survey, a nationwide cross-sectional telephone survey. The self-reported questionnaires addressed immigrant and Swiss women of age 20 and over (n = 9,790). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic characteristics of the sample. The dichotomous variables of interest, mammography, CBE and BSE were adjusted for nationality and further sociodemographic factors using logistic regression, with Swiss women serving as the comparison group. RESULTS: Main predictors for mammography uptake were higher income and older age. For the use of CBE, lower age, higher income and nationality were the strongest predictors. Women from former Yugoslavia (OR = 2.6) and Portugal (OR = 2.8) more frequently stated that they did not receive CBE compared to Swiss females (p = .011). BSE is linked to a higher socioprofessional status and to nationality. Women from Italy (OR = 1.62) and former Yugoslavia (OR = 2.6) perform BSE significantly less often than Swiss women (p = .0001). CONCLUSION: Differences exist in the use of mammography, CBE and BSE among the four major foreign nationality groups living in Switzerland compared to Swiss nationals. Immigrant and low-income women might draw benefit from a systematic and culturally adapted breast cancer screening programme to overcome disparities in access to screening.",M2
19054002,"Breast health of US women religious (nuns).Breast cancer is a major health problem and concern of women religious in the USA. Although they have been identified as a high-risk population, only a limited number of breast health studies have been conducted. The purpose of this study was to explore breast-related health practices (breast self-examination [<e>BSE</e>], clinical breast examination [CBE], and mammography) of women religious residing in the United States. A survey design was used to collect a national sample. The probability sample consisted of 1,615 women religious between the ages of 24 and 99 (mean age = 64.5). Nearly 71% of the respondents reported performing BSE; 22.7% monthly. Sixty-nine percent of participants reported having a mammogram within the past year. Nearly 70% of the respondents reported having had a CBE within the past year. Several factors for not performing BSE or having mammogram are described by this population. Findings suggest a need for increase engagement by women religious in breast-related health practices.",M2
19037556,"Reliability and validity of Champion's Health Belief Model Scale for breast cancer screening among Malaysian women.INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Malaysian women, and the use of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography remain low in Malaysia. Therefore, there is a need to develop a valid and reliable tool to measure the beliefs that influence breast cancer screening practices. The Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) is a valid and reliable tool to measure beliefs about breast cancer and screening methods in the Western culture. The purpose of this study was to translate the use of CHBMS into the Malaysian context and validate the scale among Malaysian women. METHODS: A random sample of 425 women teachers was taken from 24 secondary schools in Selangor state, Malaysia. The CHBMS was translated into the Malay language, validated by an expert's panel, back translated, and pretested. Analyses included descriptive statistics of all the study variables, reliability estimates, and construct validity using factor analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 37.2 (standard deviation 7.1) years. Factor analysis yielded ten factors for BSE with eigenvalue greater than 1 (four factors more than the original): confidence 1 (ability to differentiate normal and abnormal changes in the breasts), barriers to BSE, susceptibility for breast cancer, benefits of BSE, health motivation 1 (general health), seriousness 1 (fear of breast cancer), confidence 2 (ability to detect size of lumps), seriousness 2 (fear of long-term effects of breast cancer), health motivation 2 (preventive health practice), and confidence 3 (ability to perform BSE correctly). For CBE and mammography scales, seven factors each were identified. Factors for CBE scale include susceptibility, health motivation 1, benefits of CBE, seriousness 1, barriers of CBE, seriousness 2 and health motivation 2. For mammography the scale includes benefits of mammography, susceptibility, health motivation 1, seriousness 1, barriers to mammography seriousness 2 and health motivation 2. Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients ranged from 0.774 to 0.939 for the subscales. CONCLUSION: The translated version of the CHBMS was found to be a valid and reliable tool for use with Malaysian women. It can be used easily to evaluate the health beliefs about breast cancer, BSE, CBE and mammography and for planning interventions. For greater applicability, it is recommended that this tool be tested among ethnically diverse populations.",M2
19010096,"Relationship of body image to breast and skin self-examination intentions and behaviors.Breast self-examinations (<e>BSE</e>) and skin self-examinations (SSE) represent cost-effective and time-efficient approaches to cancer detection. Given their utility, it is important to determine who is likely to perform these behaviors regularly and why. Because BSE and SSE require close examination of one's body, women who are less satisfied and less comfortable with their bodies may perform these behaviors less often. This study sought to determine if a relationship exists between body image and BSE and SSE behaviors and intentions. Ninety-three women completed measures assessing body image, past performance of and future intentions to perform BSE and SSE. Results indicated that body image was related to past performance of SSE. Having greater body-areas satisfaction and more favorable global evaluations of appearance were related to having performed SSE more frequently in the past year. Future research should further examine this relationship utilizing longitudinal designs and more diverse populations.",M2
18810644,"Breast self-examination in long-term breast cancer survivors.INTRODUCTION: For many breast cancer survivors, continued surveillance will be necessary to increase the possibility of finding a new diagnosis in an early stage. One such surveillance approach, breast self-examination, has not been studied specifically in breast cancer survivors. The current study was designed to assess the practice of <e>BSE</e> in a sample of long-term breast cancer survivors, and to examine the personal, emotional, cognitive, and health-care provider factors that may contribute to its performance. METHODS: Three hundred forty-five breast cancer survivors (34% response rate, 345/1,001) diagnosed with in situ-stage II breast cancer between 1997-2004 at a community hospital provided answers to a mailed, self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of respondents reported that they had performed a BSE in the last 30-days. Forty percent reported performing BSE once/month, 39% more than once/month, and 21% less than once/month since their diagnosis. Most of the women (90%) reported that a doctor or nurse told them to perform a BSE once/month since their diagnosis, although only 69% had actually been shown how to perform a BSE. Consistently, the perception of increased barriers to BSE performance was associated with performance of BSE less than once/month (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6; OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.8, 0.9). In addition, depending on the model, age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.2), perceived effectiveness of cancer treatments (OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.5, 0.9), and perceived benefits of BSE (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.7, 0.9) also was associated with differences in BSE performance. CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that breast cancer survivors between 4 and 11 years from diagnosis practice BSE, although their perception of the barriers to conducting BSE influences the frequency of this behavior. Further examination is needed to understand why some survivors perceive greater barriers to BSE performance than others. Also needed is a prospective examination of BSE performance using behavioral measures in relation to self-report. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Increased attention should be paid to this particular screening behavior performed by a majority of breast cancer survivors by both researchers and health-care providers alike. Whether survivors perform the behavior correctly and the impact it has on their emotional and cognitive well-being should be further explored.",M2
18714711,"The role of behavioral, normative and control beliefs in breast self-examination.CONTEXT: A limited number of studies have been conducted examining the role of beliefs in the prediction of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) behavior in Australian women, particularly women under 50 years of age for which it is the primary method of early detection of breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The present research investigated the differences in behavioral, normative and control beliefs between BSE performers and non-performers, within a theory of planned behavior framework, to assist in the development of specific education programs aimed at increasing BSE amongst this demographic group. METHOD: Two hundred and fifty-three women enrolled in an undergraduate psychology course completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs regarding BSE. One month later, these women reported their BSE behavior during the previous month. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify belief-based differences between BSE performers and non-performers. RESULTS: Underlying behavioral and control, but not normative, beliefs about BSE distinguished between BSE performers and non-performers. Performers were more likely than non-performers to believe that engaging in BSE would be associated with identifying a lump or breast change sooner and detecting a breast cancer earlier in its course. Non-performers were more likely to perceive factors such as forgetting to perform the behavior, lack of time, lack of knowledge about how to perform the behavior, laziness, and a lack of confidence in their ability to identify lumps and breast changes as factors preventing their control over the performance of BSE. CONCLUSIONS: The belief-based differences between BSE performers and non-performers found in this study can be used to inform health promotion strategies aimed at increasing BSE behavior in women less than 50 years of age.",M2
18712963,"Knowledge and behavior regarding breast cancer screening among female teachers in Selangor, Malaysia.A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the knowledge and practices of 425 female secondary school teachers from 20 selected secondary schools in Selangor, Malaysia on breast cancer screening (BCS). A self-administered, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. This study showed moderate to low knowledge on breast cancer (BC) and BCS among teachers. Only 19%, 25% and 13.6% eligible women performed breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography respectively, on a regular basis. Level of breast cancer knowledge was significantly associated with BSE (p&lt;0.001). Having heard/ read about BCS, and regular visit with a physician were associated with BCS behaviors (P&lt;0.05). There was no association between BCS behaviors (P&gt;0.05) and age, family history of breast cancer, marital status or having health insurance. Efforts are needed to increase knowledge and remove misconceptions about breast cancer and screening practices among Malaysian women.",M2
18620559,"Temporal trends in breast cancer presentation in the third world.BACKGROUND: Third world breast cancer is characterized by late presentation, occurrence at relatively young ages and dismal mortality. This poor outcome has encouraged patients to patronize quacks and alternative healers. Public control measures have targeted mainly public education and provision of screening facilities. Recent reports from the developed world indicate a high association with obesity, tobacco and alcohol, habits which though not currently very popular in the third world are nevertheless increasingly accepted. METHODS: A prospective study initiated in 1985 for all breast cancer patients attending 4 hospitals located in the Eastern Nigeria heartland where the author practiced. On attendance to hospital detailed epidemiological data including social habits were collected from patients. RESULTS: Reports from our first series [1987-97] showed some improvement in terms of earlier presentation compared to a historical control of earlier reports from the sub-region. Reports from the present study showed that this improvement has not been maintained probably as a result of diversion of public health campaign finances to HIV/AIDS. However there is an increasing mean age of presentation due to a higher representation of above 70 years age group and a significant reduction in parity. Alcohol intake and smoking have remained at low levels among the patients. CONCLUSION: There is need to take another look at cancer public health campaign mechanisms in the face of competing demands from HIV. Public control measures should include among others teaching of Breast Self Examination [<e>BSE</e>] to patients, Clinical Breast Examination [CBE] to health workers and opportunistic CBE to all patients. Strenuous efforts should be made to break the vicious cycle of late presentation, poor treatment outcome and reluctance of patients to present to health facilities because of poor outcome.",M2
18616506,"Prospective analysis of the long-term effect of teaching breast self-examination and breast awareness.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the industrialized world and a leading cause of death. Breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) is one of the methods for an early detection of breast cancer. In the present study the effectiveness of a campaign promoting BSE and breast awareness was analysed. Seminars were conducted in 2003 in Lower Saxony, Germany by a female gynaecologist and a social pedagogue and included a lecture, an individual training in BSE in a separate room and a talk about the importance of regular BSEs. Questionnaires were handed out immediately after the seminar and were sent by post 1 year later. Attendance of the seminar resulted in a significantly higher percentage of monthly BSEs (21.4% before vs. 61.9% after the teaching). Furthermore, 92.1% of the women who did not perform a monthly BSE stated that at least they examined their breasts more frequently after attending the seminar. The data demonstrate that the seminars in BSE had profound effects on the compliance of women in carrying out BSE regularly and correctly, without influence of age or education.",M2
18604121,"Validating breast self examination as screening modalities for breast cancer in eastern region of Nepal: a population based study.Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death in many developed countries amongst middle-aged women and is becoming common in developing countries as well. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of Breast Self Examination (<e>BSE</e>) against examination conducted by the trained health personnel. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive evaluative study was conducted among women aged 15 to 60 years undertaken in urban and rural areas. It was a population-based study and non-probability sampling method was used for data collection. Respondents conducted Breast Self Examination on their own, and then investigators did clinical examination of breasts of the respondents to verify their findings. RESULTS: Mean age of the respondents was 34.54 +/- 9.12 years. Nearly half (44.8%) of the respondents were illiterate. On comparison of each variable of breast self- examination with the physical examination of breast, it was observed that size of the breasts and lump found in the breast had significant relation to performance during examination (P&lt;0.1). The result of Kappa test showed 68% agreement between findings of examinations done by the experts and respondents. CONCLUSION: Breast Self Examination can be used as an important tool for primary prevention of breast cancer in Nepal, where sophisticated method like screening mammography for general public cannot afford.",M2
18554093,"Factors associated with breast cancer prevention communication between mothers and daughters.OBJECTIVE: Mother-daughter communication may be a potential pathway between family history and cancer prevention behavior. We examined the degree to which mothers reported providing advice on breast cancer prevention to their daughters, the content of such advice, and correlates of providing such advice. METHODS: Data were collected via a mailed questionnaire to 1773 women from 355 families in the Minnesota Breast Cancer Family Study. Women were asked whether or not they had provided advice to their daughters on what they should do to prevent breast cancer. An additional open-ended question asked them to describe the types of advice they had provided. RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-six (55%) of the women reported providing breast cancer prevention advice to their daughters. The most frequent types of advice were to have a mammogram (51%), perform breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) (39%), have a clinical breast examination (CBE) (30%), and maintain a healthy lifestyle (21%). From multivariate logistic regression, older age (p &lt; 0.001), having a personal history of breast cancer (p &lt; 0.001), higher degree of breast cancer worry/concern (p &lt; 0.001), engaging in a higher number of health-promoting behaviors (p &lt; 0.001), and ever performing a BSE (p = 0.04) were factors independently associated with the provision of advice. Analyses accounting for sample nonindependence did not change our results. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer prevention behaviors were associated with providing advice. By better understanding the pathways through which breast cancer family history is associated with screening mammography and other prevention behaviors, researchers can develop more effective, tailored prevention interventions at the family level.",M2
18467291,"Supporting breast self-examination in female childhood cancer survivors: a secondary analysis of a behavioral intervention.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify intervention targets that will increase the frequency of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) in female survivors of childhood cancer. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of longitudinal clinical trial data. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in a children's research hospital. SAMPLE: 149 female survivors (aged 12-18 years) a median of 11 years after diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma (59%) or solid tumor (41%). METHODS: Paired t tests, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: BSE frequency, health risk perceptions, motivation, and fears or worries. FINDINGS: Baseline BSE frequency was the strongest influence on follow-up BSE. Baseline and follow-up age and school grade influenced follow-up BSE. Other influential variables included motivation for behavior change, motivation to commit to health promotion, concern about appearance, and an interaction between the intervention and mother's highest grade level. When baseline BSE frequency and school grade were statistically controlled, diagnosis and significant interactions between grade level and the follow-up measures of the mother's education, general fears about cancer, fears about cancer returning, and perceptions of susceptibility to late treatment effects were significant influences on BSE after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors least likely to perform BSE are fearful about cancer and are not motivated to change health behaviors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should explore survivors' fears about cancer and late treatment effects to address misconceptions, use modeling techniques with return demonstrations to ensure competency in BSE, and tailor risk information to each survivor's background (socio-economic status, age, development) and cognitive (disease and treatment knowledge, risks) and affective (fears) characteristics to increase BSE motivation.",M2
18440273,"The problems encountered by midwives during breast self-examination training.The second leading cause of cancer death in Turkey, breast cancer accounts for 24% of female cancers, with a crude incidence rate of 7.2 per 100,000 women in 1999. It was determined that breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) is carried out effectively if it is taught by a physician or a midwife/nurse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive study was performed in 16 health centers found in the city center of Samsun between 01.09.2006 and 30.12.2006. A total of 124 midwives work in the health centers found in the city center of Samsun. It tried to cover the total population rather than sampling part of it. However, 11 midwives, where there was error detected in their data coding paper, and who did not accept to join the study, were excluded from the study. A total of 103 midwives (response rate=83.06%) were included in the study group. The data were collected using a questionnaire form and a problem definition list prepared according to the literature. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: While 90.3% of the midwives stated that they performed BSE, it was seen that 82.6% of the midwives performed BSE irregularly. While 97.1% of the midwives considered BSE as important, 78.6% of them stated that they had had on-the-job training about BSE. About 82.5% of the midwives stated that they educated women about BSE and 75.7% of them said that they did not feel as sufficient themselves for BSE training. The midwives stated that the most frequent problems encountered were that the women were not willing to apply BSE (43.7%), the women were not able to distinguish the masses from normal breast tissue (48.5%), the women did not feel confident in detecting the masses (49.5%) and the women were not willing to think about cancer (41.7%). CONCLUSION: This study shows that multiple reasons are affecting women's BSE practices, which midwives should address when delivering their training sessions.",M2
18419631,"Awareness of breast and cervical cancer risk factors and screening behaviours among nurses in rural region of Turkey.Breast and cervical cancer are the most common causes of cancer mortality among women worldwide, but actually they are largely preventable diseases. There is limited data on breast and cervical cancer knowledge, screening practices and attitudes of nurses in Turkey. A self-administered questionnaire was used to investigate the knowledge and attitude of nurses on risk factors of the breast and cervical cancer as well as screening programmes such as breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), clinical breast examination, mammography (MMG) and papanicolaou (pap) smear test. In total, 125 out of 160 nurses participated in the study (overall response rate was 80.6%). The risk factors and symptoms of breast cancer was generally well known, except for early menarche (23.2%) and late menopause (28.8%). For cervical cancer, the correct risk factors mostly indicated by the nurses were early age at first sexual intercourse (56%), smoking (76%), multiple sexual partners (71.2%). As for screening methods, it was believed that BSE was a beneficial method to identify the early breast changes (84.8%) and MMG was able to detect the cancer without a palpable mass (57.6%). Little was known about the fact that women should begin cervical cancer screening approximately 3 years after the onset of sexual intercourse (23.2%) and if repeated pap smear test were normal, it could be done every 2-3 years. Most of the nurses considered that MMG decreases the mortality in breast cancer (65.6%) and also believed that pap smear test decreases the mortality in cervical cancer (75.2%). Despite high level of knowledge of breast cancer risk factors, symptoms and screening methods, inadequate knowledge of cervical cancer screening method were found among nurses.",M2
18402419,"Knowledge of breast self-examination in women in Sierra Leone.This research is a follow up of a Breast Week which was organized in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The specific objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the knowledge and teachings given to the women who participated in this project. A quantitative approach with an exploratory descriptive design was adopted and an observational checklist guided the data collection process. A sample size of 120 women (10%) who participated in the Breast Week was obtained through systematic sampling. During the Breast Week women were taught how to examine their breasts using breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) to detect abnormalities of the breasts. This study was undertaken one year later by the researcher to ascertain whether the information on breast self-examination provided during the Breast Week was being utilised and whether what was taught was being put into use. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. Reliability and validity were ensured through the use of a structured observational checklist and a pilot study was undertaken. The observations were all observed and recorded by the same researcher. The majority of the 120 women (91.7%) stated that they had never practiced BSE before the Breast Week. After receiving health education on BSE, 95% were able to demonstrate an effective method of undertaking BSE. It is thus recommended that every opportunity should be utilized in health care settings to teach BSE and to reinforce the practice, especially in poverty stricken countries where other forms of screening methods are unavailable.",M2
18364100,"Reproductive health practices among Indian, Indo-Canadian, Canadian East Asian, and Euro-Canadian women: the role of acculturation.OBJECTIVE: Lower rates of cervical cancer screening in Indian women have been consistently reported, and this has been attributed to cultural barriers. In Canada, the fastest-growing and largest immigrant groups are South Asian and East Asian. Since traditional values are largely retained in Indo-Canadian immigrants and their children, identifying reproductive health behaviours among these ethnic minority groups is important. Our goal was to compare reproductive health knowledge and behaviours of Indian women living in India and in Canada, East Asian women in Canada, and Euro-Canadian women. We also explored the level of acculturation in the two immigrant groups in order to understand the extent to which affiliation with Western culture may improve reproductive health knowledge. METHODS: We recruited 663 women of reproductive age from India and from a Canadian university for assessment. These women completed the Health Beliefs Questionnaire, which measures reproductive health behaviours and knowledge, and the Vancouver Index of Acculturation, which measures the level of mainstream and heritage acculturation. RESULTS: Euro-Canadian women were most likely to have ever had a Papanicolaou (Pap) test and to perform breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). There was no difference between the two Indian groups in the proportion who had ever had a Pap test, but Indo-Canadian women were more likely to have performed BSE. All women showed knowledge of reproductive health, but the three Canadian groups consistently had more accurate knowledge than the Indian group. Among the two immigrant groups, the level of acculturation was associated with reproductive health knowledge. CONCLUSION: Canadian women show reproductive health behaviours and knowledge that is superior to Indian women. Moving to a western culture did not influence Indian women's Pap testing behaviour; however, the fact that the reproductive health knowledge of Indian women who moved to Canada was better than that of women in India suggests that there may be a knowledge-behaviour desynchrony in this group of women. Efforts targeted at ethnic minority groups that aim to improve reproductive health knowledge and behaviours are greatly needed.",M2

This descriptive study assessed the knowledge of breast self-exams (<e>BSEs</e>) via pre-tests and post-tests in older African-American women (&gt; 60) at an initial session (Time 1), and then again at a follow-up session (Time 2) two months later. A sample of 57 older African-American women living in inner city apartment buildings participated in the study. There were significant differences between pre-test Time 1 and post-test Time 1 (p = .000) and pre-test Time 2 and post-test Time 2 (p = .000). In addition, a significant difference was detected between pre-test Time 1 and pre-test Time 2 (p = .039). Additionally, a content analysis revealed what factors would influence older African-American women to continue to perform BSEs in the future. Providing BSE education to older African-American women may be useful in decreasing mortality rates for breast cancer.",M2

This descriptive study was conducted in various health centers located in Erzurum, Turkey. The sample consisted of 268 female health workers (physicians, n=51; nurses, n=169; and midwives, n=48). Data were collected by using a self-administered questionnaire and the Turkish version of Champion's Health Belief Model Scales (CHBMS). The mean age of participants was 31.31 (S.D.=6.89), and 49.9% of them were married. It was found that only 21.9% of the female health workers performed breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) regularly, and 12.5% of them had a mammogram. Physicians' health motivation and BSE self-efficacy perceptions were higher than the nurses and midwives. Susceptibility, health motivation to BSE, BSE benefits, BSE self-efficacy perceptions of female health workers who performed BSE were significantly higher than those who did not, and a result indicating that positive health beliefs are effective in stimulating performance of BSE of female health workers. Among the variables related with mammography, only susceptibility perceptions of female health workers who had a mammogram was significantly higher than those who had not had a mammogram.",M2
18260740,"Socioeconomic factors association with knowledge and practice of breast self-examination among Iranian women.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women and is one of the most frequent cancers among Iranian women. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer diminishes a women's chance of survival. Breast self- examination (<e>BSE</e>) may be effective in early detection. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between Iranian women's socioeconomic status and their knowledge and practice of BSE. METHODS: Data were from a hospital-based case-control study among women diagnosed with breast cancer. Control subjects were matched to patients on age. 303 breast cancer patients and 303 control women were interviewed. Socioeconomic status and information including knowledge and practices of breast self examination and clinical breast examination were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age of cases and controls was 48.2 +/- 9.8 and 50.2 +/- 11.1 (range 24-84 years), respectively. The study revealed that there were significant relationships between education level and knowledge and practices of breast self examination in both cases and controls, increase in usage being observed with the level of education (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the knowledge and practices of women toward breast cancer early detection are inadequate in women with a lower level of education. Mass media cancer education should promote widespread access to information about early detection behavior.",M2
18260715,"Assessing the efficacy of a peer education model in teaching breast self-examination to university students.This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer education model in teaching breast self-examination to a late adolescence female student group attending the second class of Buca Educational Faculty of Dokuz Eylül University (DEU). A total of 15 volunteer students were given the breast self-examination training programme by a researcher and thereby became qualified as peer educators. Each then reached 10 peers and conveyed information on the Breast-Self Examination Programme. The identification forms of the students were filled out by the researcher. Evaluation forms I and II developed by Maurer (1997) for regular <e>BSE</e> practice and skills were used and evaluated with 100 points. The  paired t-test ,  Student's t-test ,  McNemar test , and  Pearson correlation test  were employed to for statistical assessment. According to the evaluation results; while the students's average point of knowledge on BSE was 43.0 +/- 11.7 before training, it became 88.9 +/- 8.15 after a week, and 86.9 +/- 9.69 after four weeks. It was obvious that there was a meaningful difference between those knowledge rates (p&lt;0,05). Similarly while the ratio of systematic practice of BSE among students was 2.6% before training it increased to 66% (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, the average point of the students BSE practice skills became 91.5 +/- 7.25 at four weeks after the training with a significant increase as well (r=0,70). Therefore we conclude that the peer education model is an effective method for teaching breast self examination to students.",M2
18242140,"Factors associated with breast self-examination practices and beliefs in female workers at a Muslim community.The purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to identify knowledge levels and performance frequency of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and to examine variables related to breast cancer screening behaviors in a sample of Turkish women. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 103 Muslim female workers at a hazelnut factory in Ordu city, Turkey, using an adapted version of Champion's revised Health Belief Model Scale. Results showed that 26.2% of the women reported knowledge of BSE and 4.3% reported that they perform BSE. Higher health motivation, higher perceived self-efficacy of BSE, marital status, and familial breast cancer history were significantly associated with BSE performance. Higher levels of health motivation and higher perceived self-efficacy of BSE were also significantly associated with knowledge of BSE.",M2
18040054,"Cancer risk management practices of noncarriers within BRCA1/2 mutation positive families in the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Women from BRCA mutation-positive families who do not carry the family-specific mutation are generally at average cancer risk and therefore do not require intensive risk management. METHODS: Participants were female noncarriers from BRCA mutation-positive families who had responded to 3 yearly follow-up questionnaires and had chosen to either receive or not receive their genetic test result. In the former group, undertaking mammography younger than age 40 years or more than once every 2 years, clinical breast examination (CBE) more than yearly, breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) more than monthly, or any transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) or CA-125 was considered overscreening. Screening behaviors of women who did and did not know their genetic test result were compared. Logistic regression and nonparametric analyses were performed to identify demographic and psychosocial factors (respectively) associated with overscreening. RESULTS: Of 325 eligible women, 116 knew their mutation status and 209 did not. For the first group, proportions overscreening were mammography, 53%; CBE, 10%; BSE, 11%; TVU, 7%; and CA-125, 10%. There were no significant differences in screening behaviors between the groups. In those aware of their mutation status, parous women were more likely to overuse mammography (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 17; P = .03) and women with one or more first-degree relative with ovarian cancer (OC) were more likely to overuse OC screening (TVU: OR = 6.00; 95% CI, 1.0 to 35.1; P = .047, and CA-125: OR = 6.50; 95% CI, 1.49 to 28.4; P = .013). CONCLUSION: The reasons for overuse of screening (particularly mammography) by mutation noncarriers require additional elucidation given the potential for harm.",M2
18024349,"Determining female physicians' and nurses' practices and attitudes toward breast self-examination in Istanbul, Turkey.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine female physicians' and nurses' practices and attitudes toward breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional. SETTING: Two large, bed-capacity university hospitals and 11 smaller, bed-capacity public hospitals. SAMPLE: 201 female nurses and 149 female physicians who work day shift on medical and surgical wards. METHODS: Data were collected on a questionnaire form that was prepared based on information in the literature. The questionnaire had three sections: sociodemographic characteristics, health characteristics, and attitudes and practices related to BSE. Data were analyzed using t tests and chi-square tests. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Attitudes and practices related to BSE, clinical breast examination, and mammography. FINDINGS: Almost all of the female physicians and nurses knew how to conduct BSE but did not prioritize practicing it. CONCLUSIONS: Female physicians and nurses in Istanbul, Turkey, did not take enough care in the proper timing of BSE (i.e., day 5 to day 7 after menstruation with the first day of menstruation being day 1) despite their knowledge about it. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Female physicians and nurses need to improve their knowledge and sensitivity concerning breast cancer and BSE if they are to improve and maintain their own well-being as well as carry out their professional roles.",M2
18024348,"Knowledge and practice of breast cancer screening among Jordanian nurses.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine Jordanian nurses' knowledge of a and proficiency with breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and early detection of breast cancer. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Seven governmental and three private hospitals in the country of Jordan. SAMPLE: 395 female nurses working in different healthcare settings. Their ages ranged from 21-51 years (X= 31); nursing experience ranged from 1-30 years (X= 16). METHODS: Subjects completed a researcher-developed knowledge test consisting of 24 questions derived from the American Cancer Society's guidelines regarding risk factors associated with breast cancer and methods of early detection and from Jordan's breast cancer statistics. Responses to the knowledge test were summed for an overall knowledge score. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Knowledge of breast cancer and early detection and practice of BSE. FINDINGS: Nurses had low mean levels of knowledge about early detection and facts related to breast cancer in Jordan (X= 51%, SD = 19). Although 86% (n = 343) of the nurses reported performing BSE, only 18% (n = 62) reported doing so on a monthly basis. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses had limited levels of knowledge about breast cancer and methods of early detection; few nurses practiced BSE monthly. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Continuing education programs for nurses are urgently needed to improve nurses' knowledge about breast cancer and BSE. Additional studies to examine the impact of other variables on the practice of early-detection methods should be conducted, such as those that determine faculty knowledge and beliefs about early detection, those that assess curriculum content about breast cancer and its early detection, and those that assess other healthcare providers' knowledge and beliefs about early detection. Intervention studies that aim to increase nurses' knowledge of breast cancer and their practice of early-detection methods would be beneficial.",M2
17950665,"The effect of training on the knowledge levels and beliefs regarding breast self-examination on women attending a public education centre.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of subject training on the level of knowledge about breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and breast cancer in women attending a public education centre. This research was structured according to pre-test-post test, one group research design principles. The study involved 91 course attendees at the Erzincan Public Education Centre (73.4%). The average age of study subjects was 21.4+/-5.4. Of the 91 participants in the study, 3.3% (n=3) had a family history of breast cancer and 5.5% (n=5) have had a lump in their breasts. In pre-test questions, the rate of correct answers was between 13.2% and 68.1%. After training, the rate of correct answers increased to between 79.1% and 96.7% and attendees demonstrated an increase in the accuracy of their beliefs about breast cancer (health risk, susceptibility). The perception of self-efficacy, an important variable in the process of behaviour change, is a necessary component of changing and maintaining the practice of BSE. The results of this work and others demonstrate that education administered by nurses can increase positive perceptions about BSE self-efficacy. Education in BSE is easily administered, requires no special tools, could lead to early diagnosis of breast cancer if performed regularly and should be taught to all women aged 20 years and above.",M2
17929748,"Teaching and breast self-examination: an insufficiency of instruction.Client teaching is recognised as an essential component of nursing and midwifery care, and all clinical areas provide opportunities for informal client teaching. This qualitative study aimed to explore registered nurses' professional practices with regard to teaching breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), and to identify factors that influenced their participation or non-participation in teaching about breast health. Participants' views were obtained using individual semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed inductively, that is, without imposing structure from the interview questions. Findings revealed that participants' perspectives of BSE and breast health, the dual symbolism of breasts, and the time constraints of clinical practice, were significant factors that impacted on participants' personal BSE practices and on their level of participation in teaching BSE. The results indicate that that nurses and midwives do not view teaching breast health as part of their role in client interaction, particularly in an acute care setting. Although nursing literature identifies midwives and nurses as ideally placed to promote health promotion activities, the image of BSE as linked to breast cancer, the dominant illness oriented model of care and a task orientated culture in health care facilities do not facilitate this.",M2
17605625,"The effectiveness of training for breast cancer and breast self-examination in women aged 40 and over.BACKGROUND: Training on breast health is required to increase awareness of early detection of breast cancer, especially in countries with limited resources. METHODS: Of the 784 invited women, 462 participated in the study (58.9%). The training included both theoretical and breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) training between preeducation and posteducation tests. Following the theoretical presentation, breast examination training was performed using a breast simulator. The competency of the participants on breast examination was assessed by an evaluation guide. RESULTS: All breast cancer symptoms were stated at significantly higher rates compared to those before education (P &lt; .05). The most commonly stated risk factor in both preeducation and posteducation tests was  no breast-feeding,  with ratios of 15.2% and 56.3%, respectively. Early detection modalities for breast cancer were also stated more often in the posteducation test compared to the preeducation (P &lt; .05). In the preeducation test, only 4.3% to 18.7% of the participant women could state most of the BSE steps. After BSE training, 85% to 92% of the participants were competent in BSE steps. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretical education on breast cancer and BSE training in low-educated women, even illiterate, is highly effective.",M2

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preplanned breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) training on nursing and midwifery students. METHODS: A total of 74 first-year nursing and midwifery students were trained on BSE. Data were collected before and after BSE education by a modified questionnaire. RESULTS: The BSE accuracy of the students was increased after education. Furthermore, positive attitude and behavior of the students toward BSE were improved. The students started to practice BSE with the right techniques and positions at the right time. The main reasons not to perform BSE were the lack of knowledge and motivation prior the education. CONCLUSIONS: BSE training is effective in nursing and midwifery students but should be repeated periodically for better efficacy.",M2
17573306,"Health beliefs related to breast self-examination in a sample of Turkish women.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine health beliefs and sociodemographic and breast cancer-related variables influencing breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) practice. DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional. SETTING: Two vocational training centers in Istanbul, Turkey. SAMPLE: 438 women were selected using a convenience sampling method. Participants had not had breast cancer and were not currently pregnant or breast-feeding. The mean age of participants was 33.51 years (range = 18-67). METHODS: Willing participants were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire and the Turkish version of Champion's Health Belief Model Scale. The sample was categorized into two groups: performers (i.e., women who performed BSE at least occasionally) and non-performers (i.e., women who had never performed BSE). MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Perceived susceptibility to and seriousness of breast cancer, perceived benefits of and barriers to BSE, confidence in the ability to perform BSE, health motivation, and frequency of BSE practice. FINDINGS: Significant differences between performers and non-performers correlated to age, marital status, health insurance, regular gynecologic visits, and education about breast cancer and BSE. The mean scores of perceived benefits and confidence were noticeably higher in performers. Stepwise logistic regression analysis yielded three significant predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: Women who had more confidence in their ability to perform BSE, had health insurance, and were informed about breast cancer were more likely to practice BSE. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Women in Turkey are at great risk for advanced breast cancer and metastatic spread because of their lack of knowledge. Nurses must provide information on breast cancer etiology, risks, prevention, and detection. To promote BSE practice among Turkish women, tailored health education and health promotion programs should be developed based on a specific understanding of women's health beliefs.",M2
17547778,"How do nurses and teachers perform breast self-examination: are they reliable sources of information?BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine and compare knowledge, behavior and attitudes among female nurses and teachers concerning breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). METHODS: Two-hundred and eighty nine women working in Aydin, Turkey (125 nurses and 164 teachers) were included in the study. The data were collected using a questionnaire designed to measure the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of the groups. Analysis involved percentiles, chi2 tests, t tests and factor analysis. RESULTS: The knowledge of nurses about BSE was higher than that of teachers (81.5% versus 45.1%; p &lt; 0.001). BSE practice parameters (i.e. age groups, indications, frequency) were similar (p &gt; 0.05), whereas skills in performing self-examination were higher in nurses (p &lt; 0.001). Fear of having breast cancer is the most frequent reason for performing BSE. Among nurses, the reasons for failure to perform BSE were the absence of prominent breast problems (82%) and forgetting (56.4%). The teachers who did not perform BSE said that the reasons were lack of knowledge on how to perform self-examination (68.9%) and absence of problems (54%). Both groups had unacceptable technical errors in the performance of BSE. CONCLUSION: We conclude that nurses and teachers should be supported with information enabling them to accomplish their roles in the community. To improve BSE practice, it is crucial to coordinate continuous and planned education.",M2

DESIGN: One group pretest/posttest design. SAMPLE AND MEASUREMENTS: Seven hundred and seventy-seven women in Hong Kong completed a self-administered questionnaire before and after a breast health education program from May 2002 to March 2003. RESULTS: About half were aware of breast health and breast diseases (53.7%) and breast screening methods (48.6%) before the intervention. It was found that women who had received instruction on BSE practice, and those who were aware of breast screening methods, breast health, and breast diseases were more likely to have had prior BSE practice. Most indicated their willingness to practice BSE regularly (93.3%) and to pass on the BSE knowledge to their relatives and friends (92%) in the posttest. CONCLUSIONS: The outreach health education program has successfully reached women living in the 18 districts in Hong Kong. It appears to be useful in raising the awareness of breast health and BSE practice among the women, but longer term follow-up is required to ascertain its sustainability.",M2

METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 266 064 women (age of 30 to 64 years) associated with 519 textile factories in Shanghai had been randomly assigned to a BSE group (132 979 women) or a control group (133 085 women) since 1989. Initial instruction in BSE group would include demonstration of proper palpation techniques and was followed by 2 reinforcement sessions during the subsequent 4 years including video shows, BSE instruction sessions and BSE practice under medical supervision. These activities were continued for 5 years. Attendance at all events was recorded. The cohort was followed through July 2000 for development of breast diseases, and the breast cancer cases were followed through 2001 for vital status. Data analysis methods used would include Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank test and Cox modeling. RESULTS: Among women under instruction, 864 breast cancers detected and 133 breast cancer deaths occurred while 896 breast cancers were detected and 130 deaths recorded in the control group. The tumor size (P = 0.07), TNM stage (P = 0.39) and cumulative breast cancer mortality rate (P = 0.72) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, more and smaller fibroadenomas were detected in the instruction group than in the control group (P&lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Intensive instruction in BSE did not seem to have reduced the mortality rate of breast cancer, but more and smaller benign breast lumps could be detected.",M2
17371185,"Breast self-examination: self-reported frequency, quality, and associated outcomes.BACKGROUND: There is little information on the quality of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and associated outcomes. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 27,421 women enrolled in a Pacific Northwest health plan. We linked responses regarding BSE quality from a questionnaire to subsequent screening and diagnostic efforts. RESULTS: A total of 75% of the women performed BSE. We rated BSE quality as adequate in 27%. Women who reported higher BSE duration, frequency, and quality were more likely to have diagnostic mammograms. Participants ultimately diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 300) were significantly less likely to report performing BSE. Tumor size and stage were not associated with BSE behavior. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of women perform BSE, but few do so adequately. We found no evidence for benefit of BSE.

17370697,"Self reported morbidity and awareness regarding common cancers in elderly women.A study based on 198 women above 45 years of age was undertaken using interview methods in a house to house survey, to find the self reported morbidity and awareness regarding common cancers and screening tests. In this study the most commonly reported morbidity was due to reproductive system and related problems. Among reported problems the most common was visual (66.5%) followed by joint pains(58.9%). There was a highly significant relationship between Hypertension, Diabetes and age and also highly significant relationship between education and reported morbidity like low back ache, easy fatiguability, Hypertension and Diabetes. Women in the age group (45-55years) had a significantly better awareness about common cancers. 29.7% women were aware of breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) and 20.6% practicing BSE. It was also found that women belonging to nuclear families were significantly more likely to practice BSE.

17365357,"The effectiveness in utilizing Chinese media to promote breast health among Chinese women.To increase the awareness and practice of breast health guidelines, a media-based education campaign on breast health was launched among immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco. The media campaign included airing two public service announcements (PSAs) on Chinese television and radio stations and publishing the same message in Chinese newspapers during 2000. Seven-hundred-ten face-to-face interviews were conducted with women who were recruited from various settings in the city of San Francisco to evaluate the impact of the campaign. Survey participants were asked to describe the content of the PSAs. Having viewed the PSA was significantly associated with the ability to identify all four guidelines (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.35-2.85), knowing how to perform breast self-exam (<e>BSE</e>; OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.53-3.29), having performed BSE within the past month (OR = 3.12; 95% CI: 2.05-4.74), and having a clinical breast exam (CBE; OR = 2.98; 95% CI: 1.82-4.90) and mammogram (MAM; OR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.16-3.36) in the past year.

17304397,"Am I breast cancer smart? Assessing breast cancer knowledge among health professionals.INTRODUCTION: Health professionals are a direct source of medical information to the public. Hence, it is crucial that their knowledge is accurate and aids in building awareness. Our aim was to ascertain the level of breast cancer knowledge and screening practices among nurses in a general hospital. METHODS: Between January and April 2004, all registered nurses in a general hospital were surveyed by a self-administered questionnaire for their knowledge of breast cancer and screening practices. One point was given for a correct knowledge answer and zero for wrong/ not sure  answer. The maximum knowledge score was 19. RESULTS: There were 716 (79.4 percent) respondents. The median score was 16 (range 2-19). The scores were high for general knowledge and natural disease progression, fair for knowledge of symptoms and treatment, but dropped when it came to knowledge of risk factors and screening. Nurses also held several common misconceptions held by the public. Those who had managed breast cancer patients had higher total scores (15.7). Only 63 percent did regular breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and only 35 percent had gone for a screening mammogram. Chinese nurses who had managed breast cancer patients were more likely to do regular BSE. CONCLUSION: Nurses working in a general hospital had good knowledge of breast cancer progression, average understanding of symptoms and treatment, but lacked knowledge in risk factors and screening. They had low BSE and mammographic screening rates. Experience in managing breast cancer patients improved their knowledge and practices.",M2

A pre and post-test with no control group design was adopted in this study. A convenient sample of 212 Nursing students at the Faculty of Nursing, Alexandria University, who accepted to participate in the study and enrolled in the first academic year, during the first semester (2001-2002) were included in this study. A specially designed, self-administered questionnaire sheet was used and analyzed to determine the level of Nursing students' knowledge and practices related to <e>BSE</e>. According to Nursing students' needs, an educational booklet about BSE was developed and given to them. After 3 months, reassessment of Nursing students' knowledge and practices was carried out using the same questionnaire sheet to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed booklet. The study revealed a general lack of knowledge and practices related to BSE among Nursing students, where poor total score of knowledge and practices was obtained by most of them before distribution of the educational booklet. The study also revealed that the developed educational booklet about BSE had an obvious effect on improving Nursing students' knowledge and practices regarding BSE, where a highly significant difference was found between their knowledge and practices before and after distribution of the educational booklet. So, improving the health behavior, especially BSE, among Nursing students is needed to help them assume their responsibility towards prevention. This should be carried through the use of the currently developed educational booklet about BSE by all Nursing students.",M2

The study design was based on assumptions from the Health Belief Model and Transtheoretical Model that contemplators perceiving benefits as greater than barriers are likely to move to the next stage. Participant couples, with wives having never practiced BSE but with an intention to do so, were drawn from churches. Qualitative research was conducted with focus group methodology including both husbands and wives in the groups. Data transcribed from audiotapes were analyzed to identify common themes. Knowledge of breast cancer and BSE included  perceiving risks of getting breast cancer,   behaviors used to stay healthy and detect breast cancer,  and  skills in BSE ; barriers to BSE included  lack of sensitivity to breast cancer,   fear of getting bad news,   lack of information,  and  shortage of time ; and facilitators of BSE included  making BSE a monthly routine,   continuous systematic interaction from healthcare professionals reaching out to the community,  and  encouragement and help from husbands.  To improve compliance with BSE, women in the contemplation stage need specific and correct knowledge delivered by diverse materials, reminders, and the inclusion of husbands as facilitators.",M2

Data were collected from a total of 430 females who were living in one of the Health Center areas located in Izmir, a city in the west of Turkey. Champion's revised Health Belief Model Scale was translated into Turkish, validated by professional judges, translated back into English, and then tested. Factor analysis yielded 7 factors: susceptibility, seriousness, barrier 1, barrier 2, confidence, benefits, and health motivation. Significant correlations were found between 2 barriers. Therefore, 2 barriers were considered one barrier subscale. All the items on each factor were from the same construct. Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from .58 to .89, and test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from .89 to .99 for the subscales. Women who received low scores on barriers reported greater frequency of BSE practice. Likewise, women having high scores on confidence, benefits, health motivation, susceptibility, and seriousness reported a greater frequency of BSE in the last year. The frequency of BSE practice was higher in high school and university graduates, women with a family history of breast cancer, and women with breast cancer and BSE training. The Turkish version of Champion's Revised Health Belief Model Scale was found to be a valid and reliable tool for use with Turkish women. It could be used to evaluate health beliefs about breast cancer and BSE among Turkish women.",M2

In this study, survey by questionnaire of 492 women of procreative age was conducted. Breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) was conducted by 82.9% of the respondents, out of which 33.7% conducted regular monthly examinations. The demographic variables assumed in this study proved to be statistically significant (P &lt; .05) for younger single women with medical education and living under conditions of higher economic standard. The diagnostic significance attached to BSE was closely connected with the professional background of the respondents and the actual conducting of BSE. An opinion that BSE has diagnostic value was expressed in the group of medical professionals significantly more frequently than in the group of women representing other professions (P = .0000009). Such an opinion was also held significantly more often in the group of women performing BSE than in the group of women who had no such habit (P &lt; .0000001). A majority of women of procreative age perform BSE; however, only a third perform that regularly, every month. Factors determining the conduction of BSE include age, profession, marital status, and standard of living conditions. The diagnostic significance attached to BSE is closely connected with the professional background of the respondents and actual conducting of BSE. Breast self-examination has not been satisfactorily popularized among Polish women. Greater involvement in educational activities of medical personnel may improve the present situation.",M2

METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out aiming to identify factors potentially associated to BSE in a sample of 2,073 women. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire of age, education level, origin, parity, civil status, income and breastfeeding antecedents of the women. RESULTS: 75% of women knew about BSE and 51% practiced it. A multivariate analysis yielded the following odds ratios: BSE knowledge was 4.2 times higher among housewives than women working away from home; 2.1 times higher among those aged 30 years or older; 2.1 times higher in those with 5 years or more of schooling, 1.98 times higher among those living in the Greater Goiânia Region, 1.4 times higher among those with 2 children or more, and 1.68 times higher among those with an income above 2 minimum wages. In relation to BSE practice, it was 1.7 times more frequent among housewives and among those 30 year or older, 1.8 times more frequent among those with more years of schooling and 1.2 more frequent among women with an income above 2 minimum wages. CONCLUSION: The majority of women knew about BSE, and half of them, practiced it. Less knowledge and less frequent practice of BSE was more often detected in poorer women, those with less health information and awareness about the usefulness of this method for early breast cancer detection.",M2

Knowledge, attitudes and practices of breast self examination among women in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices of women in Qassim region regarding breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>), and also to explore their level of knowledge regarding breast cancer. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey during the period from May to June 2005, among Saudi female patients attending the Primary Health Care Centers of Qassim region. A total of 300 females, 20-70 years of age, were interviewed in 10 randomly selected primary health care centers. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 36.2 +/- 10.2 years, and 70.7% of them were literate. Regarding the knowledge of risk factors, 76% of the respondents had 3 or more correct answers out of the total 7 questions. Twenty-six percent of the respondents did not know the presenting symptom of breast cancer. Whereas, 69.7% of the participants had never heard of BSE. The participants had a positive attitude towards learning BSE. Of the total respondents, 18.7% reported that they practice BSE, majority (57%) of whom had started performing it within the previous year. However, 74% of the respondents did not have access to breast health information. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the level of awareness of the females of Qassim region regarding breast cancer and BSE is not adequate and a health education program for this subject should be introduced in the region.",M2
17042125,"Evidence against breast self examination is not conclusive: what policymakers and health professionals need to know.Breast cancer is a serious health concern and a disease that is not well understood. Early detection remains the best way to prevent debilitation and death. Traditionally, mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) have been accepted as legitimate breast screening modalities. Over the past 5 years, academics, health professionals, and policymakers have seriously questioned the usefulness of BSE after influential organizations such as the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care downgraded their BSE recommendation citing fair evidence of no benefit and good evidence of harm. We briefly review the three large BSE trials, highlighting methodological weaknesses limiting their ability to evaluate its effectiveness, as well as critique the 2001 Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care report on BSE. We argue that it is premature to conclude that BSE is ineffective. Given that most women find their own breast cancer, this article cautions policymakers and health professionals that a prudent approach to BSE promotion should be taken.",M2
17022914,"Breast self-examination.OBJECTIVE: To examine the value of teaching regular breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). OUTCOME: Reduction of benign biopsy rates. BENEFITS: To provide better advice for women about the risks and benefits of BSE, and to ensure that women who choose to practise BSE are taught to perform it proficiently. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Routine teaching of BSE does not reduce mortality and likely increases benign biopsy rates. (I) RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Breast self-examination should not be routinely taught to women. (ID) 2. A full discussion of breast self-examination, including risks, should be provided for the woman who requests it. (IIIA) 3. If a woman makes an informed decision to practise BSE, care providers should ensure she is taught the skills and that she performs self-examination proficiently.

16926925,"Breast self-examination: resistance to change.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Canadian family practitioners routinely teach breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) after publication of the 2001 Canadian Preventive Health Task Force guideline advising them to exclude teaching BSE from periodic health examinations. DESIGN: Self-administered cross-sectional mailed survey. SETTING: Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of English-speaking general practitioners and physicians certified by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Current and past BSE practices and opinions on the value of BSE. RESULTS: Response rate was 47.4%. Most respondents (88%) were aware of the new recommendations, yet only 16% had changed their usual practice of routinely teaching BSE. Most physicians agreed that before the recommendation they almost always taught BSE (74.3%). Only 9.5% agreed that physicians should follow the recommendation and not routinely teach BSE. A few also agreed that they now spend less time discussing BSE (25.7%) and that the recommendation has influenced them to stop teaching (12.4%) and encouraging (12.9%) women to practise BSE. Physicians who had changed their BSE practices were less likely to agree that BSE increases early detection of breast cancer and more likely to agree that BSE increases benign breast biopsies. They were also more likely to agree that screening mammography in women older than 50 decreases mortality from breast cancer. CONCLUSION: This survey, which assessed routine teaching of BSE, revealed poor adherence by Canadian family physicians to a well publicized evidence-based guideline update. Resistance to change could in part be attributed to a lack of knowledge of the supporting evidence, a lack of confidence in the evidence to date, and personal experiences with patients within their practices.",M2
16923834,"Breast self-examination among Chinese immigrant women.The incidence of breast cancer is rising rapidly among the fast-growing demographic group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). In this study, the authors assessed the awareness of breast self-exam (<e>BSE</e>) and factors predicting practice of BSE among Chinese immigrant women living in San Francisco. Three hundred and ninety-seven women participated in a telephone survey; 80.9% reported having heard of BSE but only 53.9% reported practice of BSE during the past year. Logistic regression modeling found that increased length of stay in the United States, higher income, socializing with more Chinese than non-Chinese, and a birthplace other than U.S. and Chinese communities predicted BSE practice. The findings indicate that although familiarity with BSE is high among this group of Chinese immigrant women, self-reported actual practice is far from optimal. This study points to the need for culturally appropriate interventions that will encourage and motivate immigrant Chinese women to practice BSE on a monthly basis.",M2
16883082,"Knowledge of breast cancer and its risk and protective factors among women in Riyadh.BACKGROUND: We conducted this study to assess knowledge of breast cancer and sources of information about breast cancer among women in Riyadh. We also analyzed whether associations existed between demographic variables, knowledge of breast cancer, and the practice of breast self-examination and use of mammography screening. METHODS: Women interested in participating in this community-based descriptive study provided data by completing a pre-tested structured RESULTS: Of 864 participating women, 84% were Saudi, 45% were married and 67.8% had a university level education. Eighty percent were between the ages of 20 to 50 years. Knowledge of breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) was high; 82% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 79.2%-84.4%) knew about BSE, while 61% (95% CI: 57.9%-64.5%) knew about mammography, but only 41.2% (95% CI, 37.9%-44.5%) had performed BSE and 18.2% (95%CI, 15.5%-20.8%) had had mammography screening. Knowledge of breast cancer, risk factors and protective factors for breast cancer was moderate. There was a statistically significant association between the demographic characteristics (marital status, educational status and family history of breast cancer) and knowledge and practice of BSE and CONCLUSION: Though it has limitations, this study revealed an imbalance between the knowledge and practice of BSE among women. It also showed that there is only moderate knowledge of risk and protective factors for breast cancer and that knowledge and practice of BSE and mammograms vary according to marital and educational status. Hence, frequent community-based awareness programs are needed so that all women can know and practice BSE, which in turn helps to prevent breast cancer.",M2
16817030,"Screening behavior in women at increased familial risk for breast cancer.This multicenter study examined the adherence of high-risk women to screening recommendations for breast and ovarian cancer following consultation at a familial cancer clinic (FCC). Self-report questionnaires assessing recall of screening advice, tests undertaken, risk perception, anxiety (Impact of Events Scale) and demographics were mailed to 396 consecutive eligible women who had attended one of six FCCs a median of 3.6 years prior. Family history, genetic test results and screening recommendations were abstracted from medical records. 182/266 (68.4%) women responded with 130 lost to follow-up. The proportions of women undertaking at least the recommended frequency of screening tests were: breast self examination (<e>BSE</e>) 50.4%, clinical breast examination (CBE) 66.0%, mammography 82.2%, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) 70.0%, CA125 84.0%. Factors associated with adherence to screening were: higher anxiety for BSE and CBE, being BRCA1/2 positive for CBE, older age, method of arrangement and having at least one affected first degree relative for mammography. Factors significantly associated with over-adherence were higher scores for anxiety for BSE and CBE and younger age (&lt; 40 years) for TVUS. Between 41.3% (BSE) and 57.6% (CBE) of women incorrectly recalled their screening recommendations. A substantial minority of high-risk women do not adhere to screening advice. Strategies to improve the accuracy of recall of recommendations and the uptake of recommended screening are required.",M2
16796478,"Breast cancer early detection among Chinese women in the Philadelphia area.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among Chinese American women. Previous studies identified disparities in breast cancer screening between Asian and Caucasian women. This study describes breast cancer awareness, attitudes, and knowledge, as well as barriers and facilitators of early detection among Chinese women in Philadelphia. METHODS: A cross-sectional, translated survey was conducted among a convenience sample of 111 Chinese women from the greater Philadelphia area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to describe participant experiences and attitudes, and Pearson correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, and multiple regressions were used to identify significant predictors of breast cancer screenings. RESULTS: Of respondents, 53.2% had ever performed breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). Among women aged &gt;or=40, 53.6% had ever had clinical breast examination (CBE), and 71.1% had ever had mammogram. Knowledge (p &lt; 0.001) and self-efficacy (p = 0.001) predicted BSE ever performance. Having a doctor as information source of CBE (p = 0.001) and belief in family history as a risk factor of breast cancer (p = 0.002) were significant predictors of having ever had a CBE. Having a doctor as information source of mammogram (p = 0.002) was the only significant predictor of having ever had mammogram screening. CONCLUSIONS: This study laid a foundation for developing culturally sensitive breast cancer education and screening programs for Chinese women in the Philadelphia area. Recommendations include a call for physician education to improve breast cancer screening rates in this population.",M2
16796477,"Predictors of breast cancer screening among immigrant Iranian women in California.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the predictors of age-specific breast cancer screening participation among immigrant Iranian women aged 30 years and older. METHODS: Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of women's breast cancer screening. The logistic regression results appear as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In general, screening rates for clinical breast examinations (CBE) and mammography among the participants in the current study were higher than levels set in the year 2010 Health Objectives and those reported for women nationally. These findings are inconsistent with previous studies on immigrant women living in the United States. However, the low rate of breast self-examinations (<e>BSE</e>) is consistent with previous findings of other immigrant women breast cancer screening studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to explore predictors of Iranian immigrant women's breast cancer screening behaviors. This study provides valuable information to healthcare providers as well as researchers and public health educators. The findings can make a significant difference in designing guidelines for culturally sensitive interventions and educational material to improve breast cancer screening behaviors.",M2
16791532,"Factors of breast cancer screening among Korean immigrants in the United States.The purpose of this paper is to assess breast cancer screening rates and explore factors related to all three measures of breast cancer screening, mammography, clinical breast examination (CBE), and breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), among Korean immigrants in the United States. A telephone survey was conducted with 189 Korean women aged 40 and older in Cook County, Illinois. Of this group, 78% had had a mammogram at some point, and 38.6% had had one within the previous year. Fifty-three percent had had a CBE, while 26.1% had had one within the previous year. Whereas 58.1% had examined their breasts before, 46.3% did monthly BSE. Korean women's breast cancer screening rates are improving even though the rates are still lower than screening rates in the United States. Having a regular check-up and being married were strongly related to all three measures of cancer screening. Further in-depth research is suggested to understand KA women's perspectives on having access to care.",M2
16760537,"Increasing our understanding of breast self-examination: women talk about cancer, the health care system, and being women.The author engaged 13 women, aged 30 to 59, in a collaborative research project over several months to explore the meaning of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) to them. Through a series of 11 group discussions, the women developed a critical consciousness of the commonality of their personal experiences in relation to BSE. Although these women valued BSE, their reluctance to perform it was influenced by their perceptions of breast cancer as a lethal disease, the perceived threat it posed to their femininity, and their ability to negotiate an increasingly medical and technological health care system. This study provides insight into the importance of the social environment and shared understandings in influencing women's individual behavioral choices for BSE. It also illustrates the particular value of collaborative health research.",M2
16626796,"Does worry about breast cancer predict screening behaviors? A meta-analysis of the prospective evidence.OBJECTIVE: Many women worry about the possibility of developing breast cancer, but there is conflicting evidence concerning whether cancer worry acts as a facilitator or inhibitor of breast cancer screening. METHOD: We conducted a meta-analysis of 12 prospective studies that measured worry about breast cancer at baseline and subsequent breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) or mammography utilization among 3342 high-risk and general population women. RESULTS: The data consistently show that breast cancer worry has a small but reliable (r = 0.12) association with breast cancer screening behavior, such that greater worry predicts a greater likelihood of screening. We also found that the means for breast cancer worry were consistently in the lower third of the scales, despite differences in measurement approaches, sample utilization, or the date that the study was conducted. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis supports the contention that breast cancer worry may motivate screening behavior, and that high levels of breast cancer worry are uncommon.",M2
16504119,"The knowledge and attitudes of breast self-examination and mammography in a group of women in a rural area in western Turkey.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer appears to be a disease of both the developing and developed worlds. Among Turkish women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to determine levels of knowledge about breast cancer and to evaluate health beliefs concerning the model that promotes breast self- examination (<e>BSE</e>) and mammography in a group of women aged 20-64 in a rural area of western Turkey. METHODS: 244 women were recruited by means of cluster sampling in this study. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic variables, a risk factors and signs of breast cancer form and the adapted version of Champion's Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS). Bivariate correlation analysis, Chi square test, Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis were performed throughout the data analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 37.7 +/- 13.7. 49.2% of women were primary school graduates, 67.6% were married. Although 76.6% of the women in this study reported that they had heard or read about breast cancer, our study revealed that only 56.1% of them had sufficient knowledge of breast cancer, half of whom had acquired the information from health professionals. Level of breast cancer knowledge was the only variable significantly associated with the BSE and mammography practice (p = 0.011, p = 0.007). BSE performers among the study group were more likely to be women who exhibited higher confidence and perceived greater benefits from BSE practice, and those who perceived fewer barriers to BSE performance and possessed knowledge of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: By using the CHBMS constructs for assessment, primary health care providers can more easily understand the beliefs that influence women's BSE and mammography practice.",M2
16427965,"Factors associated with breast cancer screening behaviours in a sample of Turkish women: a questionnaire survey.The purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to identify breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) and mammography rates and to examine variables related to the breast cancer screening behaviours in a sample of Turkish women. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 656 women, attending three health centres and two maternal and health centres, using an adapted version of Champion's revised Health Belief Model Scale. Results showed that 17% of the women reported performing BSE on a regular basis. Women, over the age of 40, 25% reported at least one mammography. Higher susceptibility to breast cancer, higher confidence for BSE, lower barriers to BSE, and having heard/read about breast cancer and BSE were significantly associated with performing BSE. Higher seriousness of breast cancer, higher benefits of having mammography, having heard/read about mammography, and having a gynaecologist as a regular physician were significantly associated with having mammography.",M2
16374894,"Breast cancer early detection, health beliefs, and cancer worries in randomly selected women with and without a family history of breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Early detection practices (EDP) consist of clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) is no longer generally recommended, but many women still perform it. AIMS: To compare EDP, health beliefs, and cancer worries in women with and without a family history of breast cancer in a population-based sample. METHODS: 489 women aged 21-60 were randomly sampled from the entire Jewish female population of Israel; 61 (12.5%) had a family history of breast cancer. Participants answered questionnaires by phone, including demographic details, EDP performance, health beliefs, and cancer worries. RESULTS: Rates of CBE were similar in women with and without a family history (p&gt;0.05). For women over 40, rates of undergoing mammography screening were similar (p&gt;0.05), but regular attendance was reported more by women with a family history (p&lt;0.05). More women under 40 with a family history of breast cancer attended mammography (p&lt;0.05), but only about 14% had ever undertaken mammography screening and 27% had ever undertaken CBE. More than 50% of the women had performed BSE, while significantly more women with a family history reported its over-performance (p&lt;0.01). Women with a family history reported higher perceived susceptibility (p&lt;0.01), higher cancer worries (p&lt;0.05), and fewer barriers to mammography (p&lt;0.05). According to logistic regression analysis, higher odds of EDP were significantly related to perceiving fewer barriers and having higher cancer worries. A positive family history was related to higher odds of women undergoing mammography. Perceived susceptibility was significantly related to higher odds of BSE only. Over-performance of BSE was significantly related to having a positive family history, higher susceptibility, and higher cancer worries. CONCLUSIONS: (1) A high rate of women did not undergo CBE or mammography screening. Women under 40 with a family history of breast cancer who have never undergone CBE or mammography merit special attention. (2) The change in guidelines on BSE necessitates further study of its over-performance in relation to cancer worries. (3) Interventions are needed to promote attendance for CBE and mammography in younger women with a positive family history.",M2
16322886,"Can an instruction video or palpation aid improve the effectiveness of breast self-examination in detecting tumors? An experimental study.INTRODUCTION: Although large randomized trials have not shown benefits for breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), many organizations still endorse the practice. This study aimed to determine whether an instruction video or palpation aid improved the effectiveness of BSE. METHODS: A total of 100 volunteers (50 men and 50 women) with no previous experience of BSE and/or clinical breast palpation were randomly assigned to the following intervention: instruction video seen versus not seen and use of palpation aids versus aids not used. Participants completed psychological trait and previous knowledge questionnaires before the intervention and/or breast examination. Examination was carried out on 24 different sized silicone breast forms, into 20 of which had been inserted tumor equivalents measuring 0.8-3.0 cm in diameter. The dependent variable was the rate of accurate tumor detection--the mean sum of correct positive hits (CPH)--defined as tumors detected within 20 s. Mean CPH values were then analyzed in relation to the interventions and other variables including gender and psychological measures (ANOVA and COVAR). RESULTS: Neither the instruction video nor interaction effects between gender and the instruction video influenced the mean CPH value. Furthermore, the palpation aid was strongly and significantly associated with a reduced detection (p=0.00003). CONCLUSION: Using an instruction video or palpation aid did not improve the effectiveness of breast examination in detecting tumors--a finding which supports results from large randomized studies. It is difficult to understand why BSE is still promoted by various groups.",M2
16167447,"Breast screening education at Australian and Thai worksites: a comparison of program effectiveness.To determine whether a nurse-led breast screening educational program in the workplace improved the breast screening practices and attitudes of women. Worksites are potentially cost-effective and convenient for breast cancer screening education due to their ability to educate several women at one time. This was a collaborative study between industry, university and health services in Australia and Thailand. This was a pre post test group comparative design. Three worksites in Australia and three in Thailand were assigned to one of three groups: treatment (group education), pamphlet only, or control. All groups were assessed pre-education and again 3 months post-education on breast screening attitudes and practices using a mail-out self-report questionnaire. Women were significantly more likely to practice breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) following group education, and were more confident in their ability to detect a breast lump. There was a significant increase in breast screening discussion on the workplace for the Thai group following the group education program. An increase of 25% more women saw having a mammography as a priority. The Thai women had less access to free mammographic screening. They also had more negative attitudes and poorer knowledge regarding BSE and physical breast examination (PBE) than the Australian group, with the education program having a more positive impact on them than the Australian group. Relative breast screening attitudes and practices for the treatment, pamphlet and control groups are also presented. This study provides educators and health promotion professionals with further information on the beliefs and practices of women working in both Australian and Thai industries about breast screening. Education programs such as this one can have a positive impact on attitudes and practices including increased likelihood and confidence in practising BSE, promoting women to have a PBE, and promoting discussion of breast screening at the workplace. The findings suggest that Australian women have greater opportunities to ensure their breast health than Thai women, and that there may be a greater need for programs such as this in countries such as Thailand.",M2
16117898,"[Randomized trial of breast self-examination in 266,064 women in Shanghai]OBJECTIVE: A randomized trial of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) program was carried out to evaluate whether the intensive BSE can reduce the death number of women from breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 266,064 women (age of 30 to 64 years) associated with 519 textile factories in Shanghai had been randomly assigned to a BSE instruction group (132,979 women) or a control group (133,085 women) since 1989. Initial instruction in BSE group included demonstration of proper palpation techniques. It was followed by 2 reinforcement sessions during the subsequent 4 years including video shows, BSE instruction sessions and BSE practice under medical supervision. These activities were continued for 5 years. Attendance at all events was recorded. The cohort was followed through July 2000 for development of breast diseases, and the breast cancer cases were followed up through 2001 for vital status. The data analysis methods used included Kaplan-Meier plots, Log-rank test and Cox modeling. RESULTS: Among women under instruction, 864 breast cancers were detected and 133 breast cancer deaths occurred, and 896 breast cancers were detected and 130 deaths recorded in the control group. The tumor size (P = 0.07), TNM stage (P = 0.39) and cumulative breast cancer mortality rate (P = 0.72) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, more and smaller fibroadenomas were detected in the instruction group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Intensive instruction in BSE can not reduce mortality rate of breast cancer, but more and smaller benign breast lumps can be detected.",M2
16115001,"Differences in breast self-examination techniques between Caucasian and African American elderly women.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) is controversial, recommendations to women are mixed, and reported differences by race in BSE are contrary to what is expected. We attribute this, in part, to measurement error in studies assessing the effectiveness of BSE. We assess differences by race in self-reported BSE while controlling selected sociodemographic indicators, BSE training, embarrassment, and perceived competence. METHODS: Data are from personal interviews with 1011 women ages 50 and older, with approximately equal numbers of African Americans and Caucasians reporting that they examine their own breasts. RESULTS: African American women are more likely than Caucasians to report examining their breasts visually, whereas Caucasian women are more likely than African Americans to report tactile examination of breast tissue, consistent with recommended BSE procedure. CONCLUSIONS: BSE measures must be multidimensional to detect differences by race to guide interventions promoting self-detection of breast lumps, early presentation, and mortality reduction.",M2
16091025,"Eliciting women's preferences for a training program in breast self-examination: a conjoint ranking experiment.OBJECTIVES: Although the clinical grounds for recommending breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) have been extensively debated in the literature, there has been no investigation into women's preferences for BSE training. The aim of this study was to test the conjoint ranking method using data on women's preferences for different BSE training programs. Different econometric specifications were tested and sample subgroup differences were investigated. METHODS: Postal data were collected from 1258 women with and without previous participation in a BSE training program. The women ranked eight hypothetical training programs that were defined in terms of three attributes. Inclusion of a payment attribute enabled the calculation of marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. RESULTS: The marginal WTP for individual training in comparison to group training with 18 to 20 participants was estimated to be 225 Danish Kroner (DKK) to 462 DKK. The marginal WTP for training in groups of eight to 10 participants was 180 DKK to 270 DKK. The respondents also preferred to receive instruction using their own breasts, although this was valued lower than a small group size. The results were similar regardless of whether or not the women had previously participated in BSE training. Around 20% of respondents violated a basic assumption of economic theory, in which the cheaper of two otherwise identical goods should be preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Conjoint ranking can provide comprehensive information about benefit assessment. The approach is cognitively demanding, however, and may cause some respondents to violate the axiom of nonsatiation.",M2
16037727,"The factors influencing the compliance of breast self-examination of middle-aged women.PURPOSE: This cross-sectional survey was conducted to described the compliance of Breast Self-Examination of middle-aged women using a convenient sample, and to examine relationships between the compliance of <e>BSE</e> and Health Beliefs, and the influencing factors on the compliance of BSE. METHODS: The subjects were 373 literate volunteers who were from 41 to 60 years of age who visited 6 public health centers. From June 7, 2004 to August 20, 2004, data were collected by 5 research assistants using a self-report questionnaire. The questionnaire was used to obtain information on the general characteristics, knowledge, health beliefs, and compliance of BSE. RESULTS: The findings of this study suggested that there were significant differences in the scores of the perceived susceptibility and severity between compliers and non-compliers of the BSE. BSE compliance was significantly correlated with knowledge, perceived susceptibility, and perceived severity. The most powerful predictor of BSE compliance was the perceived susceptibility. The perceived susceptibility, the perceived severity, the knowledge and educational level accounted for 41.8% of the variance in middle aged women's BSE compliance. CONCLUSION: Increase in knowledge about breast cancer, with a concomitant increase in both perceived susceptibility and perceived severity could produce a subtle cue or motivating force sufficient to affect a behavior change. Further research is needed to examine the qualitative difference between BSE and other early detection behaviors.",M2

METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Pelotas, southeastern Brazil, in 2002. The study sample comprised 879 women aged 40 to 69 years. Information was collected on demographic, social, economic, behavioral, biological and care management variables. Statistical analysis based on Poisson regression model was carried out. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) was 83.5% (95% CI: 80.9-85.9). Of them, 80.4% (95% CI: 77.3-83.2) carried out BSE at least once a month. The prevalence of clinical breast examination was 83.3% (95% CI: 80.6-85.7). Mammography was occasionally performed in 70% (95% CI: 66.8-73.0) of the sample. Of these women, 83.7% (95% CI: 80.5-86.6) underwent mammography at least once in the last two years. Sixty-two percent (95% CI: 58.7-65.2) of the women interviewed attended a gynecological visit at least once in the last year. The factors mainly associated to the high prevalence of secondary prevention of breast cancer were: higher social status; greater association of risk factors for breast cancer; family history of breast cancer; hormone replacement therapy and previous breast biopsy or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive measures for breast cancer have been widely taken in the study sample; however, data points out to some limitations related to efficacy. Social and economic status seems to be a major determinant to gynecological care access and, consequently, access to secondary prevention of breast cancer.",M2

Of interest here is the relation between cancer worry and adherence to breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) guidelines among the six ethnic groups identified--European American, African American, Haitian, Dominican and English-speaking Caribbean women. There was a significant difference in cancer worry by ethnicity. Logistic regression analysis indicated that education, cancer worry, and perceived efficacy of BSE significantly predicted adherence. Furthermore, there were significant differences among women of African descent in BSE adherence and cancer worry. These differences reflect the emerging need for researchers to empirically and methodically investigate ethnic and cultural factors, as well as emotions and affect in preventive health behaviors.",M2
15957574,"Acculturation and its relationship to smoking and breast self-examination frequency in African American women.The concept of acculturation has been used to understand differences in health behaviors between and within a variety of racial and ethnic immigrant groups. Few studies, however, have examined the potential impact of acculturation on health behaviors among African Americans. The present study has two goals: 1) to reconfirm relations between acculturation and cigarette smoking; 2) to investigate the impact of acculturation on another type of health behavior, cancer screening and specifically breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>). African American women (N = 66) attending an inner-city cancer-screening clinic completed study questionnaires. Results reconfirmed psychometric properties of the African American Acculturation Scale (AAAS); replicated the negative association between acculturation and lifetime smoking status; and found relations between acculturation and women's adherence to BSE frequency guidelines. Findings from this study raise the possibility that specific aspects of acculturation may better explain specific health behaviors.",M2

DESIGN: The subjects comprised 160 undergraduate female students who were selected by simple random sampling and who accepted to participate. METHODS: A survey form, which was prepared under the direction of relative literature by the researcher four 3rd graders of Ege University School of Nursing, was applied to female students. The data collected were assessed after being coded. FINDINGS: The numbers of undergraduate female students performing BSE regularly and their information levels related to the symptoms of breast cancer were found to be very low, but their mean scores for performing BSE after training given by peer guides were increased and the peer group training was found to be effective. CONCLUSIONS: From the results we conclude that the training guide was appropriate for transmitting information to university students for peer group education purposes.",M2
15727985,"The influence of breast self-examination on subsequent mammography participation.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>) influences subsequent mammography participation. METHODS: We evaluated associations between BSE and subsequent mammography participation, adjusting for baseline screening behaviors and sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle characteristics, among women aged 40 years and older using data from the longitudinal Canadian National Population Health Survey. RESULTS: Regular performance of BSE at baseline was not associated with receipt of a recent mammogram at follow-up among all women (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.75, 1.35) or with mammography uptake among the subgroup of women reporting never use at baseline (adjusted OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.50, 1.22). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between performance of BSE and subsequent mammography participation suggests that not recommending BSE is unlikely to influence mammography participation.",M2
15712819,"Culturally appropriate breast health educational intervention program for African-American women.The purpose of this study was to provide a culturally specific intervention program for African-American women to alter selected behavioral risk factors, psychosocial responses, and breast self-care variables. Two primary directional hypotheses were tested with an alpha set at 0.05. These hypotheses were: (1) a Culturally Appropriate Breast Educational Intervention Program (CABHEIP) will lower selected behavioral risk factors (high fat intake, inadequate amount of physical activity, inadequate fiber intake) and selected psychosocial responses (perceived stress, negative coping, low self-efficacy, perceived barriers to Breast Self Examination [<e>BSE</e>] and Clinical Breast Examination [CBE]) in African-American women, 20 to 40 years of age, who participate in the program as compared to whose who do not participate; and (2) a CABHEIP will raise compliance with BSE, proficiency of BSE, and perceived benefits of BSE and CBE in African-American women, 20 to 40 years of age, who participate in the program as compared to those who do not participate. A sample of 120 (N = 120) African-American women was randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups (60 women per group; (n = 60 intervention group; n = 60 attention control group). The sample was obtained from a population of African-American women from four southern and three central Mississippi counties. The intervention group, in clusters of 3 to 9 women, received education on breast cancer, breast self-exams, healthy eating, exercise, and stress management; and heard stories from breast cancer survivors. The attention control group, in clusters of 3 to 8 women, received education on poison control in the home environment. Data was collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and repeated measures of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for covariates. Significant differences between groups for BSE proficiency I (p &lt; 0.0001), BSE proficiency II (p = 0.013), and benefit BSE (p = 0.053) were found. Compliance for BSE approached significance between groups (p = 0.053). Significance to nursing is that education can change outcomes in health promotion for breast cancer in African-American women. Further studies with similar interventions and larger sample sizes are needed to determine other avenues to decrease modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in African-American women.",M2
15690427,"Breast and colorectal cancer screening among low-income women with psychiatric disorders.This study investigated breast and colorectal cancer screening among 196 low-income women being treated for psychiatric illnesses. Main outcome measures included breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), clinical breast examination (CBE), mammography, digital rectal examination (DRE), and fecal occult blood test (FOBT). Results indicated that 49% and 66% of women 40 years of age or older had obtained mammograms and CBEs, respectively, in the preceding year. Forty-four per cent of women 20 years of age or older reported monthly BSE. Forty-six per cent and 35% of women 50 years of age or older reported having digital rectal exams (DRE) or fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), respectively, in the preceding year. Multivariate analyses showed that physician recommendation of screening was the strongest predictor of having obtained a mammogram, CBE, DRE or FOBT in the preceding year. Physician recommendation and self-confidence in performing BSE were the strongest predictors of monthly BSE. These results highlight the importance of physician recommendation of adherence to screening guidelines for breast and colorectal cancer. Because psychiatrists frequently treat psychiatric patients on a regular basis, they are in a unique position to encourage cancer screening and to monitor compliance with their recommendations.",M2

Postal questionnaires were sent to 629 women who had participated in 1998-2000 in the BSE training program run by Ribe County, Denmark, and to a local matched control group of the same size selected through personal registration numbers. Response rates were 77% and 56%, respectively. A significantly greater number of women who had attended BSE training reported that they knew how and when to do BSE, and what they should do if they discovered breast changes (97% compared to 66% in control group). Similar proportions in each group felt confident of finding any breast changes (57%) and believed that routine BSE can influence the chances of recovery from breast cancer (90%). There were also no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the reporting of anxiety as a result of performing BSE (24% and 17%, respectively). The intervention group was significantly more likely to perform BSE regularly (66% compared to 52% in control group) and to use a more correct technique (44% compared to 20% in control group). It was concluded that a formal training program increases the likelihood of regular BSE performance with a correct technique.",M2
15815181,"Predictors of breast and cervical screening in Vietnamese women in Harris County, Houston, Texas.The Vietnamese are a quickly growing, important part of the Texas population. Breast cancer is known to have different biologic characteristics in Vietnamese women. In order to develop appropriate intervention and screening strategies, we conducted a study of barriers to cervical and breast screening in Vietnamese women in Harris County, Tex. Our objective was to characterize the demographic factors, beliefs, and barriers to cervical and breast cancer screening in our study population and test the effect of these on Papanicolaou test, breast self-examination (<e>BSE</e>), medical breast examination (MBE), and mammography use. The Health Belief Model Scales for Measuring Beliefs Related to Breast Cancer (Champion VL, Nursing Research 1993;42:139-143) was the framework used to assess attitudes regarding risk of breast cancer and to design a component assessing risk of cervical cancer. The questionnaire addressed susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, barriers, and health about screening for breast and cervical cancer. It was translated into Vietnamese and back-translated into English prior to use. The questionnaire was mailed to Harris County residents. Those returned were entered into a database. The data were analyzed for validity using Chronbach's alpha. Simple descriptive analyses and nominal logistic regression identified predictors of Papanicolaou test, BSE, MBE, and mammography use. Twelve hundred surveys were mailed out to Vietnamese women using the telephone directory and the church directories in Harris County; 209 were returned and entered into the database. Of the respondents, 67% had ever received a Papanicolaou test; of these, 89% had received a Papanicolaou test within the past year; 55% of respondents had performed a BSE, 45% of patients received an MBE, and 45% of respondents had ever received a mammogram (15% of respondents had a mammogram during the previous year). The most significant predictors of Papanicolaou test, BSE, MBE, and mammography use were marital status (being married), high educational level, lack of barriers, a family history of the cancer, older age, and increased perception of seriousness. Compared to other studies of Vietnamese women, the women in Texas are among the highest users of the Papanicolaou test, BSE, MBE, and mammography. Barriers and incentives to breast and cervical screening were similar to those in other studies.",M2
