20364702,"[Role of free radical oxidation in the development of cardiovascular events in chronic renal failure]AIM: to refine a role of free radical oxidation (FRO), anemia, and endothelial dysfunction in the development of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) at diferent stages of the disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients, including 46 (53%) women and 40 (47%) men with Stages II-IV CRF, were examined. The patients' mean age was 43.6 +/- 14 years. Echocardiography, measurements of the blood levels of hemoglobin, albumin, cholesterol, and uric acid, and determination of blood electrolytic composition were made. Blood creatinine concentrations in the group averaged 0.3 mmol/l. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated from the Cockroft-Goult formula averaged 33.96 +/- 13 ml/min; the duration of CRF was 9.3 +/- 1.6 years. Anemia was detected in 46 (53%) patients. Iron metabolism was estimated from serum ferritin levels. Special studies involved determination of FRO--malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in plasma and serum. The plasma concentrations of endohelin-1 (ET-1), thromboxane A2, and prostacyclin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results. The higher concentrations of MDA and the decreased activities of catalase and SOD, i.e., FRO, correlated with the progression of renal failure. There were also increases in the levels of ET-1 and thromboxane A, and a reduction in the concentration of prostacyclin as blood creatinine levels elevated. Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 43 (50%) of the 86 patients. Its severity depended on the decrease of creatine phosphokinase and the severity of anemia and arterial hypertension. There was a stable correlation between the changes in left ventricular myocardial mass, MDA levels, and catalase and SOD activities. CONCLUSION: The higher level of MDA and the lower activities of catalase and SOD in patients with CRF, which correlate with diminished renal function, confirm that the disease is closely associated with FRO, that, by aggravating anemia and endothelial dysfunction, affects the magnitude of morphological and functional changes in the cardiovascular system in patients with CRF patients.",M1
20199183,"Multiple antioxidants and L-arginine modulate inflammation and dyslipidemia in chronic renal failure rats.The kidney is an important source of L-arginine, the endogenous precursor of nitric oxide (NO). Surgical problems requiring extensive renal mass reduction (RMR) decrease renal NO production, leading to multiple hemodynamic and homeostatic disorders manifested by hypertension, oxidative stress, and increased inflammatory cytokines. Using the RMR model of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), we assessed the effects of twelve weeks' administration of L-arginine and/or a mixture of antioxidants (L-carnitine, catechin, vitamins E and C) on plasma cytokines, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), nitrate and nitrites (NO(2)/NO(3)), lipid profile, blood pressure, and renal function. CRF rats showed increased plasma IL-1 alpha, IL1-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and sICAM-1 levels and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and 10 levels, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. L-arginine treatment improved kidney functions, decreased systolic blood pressure, and decreased inflammatory cytokines levels. Antioxidants administration decreased inflammatory cytokines and sICAM-1 levels and increased IL-4 levels. Combined use of both L-arginine and the antioxidant mixture were very effective in their tendency to recover normal values of kidney functions, plasma cytokines, sICAM-1, blood pressure, NO(2)/NO(3), cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations. Indeed, the effects of L-arginine and the antioxidants on the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines may open new perspectives in the treatment of uremia.",M1
20078664,"Feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection for patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is expected as a curative method for node-negative gastrointestinal cancers. Little is known about ESD for patients with end-stage chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) on hemodialysis. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for patients with CRF on hemodialysis. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with 12 lesions who underwent ESD (stomach, seven; colorectum, three) between March 2002 and August 2007 were retrospectively investigated in terms of the technical feasibility and complications. RESULTS: All the lesions were resected in a single piece and en-bloc and R0 resection rate was 100%. Histology revealed that all the lesions fulfilled the criteria of node-negative cancers. Delayed bleeding requiring blood transfusion on the day after ESD, and shunt occlusion, which necessitated a radiological intervention 7 days after ESD, occurred in one stomach case. Delayed perforation followed by emergency surgery 2 days after ESD occurred in one colorectal case. CONCLUSIONS: ESD for CRF patients may be technically feasible, but substantial risks should be considered. Early detection of late-onset complications is essential with intensive medical check-up for at least 1 week in order to prevent complications from becoming severe.",M1
20071461,"Impact of Cyclin B2 and Cell division cycle 2 on tubular hyperplasia in progressive chronic renal failure rats.To clarify the specific molecular events of progressive tubular damage in chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), we conducted microarray analyses using isolated proximal tubules from subtotally nephrectomized (Nx) rats as a model of CRF. Our results clearly demonstrated time-dependent changes in gene expression profiles localized to proximal tubules. The expression of mitosis-specific genes Cyclin B2 and Cell division cycle 2 (Cdc2) was significantly and selectively increased in the proximal tubules during the compensated period but decreased to basal level in the end-stage period. Administration of everolimus, a potent inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, markedly reduced compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelial cells, which was accompanied by complete abolishment of the expression of Cyclin B2 and Cdc2 enhancement; renal function was then severely decreased. Treatment with the Cdc2 inhibitor 2-cyanoethyl alsterpaullone clearly decreased epithelial cell hyperplasia, based on staining of phosphorylated histone H3 and Ki-67, while hypertrophy was not inhibited. In conclusion, we have demonstrated roles of Cyclin B2 and Cdc2 in the epithelial hyperplasia in response to Nx. These results advance the knowledge of the contribution of cell cycle regulators, especially M phase, in pathophysiology of tubular restoration and/or degeneration, and these two molecules are suggested to be a marker for the proliferation of proximal tubular cells in CRF.",M1
20063701,"[Analysis of the food rations of predialysis patients with chronic renal failure receiving essential amino acid ketoanalogues]The aim of the study was to analyse daily food rations of patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) receiving a supplement containing essential amino acid ketoanalogues (EAAK). The study was carried out on 60 patients with CRF of different etiology. During the progression of CRF, decline of consumption of products being the source of protein and limitation of consumption of products high in energy were observed. This can lead to protein-energy malnutrition. The results of the research emphasize the necessity of providing patients with CRF constant dietician care that would assure possibility to adjust diet to individual needs of every patient as well as to modify it, if necessary, and that would have significant influence on prolongation of the phase of predialysis treatment as well as on better preparation to dialysis.",M1
20043530,"Chronic renal failure in Jamaican children--an update (2001-2006).OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the incidence, epidemiology, aetiology and outcome of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in Jamaican children &lt; 12 years old between 2001 and 2006. METHODS: The required data on all children who fulfilled inclusion criteria were obtained from their medical records at the University Hospital of the West Indies, Bustamante Hospital for Children and from practitioners in hospitals serving children islandwide. RESULTS: Eighteen new children (72.2% male) presented with CRF. The cumulative annual incidence was 4.61/million child population under age 12 years or 1.14/million total population. Congenital urological disease (44.5%) was the commonest cause of CRF, followed by glomerulonephritis (33.3%). Half of the cases of glomerulonephritis were secondary to HIV-associated nephropathy. Although all children with posterior urethral valves were diagnosed before age 6 months and promptly treated, renal failure present at birth proved irreversible. The mean age at diagnosis of CRF was 6.72 years. Ten children (55.6%) were already in CRF at first presentation with renal disease. Of these, the five with non-urological disease were already in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Mortality was 44.4%. Five children died in ESRD without the benefit of dialysis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CRF has increased from the 1985-2000 local study and is mainly due to urological pathology which progresses despite early diagnosis and treatment. Non-urological renal disease is presenting too late for therapeutic intervention. Greater public awareness of symptoms of renal disease is needed. Children's access to dialysis is unpredictable. A paediatric dialysis and transplantation programme is needed.",M1
20015406,"Hepatitis G virus infection in Egyptian children with chronic renal failure (single centre study).BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is an RNA virus. It is mainly transmitted through exposure to contaminated blood although other routes may also exist. Patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) are at high risk of acquiring HGV because they require frequent blood transfusions. Ongoing HGV infection can be only diagnosed by demonstrating viremia in patient sample by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR. Antibodies to the envelop protein E2 (anti E2) of HGV is an indicator of virus clearance and testify past HGV contact. This cross sectional study was done to assess the frequency of HGV exposure (ongoing and past infection) in Egyptian children with CRF and to study the possible risk factors of infection. METHODS: This study included 100 children with CRF [34 on regular haemodialysis (HD) and 66 before the start of dialysis (predialysis)]. All patients sera were tested for HGV RNA by RT-PCR, anti E2, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAB). Twenty five healthy children of matched age &amp; sex were used as controls. RESULTS: HGV RNA was positive in 9 (26.5%) of HD and 9 (13.6%) of predialysis children. Anti E2 was positive in 14 (41.2%) of HD and 19 (28.8%) of predialysis children.In comparison to controls; CRF (n = 100); HD and predialysis children had significantly higher prevalence of anti E2 [4% VS 33% for all CRF cases; (p = 0.002)&amp; 41.2% (p = 0.002) and 28.8% (p = 0.01); for HD and predialysis groups; respectively]. HGV RNA was significantly more prevalent only in HD children in comparison to controls (p = 0.03). HD and predialysis children did not have significant difference in the prevalence of HGV RNA (p = 0.16) or anti E2 (p = 0.26).HGV exposure was not correlated with positivity of anti HCV (p = 0.32), HCV RNA (0.09), HBsAg/HBcAB (p = 1), age (p = 0.06), or gender (p = 0.83). It was significantly correlated with duration of the disease (p &lt; 0.001). Ongoing HGV infection was significantly more prevalent with frequent blood transfusion (p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in serum levels of ALT (p = 0.09), total bilirubin (p = 0.1) and albumin (p = 0.06) in children with ongoing infection in comparison to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HGV exposure in Egyptian children with CRF appears to be high and is mainly related to frequent blood transfusions and longer disease duration. HGV infection in these children is not associated with significant changes in hepatic biochemical parameters.",M1
20007296,"Down-regulation of liver drug-metabolizing enzymes in a murine model of chronic renal failure.Drug metabolism could be altered in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). In rats, this phenomenon is related to a decrease in liver cytochrome P450 (P450) and phase II enzymes, particularly N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). This study attempted to determine the effects of CRF on liver P450 isoforms and NAT2 expressions by using a CRF mouse model. Two groups of mice were studied: CRF induced by 3/4 nephrectomy and control. Liver protein expression and mRNA levels of the major P450 isoforms involved in drug metabolism (CYP1A2, 2C29, 2D, 2E1, and 3A11) and NAT2 were measured by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. CYP3A activity was also assessed by the N-demethylation of erythromycin. Results showed a significant reduction in the protein expression of CYP1A2 (56%), 2C29 (31%), and 3A11 (37%) in CRF mice compared with control animals. Real-time PCR revealed a similar reduction in mRNA levels of CYP1A2, 2C29, and 3A11 (59, 56, and 37%, respectively), in CRF mice. There was no significant modification in protein expression and mRNA of CYP2D and 2E1. Compared with control animals, CRF mice displayed a 25% reduction in N-demethylation of erythromycin. For NAT2, protein expression decreased by 33% and mRNA levels decreased by 23%. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that protein expression of liver CYP1A2, CYP2C29, and CYP3A11 is down-regulated in CRF mice, secondary to reduced gene expression. Phase II enzymes are similarly affected by CRF. Our results will allow the use of knockout mice to determine the mechanism underlying CRF-induced down-regulation of liver drug-metabolizing enzymes.",M1
19938555,"[Evaluate curative effect of chronic renal failure by methods of Bushen Jianpi Huoxue Paidu]OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of curative effect of <e>CRF</e> by Bushen Jianpi Huoxue Paidu and combination western medicine. METHOD: Gather articles mainly of VIP Information and Wanfang Data of the decade to cure CRF by Bushen Jianpi Huoxue Paidu and combination western medicine with random controlled way, and geostatistical analyse with RevMan4. 2 downloading from Cochrane Collaboration. RESULT: The control group was 3.82 (95% CI, 2.72-5.38), in neurofunction 2 al impairment. The serum creatinine SMD = -0.72 (95% CI, -1.08-(-)0.35). Urea Nitrogen WMD = -3.32 (95% CI, -4.34-(-)2.29), P &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSION: In addition to the routine treatment, the method of Bushen Jianpi Huoxue Paidu can be used by using some Chinese drugs to enhance the clinical effect.",M1
19929425,"Chromosome instability in patients with chronic renal failure.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), the presence of cytostaticity, cytotoxicity, and therefore, the possible genetic instability in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in human cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes. METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured from 32 patients with CRF (average 55.2 years) and 18 healthy blood donors (average 44.6 years), and the SCE method was applied afterward. The increase in SCE frequency was evaluated as an immediate DNA damage index, while the reduction in the values of the proliferating rate indices was evaluated as a cytostatic index and the mitotic indices as a cytotoxic index was also measured. RESULTS: A significant increase in the SCE frequencies along with a significant reduction in mitotic indices was observed in patients with CRF compared with the controls. It is notable that there was no significant difference in SCE levels among patients with CRF and cancer, and patients with CRF alone. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates increased genetic instability in patients with CRF. These results could also be of a great importance in early diagnosis to prognosticate a possible generation of neoplasm in the future.",M1
19926968,"Hyperfibrinolysis, uPA/suPAR system, kynurenines, and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic renal failure on conservative treatment.BACKGROUND: Disturbances of the fibrinolytic system and kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism have been postulated as important factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no data are yet available on the associations between these 2 systems in relation to CVD prevalence in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODS: We evaluated TRP and its metabolites, KYN, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and quinolinic acid (QA), and their relations with the parameters of the fibrinolytic system, such as tissue-type plasminogen activators and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activators, plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) levels as the marker of oxidative stress in a population of 50 patients with CRF and 20 healthy controls. In addition, the relations of these parameters to CVD prevalence in patients with CRF were also determined. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the CRF group had significantly increased KYNs, PAP, uPA, soluble urokinase PA receptor (suPAR), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (all P &lt; 0.0001), and tissue-type plasminogen activators (P &lt; 0.01) concentrations. TRP levels were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0001), whereas Cu/Zn SOD levels did not differ significantly between patients with CRF and controls. An accelerated PAP formation was positively correlated with age, inflammatory state, creatinine, uPA/suPAR system, 3-hydroxykynurenine, QA, Cu/Zn SOD, and CVD prevalence, whereas it was inversely associated with TRP levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Multivariable analysis confirmed that QA, TRP, suPAR, and Cu/Zn SOD levels were the independent variables significantly associated with the hyperfibrinolytic state in patients with CRF. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study has demonstrated that hyperfibrinolysis was associated with uPA/suPAR system, KYNs, oxidative status, and CVD prevalence in patients with CRF.",M1
19912987,"Decreased expression of klotho gene in uremic atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) markedly accelerates the development of atherosclerosis, but the pathogenesis of uremic atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. The klotho gene, predominantly expressed in the kidney, plays a key role in regulating aging and the development of age-related diseases in mammals. A loss of klotho results in multiple aging-like phenotypes including atherosclerosis. This study examines the relationship between the klotho expression and the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in uremic state. Eight-week-old apolipoprotein E-deficient (apo-E(-/-)) male mice underwent 5/6 partial kidney ablation to induce CRF or sham-operation. At 6 wk after nephrectomy, CRF mice showed significantly increased aortic plaque area fraction, aortic root plaque area and aortic cholesterol content as compared with non-CRF mice. Serum urea, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher in CRF apo-E(-/-) mice compared with non-CRF controls. Moreover, the expression of renal klotho gene and the serum levels of klotho protein were markedly decreased in CRF mice compared with controls. These results suggested that CRF favored atherosclerosis in apo-E(-/-) mice and uremic atherosclerosis was accompanied by down-regulation of klotho expression.",M1
19903974,"Chronic renal failure: a neglected comorbidity of COPD.BACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, the association between COPD and chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) has never been assessed. Lean mass is frequently reduced in COPD, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) might be depressed in spite of normal serum creatinine (concealed CRF). We investigated the prevalence and correlates of both concealed and overt CRF in elderly patients with COPD. METHODS: We evaluated 356 consecutive elderly outpatients with COPD enrolled in the Extrapulmonary Consequences of COPD in the Elderly Study and 290 age-matched outpatients free from COPD. The GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group equation. Patients were categorized as having normal renal function (GFR &gt; or = 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), concealed CRF (normal serum creatinine and reduced GFR), or overt CRF (increased serum creatinine and reduced GFR). Independent correlates of CRF were investigated by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of concealed and overt CRF in patients with COPD was 20.8% and 22.2%, respectively. Corresponding figures in controls were 10.0% and 13.4%, respectively. COPD and age were significantly associated with both concealed CRF (COPD: odds ratio [OR] = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.17-4.12; age: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.04-1.09) and overt CRF (COPD: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.01-4.66; age: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.04-1.10). Diabetes (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.02-3.76), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.70-4.73), and muscle-skeletal diseases (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.01-3.16) were significant correlates of concealed CRF. BMI (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.10) and diabetes (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.26-4.03) were significantly associated with overt CRF. CONCLUSIONS: CRF is highly prevalent in patients with COPD, even with normal serum creatinine, and might contribute to explaining selected conditions such as anemia that are frequent complications of COPD.",M1
19889871,"Oxidative DNA damage in chronic renal failure patients.BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) patients present a high incidence of cardiovascular pathologies and cancer. This has been attributed to the existence of genomic instability in these patients, and consequently they should present elevated levels of genetic damage. METHODS: To determine the background levels of genetic damage and its specific levels of oxidative damage, a large population of 253 CRF patients (77 in dialysis) was analysed using the comet assay. The percentage of DNA in the tail was used as a measure of basal genetic damage. In addition, the use of endo III and FPG enzymes allowed us to determine the levels of specific oxidative damage in DNA bases. RESULTS: This is the first study that uses endo III and FPG enzymes to measure oxidative damage in CRF patients. Overall genetic damage, as well as specific oxidative damage, was higher in dialysis patients than in the CRF patients with different stages of uraemic state; genetic damage increased when serum creatinine levels increased. Genomic damage in dialysis patients decreased in those patients submitted to dialysis for a long time. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic damage increases when renal function decreases, being maximum in haemodialysis patients. Although part of the observed damage can be attributed to the uraemic state itself, other individual genetic factors can influence a state of genomic instability responsible for the observed genomic damage.",M1
19882571,"Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in chronic renal failure without diabetes mellitus.PURPOSE: To evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) without diabetes mellitus by using optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: Sixty-six eyes of 33 patients with CRF were evaluated. Eighteen patients have been treated with hemodialysis (group 1) and 15 patients have been treated with peritoneal dialysis (group 2). The RNFL thicknesses were assessed before and after the hemodialysis in group 1. None of these patients had diabetes mellitus. Forty eyes of 20 age-matched normal control subjects were assessed in group 3. An RNFL thickness protocol was used to acquire circular scans of 3.4 mm in diameter around the optic nerve. For each eye, RNFL thicknesses were evaluated in 4 quadrants. All of the measurements were automatically calculated by the existing OCT software. All normal subjects and CRF patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. The mean and quadrantal RNFL thickness values in patients with CRF were compared with the control group. RESULTS: The mean RNFL thickness values in patients with CRF were statistically significantly lower than the control group. Differences between the RNFL thickness values in group 1 and group 2 and the predialysis and postdialysis measurements were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The RNFL thickness in CRF without DM, which was measured by OCT-3, was found to be significantly decreased. The presence of CRF can be a source of false positive results and lead to overestimation of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.",M1
19882203,"A large calcified retroperitoneal mass in a patient with chronic renal failure: liposarcoma with ossification.Here we describe a 65-year-old Japanese man with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and a large, dense, calcified abdominal mass. The patient had a history of proteinuria, which was diagnosed as focal glomerulosclerosis. This diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy in 2002, with worsening renal function by July 2005 when a large area of calcification was detected on abdominal radiography, which further increased in size on follow-up radiography in December 2006. The calcified mass was surgically resected and histopathologically diagnosed as myxoid-type liposarcoma composed of dedifferentiated, myxoid, and well-differentiated components with areas of osseous metaplasia. Soft tissue calcifications and ossifications are often benign, but malignant tumors should be considered when the calcified mass is retroperitoneal, occurs in a patient with no history of chronic infection, and is not located near a large joint or associated with administration of calcium carbonate or a vitamin D derivative.",M1
19878707,"Niacin improves renal lipid metabolism and slows progression in chronic kidney disease.BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence points to lipid accumulation in the diseased kidney and its contribution to progression of nephropathy. We recently found heavy lipid accumulation and marked dysregulation of lipid metabolism in the remnant kidneys of rats with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). Present study sought to determine efficacy of niacin supplementation on renal tissue lipid metabolism in CRF. METHODS: Kidney function, lipid content, and expression of molecules involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism were determined in untreated CRF (5/6 nephrectomized), niacin-treated CRF (50 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 12 weeks) and control rats. RESULTS: CRF resulted in hypertension, proteinuria, renal tissue lipid accumulation, up-regulation of scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1), acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1), carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), liver X receptor (LXR), ATP binding cassette (ABC) A-1, ABCG-1, and SR-B1 and down-regulation of sterol responsive element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), SREBP-2, HMG-CoA reductase, PPAR-alpha, fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), and CPT1A. Niacin therapy attenuated hypertension, proteinuria, and tubulo-interstitial injury, reduced renal tissue lipids, CD36, ChREBP, LXR, ABCA-1, ABCG-1, and SR-B1 abundance and raised PPAR-alpha and L-FABP. CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Niacin administration improves renal tissue lipid metabolism and renal function and structure in experimental CRF.",M1
19875380,"The profile of adult nephrology patients admitted to the Renal Unit of the Universitas Tertiary Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from 1997 to 2006.BACKGROUND: This paper reports a retrospective audit of new patients referred to the Renal Unit at Universitas Academic Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa for the decade 1997-2006. METHODS: All the files kept in the Renal Unit were reviewed for the main clinical presentation, a definitive pathological diagnosis (if obtained), age, race and gender of the patients. No consultations from other disciplines were included. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and sixteen patients were included in the study. The main clinical presentations were as follows: chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), 461 (37.9%); nephrotic syndrome, 203 (16.7%); hypertension, 161 (13.2%); and abnormal urinary findings, 128 (10.5%). The nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for renal biopsy, and histological investigation revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 46 (3.8%) patients, minimal change in 23 (1.9%), membranoproliferative disease in 36 (3.0%) and membranous glomerular disease (MN) in 28 (2.3%). In CRF, hypertension was suspected in 236/461 (51.2%) cases but was proven histologically in only 13 (2.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-political factors impacting on access to healthcare most likely had an influence on the referral pattern of patients during this period. The largest group of patients were referred to our institution late in their disease with CRF, often requiring renal replacement therapy, and a definitive diagnosis was seldom possible at that stage. With the limited availability of dialysis facilities, the need for early detection and preventative measures with regard to renal disease in this community is evident.",M1
19857701,"Impact of pancreas transplantation on the quality of life of diabetic renal transplant recipients.Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPKT) is considered to be the best method of treatment for patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) resulting from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The aim of the study was to compare the quality of life (QOL) of patients with IDDM and CRF subjected to SPK or kidney transplantation alone (KTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 21 patients after SPKT with good function of both grafts. The results were compared with 17 patients with functioning kidney grafts. Minimal observation time was 6 months. QOL was evaluated using Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF), which was sent to recipients by post. Results were presented as medians and interquartile ranges of calculated scored KDQOL-SF points. RESULTS: Observation time was 30 months (range, 6-85). Analyzed groups did not differ as regards patient age at transplantation or duration of diabetes and dialysis treatment before transplantation. After SPKT patients reported higher QOL compared with KTA as regards symptom/problem list, 90.91 (86.36-95.46) versus 84.09 (75.00-90.91; P = .04), effects of kidney disease, 90.63 (84.38-93.75) versus 81.25 (68.75-82.14; P = .001); cognitive function, 93.33 (86.67-100.00) versus 80.00 (73.33-93.33; P = .03); overall health, 80.00 (70.00-90.00) versus 50.00 (50.00-70.00; P = .001); physical functioning, 90.00 (75.00-100.00) versus 80.00 (55.00-85.00; P = .03); and pain, 100.00 (90.00-100.00) versus 67.50 (45.00-90.00; P = .005), respectively. CONCLUSION: SPKT had a positive impact on selected parameters of QOL among patients with IDDM and CRF compared to KTA.",M1
19847059,"Elastase, myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide metabolites and oxidative status in subjects with clinical stable chronic renal failure on conservative treatment.We evaluated, in a group of 41 <e>CRF</e> undialyzed subjects (29 men and 12 women, mean age 64.1 +/- 11.3 years), some parameters that reflect leukocyte activation (elastase, myeloperoxidase - MPO), plasma NO metabolites (NO(x)) and the oxidative status (lipid peroxidation expressed as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant status (TAS). Elastase was determined, on plasma separated from fasting venous blood, as elastase/alpha1-proteinase inhibitor complex. MPO was evaluated employing the Myeloperoxidase ELISA kit. The NO production was evaluated by a micromethod. The oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids was evaluated in plasma by detection of the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Total antioxidant status was measured by spectrophotometry. We found a significant increase of elastase, TBARS and NO(x), without any significant variation of MPO and TAS. In this group of CRF subjects, no statistical correlation was found between these examined parameters, creatinine level, creatinine clearance, leukocyte count and hemoglobin level. These findings need to be underlined if we consider that chronic renal failure is an inflammatory condition and this research furtherly supports literature data regarding the role of activated leukocytes in the development of the vascular complications. These observations explain why the examination of leukocyte count and function could become a tool to verify the clinical outcome in these patients.",M1
19839836,"New peritoneal dialysis model in rats with bilateral nephrectomy.Many peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) suffer from metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. However, these abnormalities have been not sufficiently investigated. At present, the resolution of these issues in this field has been hindered by the lack of suitable PD models. We attempt to develop a rat model of PD under no constraints and under non-anesthetization to evaluate amino acid solution as suitable nutritional therapy for renal failure. In our model, bilateral nephrectomy rats were dialyzed 6 h per day for three days. The dialysate was infused and removed continually via a metering pump. Under fasting, rats were infused with 5% glucose or amino acid solution for renal failure, and they remained alive. This model can be used to examine bilateral nephrectomy in rats for three or more days. We were also able to determine protein and calorie malnutrition, negative nitrogen balance, abnormalities in the plasma amino acid pattern, and calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Thus, this model has the characteristics of renal failure in humans and may be used to easily examine the metabolic changes due to loss of kidney function.",M1
19839832,"Referral of patients with kidney impairment for specialist care in a developing country of sub-Saharan Africa.AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the referral pattern of patients with kidney impairment in Cameroon. METHODS: Medical files of patients received at the out-patients department of nephrology from January 2001 to December 2003 at the Yaounde General Hospital were reviewed. Individual information recorded included age, sex, and referral sources. Data on etiologic and co-morbidity factors, clinical signs of <e>CRF</e>, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and biological variables were recorded. Patients were staged for kidney damage in three groups following an adaptation of the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guide recommendations, using the creatinine clearance derived from the Cockroft-Gault equation. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients received during the study period, 140 (77.8%) fulfilled the entry criteria. Men (70%) were more represented, and mean age was 50.19 +/- 1.07 years. Hypertension (62.1%) and diabetes mellitus (26.4%) were the most frequent risk factors. There was no major difference between men and women for most clinical and biological variables. Patients were referred mostly by cardiologist (31.4%) and general practitioners (29.3%). Late referral (GFR &lt;30 mL/min) encompassed 82.8% of participants. Regardless of the referral source, the overall trend was toward late referral. Clinical and biological profiles worsen with advanced stage of kidney impairment. In general, management of patients prior to referral was poor. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed the disconcerting high rate of late referral to nephrologists in this context. Many potential factors can account for this observed pattern, and it is worth investigating to improve referral and outcomes of patients with kidney diseases in Cameroon.",M1
19820757,"[Thyroid dysfunction in children with chronic renal failure]OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and type of thyroid dysfunction in children with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD); and to establish the accuracy of the presence of goiter to identify patients with CRF and thyroid dysfunction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study performed in a tertiary pediatric medical care center. CRF patients younger than 17 years old, with more than three months in PD or HD were included. All patients were assessed regarding their growth and sexual development; thyroid dysfunction was evaluated by serum concentration of thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4L) and triiodothyronine (T3T). RESULTS: 50 patients were included, 25 were male, and mean age was 12 years old. There were 14 (28%) patients with thyroid dysfunction; nine had subclinical hypothyroidism, three patients had euthyroid sick syndrome and two primary hypothyroidism. Thirteen patients had goiter: seven had thyroid dysfunction and in six patients the thyroid function was normal. The sensitivity of goiter to detect thyroid dysfunction was 50% and the specificity was 83.3%. The two patients with the greatest delay in their growth were hypothyroid. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the high frequency of thyroid dysfunction in children with CRF, these patients need a systematic screening, in order to improve their quality of care.",M1
19814639,"Estrogen protects against oxidative multiorgan damage in rats with chronic renal failure.The impact of sex dimorphism on chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>)-induced oxidative multiorgan damage and the effects of estradiol (E(2)) loss and E(2) supplementation on the progress of CRF were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF), and a group of female rats had bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), while the sham-operated rats had no nephrectomy or OVX. Rats received either estradiol propionate (50 microg/kg/day) or vehicle for six weeks. Serum BUN levels were elevated in both male and female CRF groups treated with vehicle, while creatinine level was not significantly changed in the female CRF group. CRF-induced elevation in serum TNF-alpha of male rats was abolished when the animals were treated with E(2), while OVX exaggerated TNF-alpha response. In OVX and male rats with CRF, E(2) treatment reversed the malondialdehyde elevations in all the studied tissues (kidney, heart, lung, ileum, brain, liver, and gastrocnemius muscle), while depletion of glutathione in these tissues was prevented by E(2) treatment. Similarly, increased levels of myeloperoxidase activity, lucigenin chemiluminescence, and collagen in most of the tissues were reversed by E(2) treatment. The findings show that the extent of tissue injuries was relatively less in females, while ovariectomy exacerbated all the indices of oxidative injury. Moreover, the administration of E(2), with its potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, markedly improved CRF-induced systemic inflammatory outcomes in both male and female rats by depressing tissue neutrophil infiltration and modulating the release of inflammatory cytokines.",M1
19809996,"Oxidative stress in elderly chronic renal failure patients: effects of renal replacement therapies on cell membrane fluidity.BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) produce a partial loss of antioxidants and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are a major factor involved in alterations of plasma membrane fluidity and endothelial activation, but their role on plasma membrane fluidity in vivo is still unclear. We compared erythrocyte plasma membrane fluidity, ROS and total plasma antioxidant defenses (Lagtime) in aged patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) on conservative treatment, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) before (HD-pre) and after (HD-post) a treatment, to evaluate the role of different RRTs on oxidative stress and plasma membrane fluidity in aged patients. METHODS: We assessed erythrocyte plasma membrane fluidity, plasma lipid hydroperoxide levels and Lag-Time in 11 CRF patients on conservative treatment, 15 on PD, 12 on HD and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: Hydroperoxides were higher in CRF, PD and HD-post, whereas Lag-time was significantly lower in PD, CRF and in HD-post. CRF, PD and HD-pre also had higher membrane fluidity (rsDPH), compared with HD-post and controls. CONCLUSION: These findings are in keeping with the hypothesis that the Lag-time decrease is due not only to the effect of the RRT but also to the uremic state, and that PD patients undergo a chronic, greater oxidative stress. Contrary to expectations, all patients showed greater erythrocyte membrane fluidity, which can be attributed to uremic toxicity. These observations reinforce the hypothesis that oxidative stress is an intrinsic component of this disease state and indeed is already present also in CRF not yet requiring RRT.",M1
19799202,"[Characteristics of a 24-hour rhythm of blood pressure in patients with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis]AIM: To analyse 24-h rhythm of blood pressure (BP) and its influence on the rate and severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) on replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis - PD). MATERIAL AND METHODS; 70 CRF patients on PD were studied. Their examination included clinical, biochemical tests, automatic 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, transthoracic echocardiography. RESULTS: Non-dipper and night-peaker disorders of BP 24-hour pattern were registered in 81.4% patients irrespective on hypertension severity. Left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy was 87.7% in patients with disturbed 24-h BP rhythm and 53.8% (p = 0.015) in normal BP rhythm. LV myocardial mass index median was 223 and 129 g/cm2 (p = 0.026), respectively. Concentric and excentric models of LV hypertrophy occurred with the same rate in normal and disturbed 24-h rhythm of BP. CONCLUSION: CRF patients on PD are characterized by disorders of 24-h BP rhythm independent of hypertension severity. Night-peaker pattern of BP is a risk factor of development and/or progression of LV hypertrophy.",M1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 240 recipients of primary RA (38% females and 62% males, age 16-69 years, mean age 42 +/- 11 years). A prospective study covered 143 patients. RESULTS: LVH was diagnosed in 52% patients. LVH incidence after renal transplantation (RT) had a wave-like dynamics: during 9 months after RT LVH presents in more than 50% patients; after 9-24 months after the operation it fell to 30% and after 3-7 years after the operation it affected at least 2/3 patients. After RT LVH risk factors were age, duration of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and pretransplantation dialysis, reduced mass of the operating nephrons, arterial hypertension, anemia, functioning of arterio-venous fistula (AVF) and chronic inflammation syndrome. LVH was also associated with factors specific for RT: RA rejection crises, infections complicating massive immunosuppressive therapy. LVH is also associated with proteinuria which may indicate RA damage and can be considered as a marker of generalized endothelial dysfunction. 2-year and longer follow-up after RT confirmed complete LVH regression in 1/3 of the recipients. LVH regression was observed in normal RA function, normal blood pressure, the absence of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, AVF, infectious complications. CONCLUSION: LVH after RT is multifactorial and can completely regress in a favourable posttransplantation course.",M1
19787465,"[Tuberculin skin test reactivity in patients with chronic renal failure]The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of tuberculin skin test (TST) and the parameters that affect the response in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) on different treatment regimens. The study population consisted of 150 patients (78 females, mean age 48.1 + or - 16.7 years, the mean disease duration 6.6 + or - 6.1 years). Of these patients, 50 were on haemodialysis (HD), 50 were renal transplant patients, 26 were on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 24 were treated medically. TST was performed to all patients, an induration with a diameter of 10 mm or more was accepted as positive response in HD, PD, medical treatment groups, whereas 5 mm or more was considered as positive in transplant group. TST was positive in 52% of the study population (56% in HD group, 54% in PD group, 44% in transplant group, 58% in medical treatment group, p&gt; 0.05). There was a positive correlation between TST and age in patients older than 60 of transplant and medical treatment groups (p= 0.008). In HD patients with negative TST, the number of female patients was higher (p= 0.02). In transplant patients with positive TST, duration of HD was shorter (p= 0.01), the blood urea level was lower (p= 0.04), hemoglobin level was higher (p= 0.04). The ratio of negative TST was higher (p&lt; 0.05), TST reactivity was smaller (p= 0.01) in only transplant patients with no BCG scar. The number of BCG scar was correlated positively with TST (p= 0.04). In the medical treatment group, patients with positive TST response were older (p= 0.02) and in PD group the tuberculin reactivity was not affected by any of the patient-related parameters. It must be considered that the response to TST is low in young patients with uncontrolled CRF and under immunosuppressive therapy.",M1
19776735,"The influence of chronic renal failure on drug metabolism and transport.Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) has been shown, in animal models and clinical studies, to significantly reduce nonrenal clearance and to alter the bioavailability of predominantly metabolized drugs. Phase II reactions and drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) are also affected. High levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), cytokines, and uremic toxins are implicated in some of these effects, which have a clinically significant impact on drug disposition and increase the risk of adverse drug reaction.",M1
19775526,"Comparative study of the cellular pharmacodynamics of calcineurin inhibitors between patients with chronic renal failure awaiting renal transplantation and cirrhosis patients awaiting liver transplantation.The in vitro response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to the suppressive effects of calcineurin inhibitors is known to correlate with the clinical efficacy of drugs used in renal transplantations. The present study was conducted to examine the differences of PBMC responses to calcineurin inhibitors between chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) patients awaiting renal transplantation and cirrhosis patients awaiting liver transplantation. The study included 99 CRF patients awaiting renal transplantation and 27 cirrhosis patients awaiting liver transplantation. Twenty milliliters of venous blood was taken 1-7 days before transplantation. The in vitro drug concentrations giving 50% inhibition of PBMC blastogenesis stimulated with concanavalin A (IC(50)s) were calculated. The suppressive effects of tacrolimus against PBMC blastogenesis were more than 10-100 times stronger than those of cyclosporine. The median IC(50) value for cyclosporine against the CRF PBMCs was not significantly different from the median IC(50) value against the cirrhosis PBMCs. In contrast, tacrolimus sensitivity in cirrhosis PBMCs is approximately seven times higher than that in CRF PBMCs. The median IC(50) value for tacrolimus against cirrhosis PBMCs was significantly lower and therefore the effect was stronger in comparison to the CRF PBMCs (p &lt; 0.001). These data suggest that the PBMCs of cirrhosis patients, in comparison to those of CRF patients, are highly sensitive to the suppressive effect of tacrolimus. However, PBMC sensitivity to cyclosporine was not significantly different between the CRF and cirrhosis patients. These observations raise the possibility that treatment with tacrolimus, rather than cyclosporine, may therefore be a better choice to reduce the risks of allograft rejection in liver transplantation.",M1
19750259,"Oxidative stress and nitric oxide deficiency in inflammation of chronic renal failure. Possible preventive role of L-arginine and multiple antioxidants.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of L-arginine and multiple antioxidants on the inflammatory cytokines level, renal functions, blood pressure and dyslipidemia in chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) rats. METHODS: This study was carried out between December 2007 and November 2008 in the Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, King Saud University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Chronic renal failure was induced in 40 rats by renal mass reduction (RMR) and 10 rats were sham operated. Renal mass reduction rats were treated for 12 weeks by L-arginine and/or a mixture of antioxidants (L-carnitine, Catechin, Vitamins E and C) and the effect of the treatments on plasma cytokines, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), nitrate (NO2) and nitrites (NO3), lipid profile, blood pressure, and renal function was examined. RESULTS: Chronic renal failure increased plasma Interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) levels and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and 10 levels. In addition, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were found. L-arginine treatment improved kidney functions, decreased systolic blood pressure and decreased inflammatory cytokines levels. Antioxidants administration decreased inflammatory cytokines and sICAM-1 levels and increased IL-4 levels. Combined use of L-arginine and the antioxidants mixture were very effective in their tendency to recover normal values of kidney functions, plasma cytokines, sICAM-1, blood pressure, NO2/NO3, cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations. CONCLUSION: Restoration of the pro-oxidant/ antioxidants balance with increased NO bio-availability counteracts inflammation, renal impairment and dyslipidemia in CRF. This may open new perspectives for the role of antioxidants and NO precursors in the treatment of uremia and its complications.",M1
19730414,"Combination of chronic exercise and antihypertensive therapy enhances renoprotective effects in rats with renal ablation.BACKGROUND: We assessed the renal protective effects of treatment with moderate exercise (EX), with EX plus olmesartan (OLS), with EX plus azelnidipine (AZN), and with the three together in a rat model of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODS: Male 5/6-nephrectomized Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into six groups according to the following treatments for: (i) no EX (C); (ii) moderate EX with treadmill running (20 m/min for 60 min/day, 5 days/week) (EX); (iii) EX+OLS (10 mg/kg/day); (iv) EX+AZN (3 mg/kg/day); (v) EX+OLS (5 mg/kg/day)+AZN (1.5 mg/kg/day); and (vi) sham operation (S). The rats were then treated for 12 weeks. RESULTS: EX, EX+OLS, EX+AZN, and EX+OLS+AZN showed decreases in the serum creatinine (Scr), an index of glomerular sclerosis (IGS), the relative interstitial volume of the renal cortex (RIV), the number of ED-1 (monoclonal antibody) positive cells (ED1(+)) and the glomerular expression score of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA(+)). EX+OLS, EX+AZN, and EX+OLS+AZN blocked the development of hypertension, increased the number of Wilms' tumor-1 (WT-1) positive cells (WT1(+)); EX+OLS and EX+OLS+AZN blunted the increases in proteinuria. In particular, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ED1(+), alpha-SMA(+), WT1(+), IGS, and RIV in the EX+OLS+AZN were the lowest among all the nephrectomized groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the results, simultaneous treatment of EX, OLS, and AZN showed renal protective effects in this rat model suggesting that the treatment may affect the macrophage infiltration to the glomerulus, the fibroblast accumulation in the glomerulus, the mesangial activation, and the podocyte differentiation.",M1
19718633,"Renal outcomes after liver transplantation in the model for end-stage liver disease era.The proportion of patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) with renal insufficiency has significantly increased in the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) era. This study was designed to determine the incidence and predictors of post-LT chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and its effect on patient survival in the MELD era. Outcomes of 221 adult LT recipients who had LT between February 2002 and February 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who were listed as status 1, were granted a MELD exception, or had living-donor, multiorgan LT were excluded. Renal insufficiency at LT was defined as none to mild [estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;or= 60 mL/minute], moderate (30-59 mL/minute), or severe (&lt;30 mL/minute). Post-LT CRF was defined as an estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/minute persisting for 3 months, initiation of renal replacement therapy, or listing for renal transplantation. The median age was 54 years, 66% were male, 89% were Caucasian, and 43% had hepatitis C. At LT, the median MELD score was 20, and 6.3% were on renal replacement therapy. After a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range, 0.01-5.99), 31 patients developed CRF with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 22%. GFR at LT was the only independent predictor of post-LT CRF (hazard ratio = 1.33, P &lt; 0.001). The overall post-LT patient survival was 74% at 5 years. Patients with MELD &gt;or= 20 at LT had a higher cumulative incidence of post-LT CRF in comparison with patients with MELD &lt; 20 (P = 0.03). A decrease in post-LT GFR over time was the only independent predictor of survival. In conclusion, post-LT CRF is common in the MELD era with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 22%. Low GFR at LT was predictive of post-LT CRF, and a decrease in post-LT GFR over time was associated with decreased post-LT survival. Further studies of modifiable preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative factors influencing renal function are needed to improve outcomes following LT.",M1
19707919,"Investigation of albumin properties in patients with chronic renal failure.The aim of this study was the investigation of HSA properties and its structural changes after modification induced in vivo among patients with <e>CRF</e> who underwent haemodialysis. Application of different fluorescent dyes allowed the investigation of different regions of albumin molecule using ANS, bis-ANS, piren, piren maleimide and fluorescein isothiocyanate. As markers of oxidative modification, the total protein thiol, carbonyls, glycosylated plasma proteins and hydroperoxide were estimated in plasma. Additionally, this study investigated plasma viscosity and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the plasma. Results show that haemodialysis provoked significant changes in conformational properties of plasma albumin, which resulted in the loss of its biological functions. These findings suggest that oxidative stress and glycation of proteins in plasma are developed during haemodialysis. The results depict that one of the features of uraemia is the presence of signs of oxidative stress before haemodialysis. Nevertheless, oxidative stress and glycation of proteins in plasma are exacerbated during haemodialysis and are a complex process.",M1
19689033,"[Tryptophan and its metabolites in renal allograft recipients]AIM: Disturbances in amino acids metabolism are common in chronic renal failure and subside partially after renal tranplantation. Tryptophan (TRP) is one of the most important exogenous amino acids. Its main derivative is L-kynurenine (KYN). Disorders in the TRP metabolism via kynurenine pathway may lead to neurologic disturbances, hypertension and anaemia. The aim of this study was to assess peripheral kynurenine pathway in 28 renal allograft recipients (RAR) (12 women and 16 men) in comparison to 10 hemodialysed patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and 10 healthy subjects. METHODS: TRP, KYN, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKYN), kyn-urenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QA) were determined in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography technique. RESULTS: The plasma concentration of tryptophan in RAR was not significantly different from the control group, but it was almost twice higher than in CRF. There was an increase in most of kynurenine metabolites in RAR as compared to healthy subjects, although not as high as in CRF. We found a significant negative correlation between TRP and serum concentration of urea and creatinine as well as a positive correlation with GFR. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation tends to normalize TRP level and markedly lowers blood concentration of kynurenine and its main derivatives. A significant negative correlation was found between TRP level and the concentration of urea and creatinine. Lowering of the KYN metabolites level may play a role in lessening uremic neurological symptomes as well as hypertension and anemia in kidney graft recipients.",M1
19658276,"Magnesium and zinc status in patients with chronic renal failure: influence of a nutritional intervention.Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) alters the metabolism for a number of elements, and can lead to deficiency of these nutrients. Among the causes of thes alterations are reduced food intake and the low element content of some low-protein diets recommended in CRF. This study aimed to determine whether nutritional status for magnesium and zinc were changed by a nutritional intervention providing patients with CRF with enough information to prepare a low protein diet that met their needs. The effects of the intervention were compared in 40 adult participants divided into two groups. The control group consumed their usual prescribed diet, and the nutritionally instructed group received dietary training to teach them how to choose foods that met their nutritional needs. The study period lasted 12 months. Food consumption was assessed by 24-h recall. Magnesium and zinc were measured in plasma at the start and at the end of the study. Participants in the nutritionally instructed group decreased their protein intake and increased that of carbohydrates, magnesium and zinc. Plasma zinc correlated with glomerular filtration rate, measured as creatinine clearance, (r = 0.37) plasma protein (r = 0.39) and zinc intake (r = 0.63). At the start of the study 1 participant in the control group and no participants in the instructed group had hypomagnesaemia (&lt; 1.8 mg/dL) whereas 2 participants in the control group, and 5 in the instructed group had hypo zincaemia (Zn &lt; 70 microg/dL). After the intervention we observed no changes in the number of participants with hypomagnesaemia in either group, whereas hypozincaemia was found in only 1 participant in the control group and 1 in the instructed group (changes in the instructed group were significant; p &lt; 0.05). Nutritional intervention benefited our participants by improving their ability to choose foods that provided magnesium and zinc while reducing their protein intake. The results of this study indicate that the dietary intervention enabled participants to better control their protein intake and zinc status without detriment to magnesium status.",M1
19632082,"Abnormal antenatal sonogram: an indicator of disease severity in children with posterior urethral valves.PURPOSE: To review the association of an abnormal prenatal sonogram with most recent serum creatinine in patients with proven posterior urethral valves (PUV). METHODS: Since 1992, all live-born patients between 1992-2004 with clinically proven PUV, with postnatally proven PUV, from 2 pediatric tertiary care centers, were reviewed for age at diagnosis, most recent serum creatinine, presence of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) (serum creatinine &gt;2 standard deviations above normal for age), or end stage renal disease (dialysis or transplant). Available antenatal reports from the 2 centres and surrounding community hospitals were reviewed for gestational age (GA) at the time of ultrasound, volume of amniotic fluid, and urinary-tract abnormality. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with proven PUV and prenatal sonograms were identified (1992-2004). Eighteen patients had abnormalities on their prenatal sonogram, with poor outcome in 5 (mean follow-up, 8 years [1-13 y]). No specific features were identified on prenatal sonogram. Sixteen patients had normal prenatal sonograms, with poor outcomes in 2 (mean follow-up, 8 years [3-13y]). There is an increased risk of an abnormal serum creatinine among those patients with an abnormal prenatal study, odds ratio (OR) 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.35-32). CONCLUSIONS: PUV represents a spectrum of disease severity. A normal prenatal ultrasound does not preclude PUV. The majority of patients with a normal prenatal examination have good outcomes. The OR suggests that there may be increased risk for poor outcome in those with an abnormal prenatal examination. A multicenter study is necessary to obtain a larger sample size and more precise ORs.",M1
19624498,"Prognosis of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy in solid organ transplanted patients.Solid organ transplanted patients represent a complex and multi-morbid population with potential acute illness. They are at high risk not only for chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), but also for acute kidney injury (AKI) and little is known about the overall epidemiology or prognosis. We conducted a retrospective review of all solid organ transplant patients who required emergency renal replacement therapy (RRT) for AKI during a period of 7.5 years. We identified 53 episodes of AKI requiring RRT occurring in 51 transplanted patients, and 58.5% of them were freshly (&lt;48 h) transplanted when admitted in ICU. The majority of episodes were a result of cardio-circulatory or septic events (84%), and a large proportion of the AKI episodes were a result of multifactorial causes (27%). Overall 90 days mortality was 49%, and no difference was detected between kidney and nonkidney transplants. On univariate analysis, the risk factors for death were smoking status [OR = 4.09 (CI 95%: 1.16-14.43); P = 0.028] and sepsis [OR = 4.90 (CI 95%: 1.39-17.31); P = 0.014]. Transplanted patients with AKI are younger, more prone to be diabetic and to have previous chronic renal failure compared with the general ICU population, possibly in part because of their immunosuppressive therapy. Nevertheless, they have the same prognosis.",M1
19571386,"First indications demonstrating the preventive effects of NZ-419, a novel intrinsic antioxidant, on the initiation and/or progression of chronic renal failure in rats.The concentration of NZ-419 (5-hydroxy-1-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione), an intrinsic antioxidant, has been shown to increase in the sera of animals and patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). This is the first report that orally administered exogenous NZ-419 prevents the initiation and/or progression of CRF in rats using an adenine-loaded model. After 24 d of adenine loading, there was a ca. 90% decrease in creatinine clearance (C(Cr)) in the control rats. Treatment with NZ-419 from the beginning significantly inhibited the decrease in C(Cr) and also the increase in serum creatinine (sCr). Bio-markers for in vivo hydroxyl radicals, the serum methylguanidine (sMG) level, and sMG/sCr molar ratio, not only in serum but also in the urine, kidney, liver, and muscle indicated that NZ-419 inhibited the increase in oxidative stress induced by CRF in rats. An increase of guanidinosuccinic acid, an another bio-marker of oxidative stress, was also inhibited with NZ-419.",M1
19542895,"Excessive sympathetic activation in heart failure with chronic renal failure: role of chemoreflex activation.OBJECTIVE: Sympathetic activation contributes both to the initiation and progression of heart failure. The role of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in determining sympathetic overactivity in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that in CHF patients, CRF could lead to increase sympathetic activity through tonic activation of excitatory chemoreceptor afferents. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study to examine the effect of chemoreflex deactivation on muscle sympathetic nerve activity in CHF patients with or without CRF. We compared effect of breathing 100% oxygen for 15 min in 15 stable CHF patients with CRF and 15 control CHF patients matched for age, sex, blood pressure and BMI. RESULTS: The baseline muscle sympathetic nerve activity was significantly elevated in CHF patients with CRF as compared with simple CHF patients (61 +/- 3 versus 42 +/- 4 bursts/min; P &lt; 0.01). Administration of 100% oxygen led to a significant decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity in CHF patients with CRF (from 61 +/- 3 to 55 +/- 4 bursts/min; P &lt; 0.05). By contrast, neither 100% oxygen nor room air changed muscle sympathetic nerve activity or hemodynamics in patients with solely CHF. CONCLUSION: Tonic activation of excitatory chemoreflex afferents contributes to increased efferent sympathetic activity to muscle circulation and to blood pressure control in CHF patients with CRF. These findings may have important implications for understanding how CRF contributes to the progression of CHF and increases morbidity and mortality in CHF patients.",M1
19540497,"Plasma angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) concentration is associated with uremic dyslipidemia.OBJECTIVE: Angiopoietin-like protein 3, a liver-derived plasma protein, increases plasma triglycerides (TG) in mice by suppressing the activity of lipoprotein lipase, a key enzyme in plasma TG clearance. Uremic dyslipidemia is characterized by increased TG-rich lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and TG-enrichment of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL. Since the role of angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) in uremic dyslipidemia is unknown, we examined its possible association with the lipoprotein abnormalities in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODS: The subjects were 202 hemodialysis patients, 44 predialysis patients with CRF and 148 healthy control subjects comparable in age and sex. Fasting plasma ANGPTL3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay, and lipoproteins were fractioned by ultracentrifugation. RESULTS: Median (25th-75th percentile range) ANGPTL3 levels were 523 (409-645) and 393 (308-511)ng/mL in hemodialysis and predialysis patients, respectively, which were significantly lower than the control level of 700 (570-875)ng/mL. In the total subjects, ANGPTL3 was inversely correlated with VLDL- and IDL-cholesterol levels, and positively with HDL-cholesterol. ANGPTL3 correlated inversely with TG/cholesterol ratios of both LDL and HDL. In multiple regression models, these associations, excluding TG/cholesterol ratio of LDL, remained significant and independent of possible confounders including age, sex, body mass index, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and adiponectin, whereas the associations of ANGPTL3 with the lipoprotein parameters were less significant when apoC-II/C-III ratio was included in the models. CONCLUSION: The reduced ANGPTL3 level in hemodialysis patients was consistently associated with the major components of uremic dyslipidemia. ANGPTL3 may be a novel factor contributing to uremic dyslipidemia.",M1
19414964,"Causes of chronic renal failure among Iranian hemodialysis patients.Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) is characterized by impaired renal function, which is progressive and irreversible. This study was carried out to investigate the status and causes of CRF in HD patients in Fars Province, Iran. In this cross-sectional study, HD patients were evaluated in Fars province. Information for demographic characteristics, and medical history were obtained by using a questionnaire administered by trained staff. 633 cases including 371 male and 262 female were studied. The mean KT/V was 1 0.4. KT/V &gt; 1.2 was achieved in only 32.1% (203/633) of all patients. The mean BMI was 24 +/- 4.5. The most common causes of CRF were hypertension (30.5%) and diabetes mellitus (30.1%). In conclusion most common causes of CRF in this region were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Better management of hypertension and diabetes could prevent patients from ending up with end stage renal disease.",M1
19408623,"Euthanasia of patients with the chronic renal failure.This study deals with frequency and form of euthanasia in dialysis patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) within the period from 2000 to 2006. Of total number of 2700 patients on dialysis we examined n = 753 of them. Examinees with the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) (n = 348) were in the first group, and the Control group was formed of patients with other diseases (n = 405). In this study the following methods were used: adapted Questionnaire from the Renal Registry of B&amp;H, Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Mini-Mental Scale of Estimation (MMSE). Age of the BEN group of patients ranged: 64.77 +/- 8.86 and the control one 53.85 +/- 3.60. Multivariate analysis for the BEN group with passive euthanasia was: 0.760 (95%, CI = 0.590-0.710) (p = 0.001) and for the active one was 0.450 (95%, CI = 0.125-0.510 (p = 0.001). Euthanasia is associated with the rural life and renal heredity, and psychological BAI scale-total, HDRS-total and MMSE-total. For the BEN group passive euthanasia is 3.75% as well as active 0.86%. The findings stressed that euthanasia of dialysis patients requires better nephrological-psychiatric control and social care in B&amp;H as well as complete program for the CRF samples protection too.",M1
19403200,"[Laboratory manifestations associated with chronic renal failure: what degree of estimated glomerular filtration can be used for its detection in the elderly?]OBJECTIVE: A classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on stages of glomerular filtration (GF) has recently been developed. Thus, chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) is based on GF &lt;60 ml/min. Our goal was to study the presence of typical manifestations of CRF in elderly individuals with a GF of &lt;60 ml/min (stage 3-5) and to determine the cut-off value at which GF can be used to detect these manifestations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in clinically-stable elderly patients attending the geriatrics and nephrology outpatient department. The estimated GF (GFe) was established with the Cockroft-Gault and abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) formulae. Because these patients had a GF of less than 60 ml/min, they were expected to show the manifestations associated with CRF (anaemia, metabolic acidosis, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism). We evaluated the occurrence of these manifestations and the GF cut-off at which they were detected. To do this, the population was divided into two groups: group A: patients with GFe &gt; or = 30 ml/min (stage 3, N=48); and group B: patients with GFe &lt;30 ml/min (stages 4-5, N=8). RESULTS: Seventy percent of the patients had a GFe (MDRD) &lt;60 ml/min (stage 3-5). Despite reduced GF, these patients did not show the typical manifestations of CRF. Group B showed higher plasmatic levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid, and potassium and required treatment with erythropoietin and calcium salts. CONCLUSIONS: Many elderly people diagnosed with CKD with the current classification do not show manifestations of CRF. Estimation of the GF in elders should be generalized to correctly adjust medication to renal impairment rather than to classify elders into CKD stage.",M1
19398802,"Spinal cord compression secondary to brown tumour in a patient on long-term haemodialysis: a case report.Brown tumours may occur secondary to hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). Diagnosing a spinal brown tumour causing cord compression requires a high index of suspicion. We report a 65-year-old woman, who had been on haemodialysis for CRF for over 10 years, who presented with leg weakness and back pain over the thoracolumbar junction. She had a brown tumour at T8 causing subacute spinal cord compression. Ambulation was regained after surgical decompression and stabilisation. Adherence to the National Kidney Foundation guidelines in the management of patients with CRF may prevent renal osteodystrophy. Treatment of spinal brown tumour depends on the severity of the neurological deficit. Remineralization is expected after correction of the parathyroid level, thus negating the need for total excision of the parathyroid glands.",M1
19397334,"Sniffing chronic renal failure in rat model by an array of random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes.In this study, we use an experimental model of bilateral nephrectomy in rats to identify an advanced, yet simple nanoscale-based approach to discriminate between exhaled breath of healthy states and of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) states. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) in conjugation with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of healthy and CRF breath, collected directly from the trachea of the rats, identified 15 common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in all samples of healthy and CRF states and 27 VOCs that appear in CRF but not in healthy states. Online breath analysis via an array of chemiresistive random network of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) coated with organic materials showed excellent discrimination between the various breath states. Stepwise discriminate analysis showed that enhanced discrimination capacity could be achieved by decreasing the humidity prior to their analysis with the sensors' array. Furthermore, the analysis showed the adequacy of using representative simulated VOCs to imitate the breath of healthy and CRF states and, therefore, to train the sensors' array the pertinent breath signatures. The excellent discrimination between the various breath states obtained in this study provides expectations for future capabilities for diagnosis, detection, and screening various stages of kidney disease, especially in the early stages of the disease, where it is possible to control blood pressure and protein intake to slow the progression.",M1
19382088,"[Mortality triplicates in acute myocardial infarction patients affected by chronic renal failure]In order to calculate the cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), we retrospectively analyzed 1482 acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) treated in the ICU at C. Poma General Hospital, Mantua, Italy, from 1 December 2004 to 31 July 2007. Of these patients, 133 suffered from CRF at hospital admission (eGFR &lt;40 mL/min/1.73 m2 body surface and/or serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL). During hospitalization for AMI, the CRF-affected patients showed a 2.7 times higher relative risk of mortality than patients without CRF (Yates chi square 14.46; p = 0.0001432). The evaluated comorbidities (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, supra-aortic vascular stenosis &gt;70%, previous PTCA, COPD, previous AMI, previous coronary artery bypass and chronic obliterative peripheral arteriopathy) increased the relative risk of death 1.2- to 3.76-fold in those affected. In accord with recent evidence in the international literature, our results point to the importance of early assessment of CRF for the prognosis of patients with AMI.",M1
19376216,"Assessment of the renal protection and hepatotoxicity of rhubarb extract in rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Rhubarb is well used to treat chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) in China and Japan, but recent studies reported that the anthraquinone derivatives contained in rhubarb had nephrotoxicity. In this investigation an attempt was made to assess the value and toxic potential of rhubarb to treat CRF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histopathologic and biochemical tests combined with toxicokinetic analysis were performed to investigate the nephrotoxic potential and protective effect of rhubarb extract. RESULTS: In normal rat groups, no death was observed and no renal lesion was found after repetitive administration of rhubarb for 3 weeks. The survival rate, pathologic conditions and biochemical indexes of CRF rats treated with rhubarb at two dosages were all improved and significant amelioration was found in the low dosage group compared to the untreated CRF group. Rhein was the mainly absorbable anthraquinone derivative into systemic circulation after oral administration and the area under curve of rhein in CRF groups was lower than that in normal groups at same dosage. CONCLUSIONS: After 3 weeks of administration of rhubarb extract, there was evidence of protective effect to CRF rats, while incidences of hepatotoxicity with minimal to mild hyaline droplets were also observed in normal rats.",M1
19357177,"Renal mass reduction results in accumulation of lipids and dysregulation of lipid regulatory proteins in the remnant kidney.A significant reduction of renal mass results in proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial injury, culminating in end-stage chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). The accumulation of lipids in the kidney can cause renal disease. Uptake of oxidized lipoproteins via scavenger receptors, reabsorption of filtered protein-bound lipids via the megalin-cubilin complex, and increased glucose load per nephron can promote lipid accumulation in glomerular, tubular, and interstitial cells in CRF. Cellular lipid homeostasis is regulated by lipid influx, synthesis, catabolism, and efflux. We examined lipid-regulatory factors in the remnant kidney of rats 11 wk after nephrectomy (CRF) or sham operation. CRF resulted in azotemia, proteinuria, lipid accumulation in the kidney, upregulation of megalin, cubilin, mediators of lipid influx (scavenger receptor class A and lectin-like oxidized receptor-1), lipid efflux (liver X receptor alpha/beta and ATP-binding cassette transporter), and fatty acid biosynthesis (carbohydrate-response element binding protein, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase). However, factors involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (sterol regulatory element binding protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, SCAP, Insig-1, and Insig-2) and fatty acid oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, acyl-CoA oxidase, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein) were reduced in the remnant kidney. Thus CRF results in heavy lipid accumulation in the remnant kidney, which is mediated by upregulation of pathways involved in tubular reabsorption of filtered protein-bound lipids, influx of oxidized lipoproteins and synthesis of fatty acids, and downregulation of pathways involved in fatty acid catabolism.",M1
19357112,"Clinico-pathological correlations in 127 patients in 11 large pedigrees, segregating one of three heterozygous mutations in the COL4A3/ COL4A4 genes associated with familial haematuria and significant late progression to proteinuria and chronic kidney disease from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in the COL4A3/ COL4A4 genes are currently thought to be responsible for familial benign microscopic haematuria and maintenance of normal long-term kidney function. METHODS: We report on 11 large Cypriot pedigrees with three such mutations. A total of 236 at-risk family members were genetically studied, and 127 (53.8%) carried a heterozygous mutation. Clinico-pathological correlations were available in all of these patients. Renal biopsies in 21 of these patients all showed various stages of focal, segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Thirteen of these biopsies were also studied with EM and showed thinning of the glomerular basement membrane. RESULTS: Mutation G1334E (COL4A3) was found in six pedigrees, mutation G871C (COL4A3) in four and mutation 3854delG (COL4A4) in one pedigree. Clinical and laboratory correlations in all 127 mutation carriers (MC) showed that microscopic haematuria was the only urinary finding in patients under age 30. The prevalence of 'haematuria alone' fell to 66% between 31 and 50 years, to 30% between 51 and 70 and to 23% over age 71. Proteinuria with <e>CRF</e> developed on top of haematuria in 8% of all MC between 31 and 50 years, to 25% between 51 and 70 years and to 50% over 71 years. Altogether 18 of these 127 MC (14%) developed ESRD at a mean age of 60 years. Two members with different mutations married, and two of their children inherited both mutations and developed adolescent, autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ATS), confirming that these mutations are pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm for the first time a definite association of heterozygous COL4A3/COL4A4 mutations with familial microscopic haematuria, thin basement membrane nephropathy and the late development of familial proteinuria, CRF, and ESRD, due to FSGS, indicating that the term 'benign familial haematuria' is a misnomer, at least in this cohort. A strong hypothesis for a causal relationship between these mutations and FSGS is also made. Benign familial haematuria may not be so benign as commonly thought.",M1
19321994,"Reverse cholesterol transport pathway in experimental chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) causes oxidative stress, inflammation, oxidation of lipoproteins, impaired maturation of HDL and accelerated atherosclerosis. Uptake of oxidized lipoproteins by macrophages via scavenger receptors (scavenger receptor class A type I--SR-AI, and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor--LOX-1) leads to foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. HDL mitigates atherosclerosis by retrieving surplus cholesterol via ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 transporters whose expression is regulated by liver X receptor (LXR). Free cholesterol reaching the surface of HDL is esterified by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and sequestered in the core of HDL, thereby maximizing cholesterol uptake. In the liver, lipid-rich HDL unloads its lipid contents via reversible binding to SR-BI while lipid-poor HDL is degraded by the holo-receptor (ATP synthase beta-chain). METHODS: Expression of the above molecules involved in reverse cholesterol/lipid transport was assessed in rats 8 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF) or sham operation. RESULTS: CRF caused heavy accumulation of neutral lipids, upregulation of SR-AI, LOX-1, LXRalpha/beta, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in the aorta, reduction in LCAT in the plasma and no significant change in either SR-BI or beta-chain ATP synthase in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid accumulation despite upregulation of the efflux (LXR, ABCA1, ABCG1) system in the aorta in CRF is largely due to upregulation of influx (SR-AI and LOX-1) pathway and LCAT deficiency.",M1
19288328,"Frequency of metabolic syndrome among hemodialysis patients according to NCEP-ATP III and IDF definitions.Objective. Patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) have an increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. The metabolic syndrome is a common risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, it was aimed to evaluate the frequency of metabolic syndrome using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adults Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definitions in patients with end-stage CRF undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Materials and Methods. A total of 222 cases undergoing HD were enrolled in the study. After obtaining medical history and physical examination, blood samples were collected from each patient for the measurements of fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Results. Among HD patients evaluated according to both IDF and NCEP-ATP III definitions, the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was confirmed by IDF in 56.5% of those fulfilling the criteria for NCEP-ATP III. Similarly, 86% of the undiagnosed patients according to NCEP-ATP III were confirmed by IDF definitions. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of NCEP-ATP III for metabolic syndrome were 81.25% and 64.8%, respectively. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for NECP-ATP III and IDF was 0.730. False-positive rate and probability ratio for NECP-ATP III were 0.352 and 2.49, respectively. In other words, among the patients who were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome according to NCEP-ATP III definitions, the proportion of subjects whose diagnosis was confirmed by IDF definitions was 2.49-fold higher than those with unconfirmed diagnosis. Conclusion. It is logical to evaluate patients with CRF for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors at the time of diagnosis and regularly thereafter due to the high ratio of metabolic syndrome in this population.",M1
19282606,"Predictive value of C-reactive protein for major postoperative complications following off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: prospective and observational trial.BACKGROUND: To prospectively investigate the predictive value of the preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration for major postoperative complications following off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2007 to December 2007, 185 consecutive patients scheduled for elective OPCAB surgery were allocated to a low-CRP group (n=137, CRP &lt;0.3 mg/dl) and a high-CRP group (n=48, CRP &gt; or = 0.3 mg/dl). The incidence of major postoperative complications, defined as postoperative myocardial infarction, and 5 major morbidity endpoints including permanent stroke, renal dysfunction, any cardiac surgery reoperation, ventilation for more than 48 h, and deep sternal wound infection were assessed and compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of major postoperative complications. Patients in the high-CRP group had a significantly higher overall incidence of major postoperative complications, particularly renal dysfunction. In the multivariate logistic regression model, adjusting all the significant univariate predictors, baseline CRP &gt;0.3 mg/dl and preoperative chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) remained as significant independent predictors of major postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preoperative CRP level and/or preoperative CRF indicate increased risk of developing major postoperative complications, particularly acute postoperative renal dysfunction in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery.",M1
19266172,"Selenium, lead, and cadmium levels in renal failure patients in China.Whole blood and serum samples of Chinese stable chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) patients (n = 81), hemodialysis patients (n = 135), posttransplant patients (n = 60), and subjects with normal renal function (NRF; N = 42) were collected, as well as water and dialysate samples from five dialysis centers. The concentration of selenium (Se), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean serum Se levels in patients with different degrees of renal failure were significantly lower than those of subjects with NRF (p &lt; 0.01). Pb levels were not increased in renal failure patients, while the Cd levels in patients with various degrees of renal failure were higher than in subjects with NRF (p &lt; 0.05). After correcting the results of Pb and Cd for hematocrit (Hct) however, Pb levels of dialysis patients were also increased. In the dialysis population under study, blood Pb and Cd levels were closely related to the time on dialysis, while contamination of the final dialysate may also contribute to the increased blood Cd and to a less extent Pb levels. Correction for Hct may be recommended to accurately compare blood Pb and Cd levels in dialysis patients and CRF patients with varying degrees of anemia to those of subjects with NRF.",M1
19250445,"Clinical implications of disordered magnesium homeostasis in chronic renal failure and dialysis.Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body, mainly located within bone and skeletal muscle. The normal total plasma Mg concentration varies in a narrow range, with approximately 60% present as free Mg ions, the biologically active form. The kidney plays a principal role in Mg balance. Approximately 70-80% of plasma Mg is ultrafilterable, and under normal circumstances, 95% of the filtered load of Mg is reabsorbed. As chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) progresses, urinary Mg excretion may be insufficient to balance intestinal Mg absorption and dietary Mg intake becomes a major determinant of serum and total body Mg levels. Until severe reductions in glomerular filtration rate (&lt;30 ml/min), serum Mg levels are usually normal; with lower rates of renal function, serum Mg is increased. Concerning dialysis patients, dialysate Mg plays a critical role in maintaining Mg homeostasis, with serum Mg being largely dependent on the concentration of the ion in the dialysis solution. Magnesium has been implicated in diverse consequences, both beneficial and deleterious, in patients with CRF and dialysis. Potential harmful effects of elevated Mg include altered nerve conduction velocity, increased pruritus, and alterations to osseous metabolism and parathyroid gland function (mineralization defects, contribution to osteomalacic renal osteodystrophy, and adynamic bone disease). Hypermagnesemia also may retard vascular calcification. Low Mg levels have been associated with impairment of myocardial contractility, intradialytic hemodynamic instability, and hypotension. In addition, low Mg has been also linked to carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease and a predictor of vascular events.",M1
19225048,"Curcumin ameliorates renal failure in 5/6 nephrectomized rats: role of inflammation.TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB play important roles in the development of inflammation in chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). In hepatic cells, curcumin is shown to antagonize TNF-alpha-elicited NF-kappaB activation. In this study, we hypothesized that if inflammation plays a key role in renal failure then curcumin should be effective in improving CRF. The effectiveness of curcumin was compared with enalapril, a compound known to ameliorate human and experimental CRF. Investigation was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats where CRF was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). The Nx animals were divided into untreated (Nx), curcumin-treated (curcumin), and enalapril-treated (enalapril) groups. Sham-operated animals served as a control. Renal dysfunction in the Nx group, as evidenced by elevated blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, proteinuria, segmental sclerosis, and tubular dilatation, was significantly reduced by curcumin and enalapril treatment. However, only enalapril significantly improved blood pressure. Compared with the control, the Nx animals had significantly higher plasma and kidney TNF-alpha, which was associated with NF-kappaB activation and macrophage infiltration in the kidney. These changes were effectively antagonized by curcumin and enalapril treatment. The decline in the anti-inflammatory peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) seen in Nx animals was also counteracted by curcumin and enalapril. Studies in mesangial cells were carried out to further establish that the anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin in vivo was mediated essentially by antagonizing TNF-alpha. Curcumin dose dependently antagonized the TNF-alpha-mediated decrease in PPARgamma and blocked transactivation of NF-kappaB and repression of PPARgamma, indicating that the anti-inflamatory property of curcumin may be responsible for alleviating CRF in Nx animals.",M1
19212202,"Impact of dialysis on gastroesophageal reflux, dyspepsia, and proton pump inhibitor treatment in patients with chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in patients with chronic renal failure. Patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis have a high consumption of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and long-term treatment is very common. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (GORS), dyspeptic symptoms, and PPI treatment in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis and to compare the impact of the different types of dialysis on these upper GI symptoms and PPI treatment. METHODS: One hundred and twelve peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 157 hemodialysis (HD) patients participated in the study. The patients were asked to complete two questionnaires: Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale measuring GI symptoms in general and a GI symptom questionnaire evaluating upper GI tract symptoms specifically. Information about the use of and indication for PPI treatment and onset of GI symptoms was obtained by interviewing the patients and/or reviewing the medical records. RESULTS: Dyspepsia was more common among PD patients compared with HD patients (55 vs. 38%, P=0.003). The start of dialysis tended to have a greater impact on dyspepsia (P=0.09) and GORS (P=0.09) in PD patients than in HD patients. The proportion of patients who started PPI treatment after onset of dialysis was high but did not differ between PD and HD patients (51 vs. 44%, P=0.43). A higher proportion of women with chronic renal failure started PPI treatment after the onset of dialysis than men with chronic renal failure (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: Dyspepsia and GORS leading to PPI treatment are common in <e>CRF</e> patients on dialysis. Dialysis in general and the type of dialysis seem to affect the presence of upper GI symptoms.",M1
19203546,"Efficacy of hyperphosphatemia control in the progression of chronic renal failure and the prevalence of cardiovascular calcification.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease mineral- and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) has been studied more often in dialysis than in predialysis CKD patients. The association between efficacy of hyperphosphatemia control and chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) progression, prevalence of bone disease and cardiovascular calcification was the objective of the present investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 patients with CKD in Stage 5, regularly monitored for 5 years, were divided into Group 1 of 20 patients with normal serum phosphate (sPO4) levels and Group 2 of 22 patients with hyperphosphatemia registered at the majority of checks. Serum urea, creatinine, calcium (sCa) and sPO4 levels were regularly determined in the retrospective 5-year period. At the end of this period iPTH, bone alkaline phosphatase-BAP and inflammation markers (CRP, fetuin-A) were measured, valvular and arterial calcifications were detected by B mode echocardiogram and soft-tissue native radiograms of the pelvis and the wrist. RESULTS: Progression of CRF (1/sCr over time) was faster in Group 2 than in Group 1 (b = -0.0577 vs. -0.0288, p = 0.003) during the study period. Average BAP and iPTH values were similar in both groups and 23/42 patients had PTH &gt; 300 pg/ml. Arterial and valvular calcifications were found in 5/23 patients from Group 1 and 14/22 patients from Group 2 (p = 0.011). Linear regression analysis revealed sPO4 as a predictor for total calcification number, inflammatory diseases as a predictor for valvular calcifications, while sPO4 and iPTH were predictors for arterial calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: More than half the patients with Stage 5 CKD not yet on dialysis exhibited elevated PTH. Faster CRF progression and frequent arterial and valvular calcifications were seen in patients with poor phosphate control and sPO4 was selected as an independent predictor of total calcification score.",M1
19194107,"A circulating beta 2-microglobulin intermediate in hemodialysis patients.BACKGROUND/AIMS: A misfolded beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) is a principle component in dialysis-related amyloidosis. However, no such conformational variant of beta(2)m has yet been reported in a clinical setting. Capillary electrophoresis is a tool that can identify the conformational variant of beta(2)m. METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis was used to measure a transitional intermediate from native beta(2)m (N-beta(2)m) to the amyloid beta(2)m. This technique was utilized to assay for intermediate beta(2)m (I-beta(2)m) in serum from 31 hemodialysis (HD) patients before and after HD, 5 patients with non-dialysis chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), and 5 healthy persons. RESULTS:The predialysis values of serum I-beta(2)m and N-beta(2)m were 2.7 +/- 1.4 and 29.4 +/- 6.8 mg/l, respectively, in the HD patients. The presence of serum I-beta(2)m correlated weakly with the total serum beta(2)m concentration in all HD patients. The serum N-beta(2)m concentration decreased significantly during two types of dialysis treatment: by 32.8% on HD using a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane and by 71.2% on online hemodiafiltration (HDF) with a polysulfone (PS) membrane. On the other hand, a dialysis-associated change in serum I-beta(2)m varied from -36.4 to +203.5% in HD patients using PMMA and from -70.8 to +62.5% in online HDF patients using PS. Moreover, a rebound beta(2)m profile suggested that I-beta(2)m might be immobilized in the extracellular space. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that two or three conformational isomers of beta(2)m were probably ubiquitously recognized in human serum. Though no progressive increase in serum I-beta(2)m concentration could be found along with HD, this study shows a significantly poor removal of I-beta(2)m in comparison to N-beta(2)m in patients receiving ongoing dialysis treatment, even with online HDF.",M1
19193724,"Deficiency in Six2 during prenatal development is associated with reduced nephron number, chronic renal failure, and hypertension in Br/+ adult mice.The Br/+ mutant mouse displays decreased embryological expression of the homeobox transcription factor Six2, resulting in hertitable renal hypoplasia. The purpose of this study was to characterize the renal physiological consequences of embryonic haploinsuffiency of Six2 by analyzing renal morphology and function in the adult Br heterozygous mutant. Adult Br/+ kidneys weighed 50% less than those from wild-type mice and displayed glomerulopathy. Stereological analysis of renal glomeruli showed that Br/+ kidneys had an average of 88% fewer glomeruli than +/+ kidneys, whereas individual glomeruli in Br/+ mice maintained an average volume increase of 180% compared with normal nephrons. Immunostaining revealed increased levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin receptors A (ET(A)) and B (ET(B)), and Na-K-ATPase were present in the dilated renal tubules of mutant mice. Physiological features of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) including elevated mean arterial pressure, increased plasma creatinine, and dilute urine excretion were measured in Br/+ mutant mice. Electron microscopy of the Br/+ glomeruli revealed pathological alterations such as hypercellularity, extracellular matrix accumulation, and a thick irregular glomerular basement membrane. These results indicate that adult Br/+ mice suffer from CRF associated with reduced nephron number and renal hypoplasia, as well as glomerulopathy. Defects are associated with embryological deficiencies of Six2, suggesting that proper levels of this protein during nephrogenesis are critical for normal glomerular development and adult renal function.",M1

METHODS: SD rats received 5/6 nephrectomy for preparation of CRF models, and fed 4% casein at the same time. Observed when malnutrition began. Those consistents with malnutrition of CRF condition were randomized into model control group, Ketosteril group, Shenshuai Yangzhen group, and normal control group. After 4-weeks treatment as indicated, The blood parameters, like blood serum albumin (ALB), type-1 insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), total cholesterol (TC), triglyeride (TG), urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), haemoglobin (Hb), 24 hour urineprotein (24hUpr) and weight were determined. Nephrotic tissue was observed by microscope (included HE and PAS). RESULTS: Malnutrition situation in CRF rats began at the end of 10-weeks. After 4-weeks treatment, weight in Shenshuai Yangzhen group were higher significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with model control group, blood serum BUN (P &lt; 0.05), SCr (P &lt; 0. 05) and 24h Upr (P &lt; 0.001) in Shenshuai Yangzhen group were significantly lower with substantially elevated blood serum ALB, Hb, IGF-1 (P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Pathology of Shenshuai Yangzhen group was a meliorated significantly after treated. CONLUSION: Capsule of Shenshuai Yangzhen has a possible therapic effect on improving malnutrition in rats with renal insufficiency.",M1
19168264,"Melatonin: Quantum-chemical and biochemical investigation of antioxidant activity.Experimental and theoretical investigation of the antioxidant activity of melatonin is carried out. The theoretical approach comprises the evaluation of several appropriate descriptors of scavenging activity with the help of quantum-chemistry methods. The values obtained are compared with available data for substances with established antioxidant properties. One of the most widely used markers for in vivo free radical oxidation processes is malondialdehyde (MDA) as an end product of membrane lipid peroxidation. Experimental support of the computed scavenging parameters is provided by estimation of the effect of supplementary melatonin therapy on the plasma levels of MDA in <e>CRF</e> patients on maintenance HD therapy. Different reaction paths have been considered and related to the obtained data, allowing speculations about the reaction mechanism and the antioxidant potential of melatonin for practical purposes.",M1
19159957,"Growth hormone treatment started in the first year of life in infants with chronic renal failure.Infants with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) are at high risk of experiencing severe growth retardation. We report a study of 12 infants with CRF who have been treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) since the age of 0.5 +/- 0.3 years. A control group comprised 15 infants with less severe CRF who were being treated during the same period, but who did not receive rhGH. Despite the infants in the rhGH group had more severe renal failure, they grew at least as well as those in the control group and experienced catch-up growth that started earlier and was more sustained; they also gained more weight. Between the age of 0.5 and 2.5 years, the height standard deviation score (HtSDS) improved from -2.0 +/- 1.2 to -0.9 +/- 0.9 in the rhGH group (p &lt; 0.005) and from -1.6 +/- 1.6 to -1.0 +/- 1.9 in the control group (p=non significant, n.s.). The average gain in HtSDS was +1.1 +/- 0.8 in the treated group and +0.6 +/- 1.4 in the control group (p = n.s.). During the same period, the weight SDS improved from -2.2 +/- 0.9 to -0.6 +/- 1.2 (p &lt; 0.005) and from -1.9 +/- 1.2 to -1.3 +/- 1.2 (p=n.s.) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Nutritional intake was similar in both groups, while parathyroid hormone levels tended to increase, although not significantly, after rhGH treatment (p=n.s.). The results of this pilot study suggest that very early treatment with rhGH in patients with early-onset CRF may improve growth.",M1
19144999,"Adequate phosphate binding with lanthanum carbonate attenuates arterial calcification in chronic renal failure rats.BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphataemia is a risk factor for arterial calcification contributing to the high cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Calcium-based phosphate binders can induce hypercalcaemia and are associated with progression of vascular calcification. Therefore, the effect of lanthanum carbonate, a non-calcium phosphate binder, on the development of vascular calcification was investigated in uraemic rats. METHODS: Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) was induced by feeding rats an adenine-enriched diet for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, 1% or 2% lanthanum carbonate was added to the diet for 6 weeks. Calcification in the aorta, carotid and femoral arteries was evaluated histomorphometrically, biochemically and by ex vivo micro-CT. Chondro-/osteogenic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells was also analysed in the rat aorta. RESULTS: Treatment with 1% lanthanum carbonate (1% La) did not reduce vascular calcification, but in the 2% lanthanum carbonate (2% La) group vascular calcium content and area% Von Kossa positivity were decreased compared with control CRF rats. The aortic calcified volume measured with ex vivo micro-CT was significantly reduced in rats treated with 2% La. Although calcification was inhibited by treatment with 2% La, the chondrocyte transcription factor sox-9 was abundantly expressed in the aorta. CONCLUSION: Treatment of CRF rats with 2% La reduces the development of vascular calcification by adequate phosphate binding resulting in a decreased supply of phosphate as a substrate for vascular calcification.",M1
19143965,"Low-density lipoprotein oxidizability in children with chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND: In childhood, dyslipidemia and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Alterations of these factors have been shown in adult uremic patients. METHODS: Nine children affected by chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>; urinary tract malformation, n = 8; polycystic kidney disease, n = 1) were studied to investigate the abnormalities of plasma lipoprotein concentration and composition and to assess the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. All patients with CRF were on conservative treatment and, after informed consent, underwent the evaluation of (i) quantitative and qualitative plasma lipid profile; (ii) lipoprotein oxidation in vitro; and (iii) lipoprotein anti-oxidant content. These results were compared to those of an age-matched control group of eight healthy children. RESULTS: Total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides were significantly higher in CRF than in the control group. The composition of lipoproteins was different in the two groups: the amount of anti-oxidant factors (alpha-, gamma-tocopherol and carotenoids) was different in CRF and normal controls children, while LDL susceptibility to oxidation was significantly higher in uremic children than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: CRF patients, already before dialysis, have a higher LDL oxidizability due to an altered lipoprotein composition and a low anti-oxidant content; therefore they have higher risk factors for atherosclerosis. On the basis of these data, supplementation with anti-oxidants might be useful in CRF children, but further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic intervention.",M1
19118829,"The calcimimetic R-568 retards uremia-enhanced vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice.OBJECTIVE: Secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic kidney disease promotes vascular calcification. Calcimimetics reduce serum parathyroid hormone, calcium (Ca), and phosphorus by calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) activation. Here we examined possible effects of the calcimimetic R-568 (R-568) on the progression of aortic calcification and atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and the potential implication of aortic smooth muscle cell CaR. METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoE(-/-) mice were assigned to 3 CRF groups and 1 non-CRF group receiving daily gavage with R-568, calcitriol, or vehicle. Serum Ca and phosphorus and parathyroid gland volume of CRF mice were decreased by R-568, whereas elevated serum FGF23 and total cholesterol remained unchanged. Both aortic plaque and non-plaque calcification was lower in R-568 mice, and so was atherosclerotic plaque area fraction. In vitro, R-568 induced a decrease in smooth muscle cell calcification when cultured in high phosphate medium. This decrease was abolished in CaR-SiRNA-transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The calcimimetic R-568 delayed the progression of both aortic calcification and atherosclerosis in uremic apoE(-/-) mice. This effect was mediated via a better control of hyperparathyroidism including serum Ca and phosphorus. Direct vascular CaR activation also could have played a role in the observed effects.",M1
19118252,"Mechanisms of aortic and cardiac dysfunction in uremic mice with aortic calcification.BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) is associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased aortic stiffness. The mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. We examined changes over time in cardiac and aortic function in a murine CRF model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight-week-old mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: wild-type non-CRF, wild-type CRF, apolipoprotein E knockout non-CRF, and apolipoprotein E knockout CRF. Echocardiography was performed and blood samples were taken at baseline and after 6 and 10 weeks of CRF. Vascular reactivity and adhesion molecule expression were studied after 6 and 10 weeks of CRF. Left ventricular hypertrophy, altered left ventricular relaxation, and increased aortic stiffness were observed after 6 weeks of CRF and persisted after 10 weeks. The 4 groups of mice did not significantly differ in terms of arterial blood pressure and aortic structure. The degree of vascular calcification and serum total cholesterol concentration were higher in the CRF groups than in the non-CRF groups. These changes, however, could not explain the cardiac and vascular differences seen in the 2 CRF groups. In contrast, alterations in vascular reactivity, the upregulation of adhesion molecule expression, and CRF status were significantly associated with these changes. CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of CRF, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, and increased aortic stiffness were not related to structural changes in the aorta (including aortic calcification) or high serum cholesterol levels. However, cardiac and aortic abnormalities were associated with the extent of subendothelial dysfunction and the severity of CRF.",M1
19112899,"[Effect of shenshuaining dispersible tablets on the levels of NO, NOS, SOD and MDA in kidney of chronic renal failure rats]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Shenshuaining dispersible tablets on the levels of NO, NOS, SOD and MDA in kidney of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) rats induced by adenine. METHODS: Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group, model control group, Niaoduqing group, Shenshuaining dispersible tablets group(high, middle and low dose). From the second to the sixth group, the rats were prepared for model of CRF by being fed 0.5% adenine. After giving corresponding drugs for 7 weeks, we detected the levels of nitric oxide (NO), total nitric oxide synthase (T-NOS), inducing nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), configuration nitric oxide synthase (cNOS), total superoxide dismutase (SOD), Cu/Zn-SOD and malonaldehyde (MDA) in every rat's kidney tissue. RESULTS: Compared with normal rats, CRF rats' renal tissue's levels of NO, T-NOS, cNOS, T-SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD markedly decreased. Both the iNOS and MDA contents significantly increased. Shenshuaining dispersible tablets could markedly ameliorate above indexes. CONCLUSION: Shenshuaining dispersible tablets can effectively improve CRF rats' antioxidation effect and reduce damnification of free radical and protect the kidney.",M1
19112223,"Utility of predicted creatinine clearance using MDRD formula compared with other predictive formulas in Nigerian patients.The new predictive formula generated during the study of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) to estimate the glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients was found to be superior to existing predictive formulas in all races including black Americans. We had previously published a study evaluating and comparing 5 predictive formulas and their applicability in Nigerian CKD patients and normal subjects. The existing data from this study were re-analyzed and the 5 previous formulas compared with the MDRD formula. All the predictive formulas including the MDRD formula correlated significantly with measured creatinine clearance in CKD subjects and controls. Correlation Coefficient, (r) ranged between 0.908-0.968 and Coefficient of Determination, (r 2 ), ranged between 0.826-0.936. There was also good correlation between the measured and predicted CrCl in healthy state, though the r and r 2 values were weaker (0.718-0.957) and (0.516-0.916). Specifically, MDRD formula was only superior to Jelliffe and Gates and not so to Cockcroft and Gault, Hull, and Mawer equations in <e>CRF</e>. MDRD formula yielded r= 0.93 and r 2 = 0.86 and the values for Cockcroft and Gault, Hull and Mawer ranged between 0.96-0.97 and 0.93-0.94 respectively. In conclusion, MDRD formula, though useful and applicable was not superior to existing formulas. Cockcroft and Gault equation can still be used due to the ease of recall and its high correlation coefficient in health and disease states.",M1
19102359,"Clinical characteristics of lower bowel perforation with chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical characteristics of lower bowel perforation (LBP) with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODOLOGY: In 58 patients with LBP, clinical variables, such as findings of clinical examinations, operative findings, and results of laboratory blood tests were examined as possible prognostic factors for in-hospital death, and compared between CRF and non-CRF groups. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients, 21 died during hospitalization (mortality rate, 36.2%). The mortality rate of patients with CRF was 54.2%. In the patients with LBP, the following variables were significantly correlated with in-hospital death (p&lt;0.05): hypotension, CRF, fecal peritonitis, and low white blood cell (WBC) count, and low albumin and base excess (BE) levels. The odds ratios of in-hospital death were highest for a WBC count of 9000/mm3 and a BE of -3mEqL. Between the CRF and non-CRF groups, significant differences in the rates of age &lt; 70 years, fecal peritonitis, in-hospital death, and low WBC count and BE were found (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We identified prognostic factors of LBP and demonstrated the clinical characteristics of LBP with CRF. These results indicate that patients who have LBP with CRF tend to have immediate sepsis and a poor prognosis.",M1
19092395,"Ocular findings in children with chronic renal failure.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the ocular findings in children with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen children with CRF and 19 age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated. Schirmer and tear film break-up time (TBUT) tests were performed in addition to complete ophthalmologic examination. The presence of dry eye symptoms was noted. Relation between TBUT and Schirmer test results and CRF-related variables such as duration of CRF; dialysis status; and serum calcium, phosphorus, urea, and creatinine levels was evaluated. Student t test and rank correlation test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Dry eye symptoms were detected in 15.8% of children with CRF, against none of the controls (chi(2) = 3.25, P = 0.23). TBUT and Schirmer test results were significantly lower in the study group than in the controls (t = 27.8, P = 0.032 and t = 36.5, P = 0.025, respectively). Within the study group, a negative correlation was found between TBUT and Schirmer test results and the duration of CRF (R = 0.769, Z = 2.234, P &lt; or = 0.022 and R = 0.832, Z = 2.351, P &lt; or = 0.019, respectively). No relation was detected between the TBUT and Schirmer test results and the dialysis status and serum calcium, phosphorus, urea, and creatinine levels in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: The basal tear secretion and tear film stability are lower, and the dry eye symptoms are more common among the children with CRF. The duration of CRF seems to be related with the disturbances in tear secretion and tear film stability.",M1
19090871,"Linking Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services data with prospective DCOR trial data: methods and data comparison results.The Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited (DCOR) trial was a large randomized, multicenter 3-year trial comparing the effects of sevelamer with calcium-based binders on mortality, hospitalization, morbidity, and medical costs in hemodialysis subjects. Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited was prospectively designed to link subjects to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services End-Stage Renal Disease (CMS ESRD) database to collect additional baseline characteristic data and to enhance outcome evaluation. Subjects were linked to the CMS ESRD database by means of an algorithm using several patient identifiers. Some baseline characteristic data were collected exclusively from the CMS ESRD database. Mortality and hospitalization end points were obtained from the CMS ESRD database and compared with similar data collected prospectively into a case-report form (<e>CRF</e>) database. Of the 2103 patients who participated in the DCOR study, 2101 were successfully linked to the CMS ESRD database. Patient baseline data showed that treatment groups were well-balanced, except that a higher proportion of subjects in the calcium-based binder group had atherosclerotic heart disease. Calculated mortality rates were similar between databases, but more deaths were identified in the CMS than in the CRF database. These additional deaths were verified through several sources. More hospitalizations were also detected in the CMS than in the CRF database. The CMS database was a good source of death end points and hospitalization occurrence. Linking patients to the data-rich CMS ESRD database allowed assessment of additional important secondary end points at a relatively low cost compared with prospective data collection.",M1
19090870,"Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity as a risk factor for atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure patients.Paraoxonase is a high-density lipoprotein-associated enzyme and has been shown to reduce the susceptibility to low-density lipoprotein peroxidation. This study aimed to investigate the activity of serum paraoxonase in uremic patients on hemodialysis (HD) and in the predialysis period, and to evaluate the correlations of vascular disease with paraoxonase activity. Thirty patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) undergoing HD (group 1), 30 patients with CRF under conservative treatment (group 2), and 30 healthy controls (group 3) were included. Basal, salt-stimulated, and arylesterase activity were tested by UV spectrophotometry. Serum lipid parameters were determined. B-Mode Doppler ultrasound was used to assess common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Basal paraoxonase, salt-stimulated, and arylesterase activity showed no significant difference between group 1 and group 2. However, it was significantly lower in group 1 and in group 2 than controls. Carotid IMT was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2 and both were significantly higher than controls. Basal paraoxonase-1 (PON1), salt-stimulated PON1, and arylesterase activity correlate with BUN, but only basal PON1 and salt-stimulated PON1 correlate with serum albumin. Linear regression showed that the most significant determinant of carotid IMT was PON1 arylesterase activity in group 1 and arylesterase activity and basal PON1 activity in group 2. Patients with CRF, whether under HD or conservative treatment, have reduced basal and stimulated paraoxonase activities, and this could be an important factor causing increased vascular disease in those patients. Modifying this factor can be of great value to protect against this common complication.",M1
19090253,"Comparison of plasma cardiac Troponin I and cardiac enzymes in haemodialysis patients of Gorgan (south east of Iran).The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on plasma Cardiac Troponin I and cardiac enzymes before and after the dialysis process. Twenty two patients with Chronic Renal Failure (<e>CRF</e>) disease who were haemodialyzed at 5th Azar hospital of Gorgan Dialysis Center were recruited for this study (2005). The patients do not have coronary heart disease. Plasma cardiac enzymes showed no significant difference in the post dialysis group when compared with predialysis. Plasma levels of Cardiac Troponin I in 12 haemodialyzed patients were significantly increased in the postdialysis group when compared with predialysis, whereas plasma level of Cardiac Troponin I in 10 haemodialyzed patients were undetectable (less than 0.1 microg L(-1)). The observation of meaningful increasing level of plasma Cardiac Troponin I in the haemodialyzed patients after the process of dialysis shows that Cardiac Troponin I is highly specific marker for Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) when compared with other cardiac enzymes and is particularly useful for detecting AMI in chronic renal failure and haemodialysis patients which can prevent sudden cardiovascular abnormality and sudden silent myocardial infarction in these patients.",M1
19080229,"[The effects of mycophenolate mofetil on renal interstitial fibrosis and epithelial-myofibroblast translation in adenine-induced renal failure rats]OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on epithelial-myofibroblast translation (EMT) in adenine-induced chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) rat model and the role of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and inhibitor of differentiation (Id2 and Id3) in EMT in the rat kidney. METHODS: Sixty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: normal control (n = 16), CRF (n = 24) and MMF(n = 24). CRF was induced by gastric gavage of adenine (125 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) to rats for eight weeks. CRF rats were treated with MMF (15 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) as  MMF  group. The rats were sacrificed at week 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively. Urinary protein and serum creatinine levels were measured, and the histopathologic degrees of interstitial fibrosis were evaluated in Masson-stained sections. Expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), VEGF and Id (Id2 and Id3) in the kidney tissue were assessed by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and/or Western blot methods. RESULTS: The urinary protein level in MMF group was evidently lower than that in CRF group (P &lt; 0.01), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed in serum creatinine level between the two groups. Renal interstitial fibrosis was reduced significantly with MMF treatment (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of alpha-SMA in MMF group was lower than that in CRF rats at week 6, 8 (P &lt; 0.01), while expression of TGFbeta1 was decreased markedly at week 2, 4, 6 (P &lt; 0.01). The expressions of VEGF in MMF rats were increased significantly at week 6, 8 (P &lt; 0.01), and Id2, Id3 in MMF rats were increased significantly at week 4, 6 (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MMF may ameliorate chronic renal fibrosis and EMT in adenine-induced CRF rats. This effect of MMF on EMT is probably related to upregulation of VEGF, Id2 and Id3 expressions and suppressing overexpression of TGFbeta1 in renal tissue. The exact mechanism needs to be studied further.",M1
19048591,"[Treatment of IgA nephropathy with chronic renal failure]INTRODUCTION: About 25-50% of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) progress toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 25 years. Negative prognostic factors are hypertension, proteinuria &gt;1 g/day, high values of plasma creatinine, and the extension of chronic histological lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Only a few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of treatment in IgAN patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) and most of these had methodological flaws. However, some studies produced interesting results. Alexopoulos and Donadio found that the progression of IgAN slowed down with the use of omega-3 fatty acids; Woo and Nakao used angiotensin inhibitors to obtain the same result, while Ballardie used immunosuppressors. Evidence of treatment efficacy in chronic histological lesions is almost completely lacking. Yoshikawa found that a two-year course of corticosteroids and azathioprine could arrest the progression of glomerular sclerosis, and Shoji obtained similar results using corticosteroids alone for one year. In 2007 we presented the results of a study that compared corticosteroids alone vs corticosteroids and azathioprine in 253 IgAN patients. In all patients, including 46 with serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL, both therapy schemes appeared effective in slowing the progression towards ESRD, even if patients in the azathioprine group experienced more side effects. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, Italian nephrologists preferably use ACE inhibitors alone or associated with corticosteroids in patients with IgAN and CRF. Recently, the Renal Immunopathology Group of the Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN) proposed a therapeutic study that would compare steroids and ACE inhibitors in patients with IgAN and CRF in order to provide more certain therapeutic indications.",M1
19048584,"[The histological picture of <e>CRF</e> in kidney grafts]The most common immunological causes of delayed renal function failure in kidney grafts are recurrent glomerular disease, de novo glomerulonephritis, and chronic cellular or antibody-mediated rejection. Glomerulonephritis can recur any time in the natural history of renal allografts, with the same morphological features of the disease occurring in the native kidney. It has a frequency varying from 100% to 1% and a generally favorable prognosis with the exception of FSGS, SHU and diabetic glomerulosclerosis. The most frequent glomerular diseases to occur de novo in the kidney graft are membranous glomerulopathy, antiglomerular basement membrane disease in patients with Alport's syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type with antinephrin antibodies in patients with NPHS1 gene mutations. Chronic rejection, including chronic transplant arteriopathy and chronic transplant glomerulopathy, is the cause of renal failure in up to 20% of kidney grafts and may occur as early as a few months after transplant.",M1
19048582,"[Kidney diseases with chronic renal failure in the Italian renal biopsy registries]The prevalence of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) at the time of kidney biopsy ranges between 5% and 37% in different renal biopsy registries. This wide variability is mainly dependent on the different definitions of CRF. In the period 1998-2006, the Triveneto Renal Biopsy Registry recorded 816 cases with CRF (defined as serum creatinine persistently &gt; or =1.5 mg/dL), accounting for a prevalence of 27%. At the time of biopsy, the average age and glomerular filtration rate were 54 years and 41 mL/min, respectively; 70% of CRF patients are men and the prevalence of CRF increases with age. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the main histological form of glomerulonephritis, accounting for 23% of all cases of CRF. However, in subjects older than 65 years, membranous glomerulonephritis (MG) exceeds IgAN, thus becoming the main diagnosis in elderly patients with renal impairment. With a cutoff value for proteinuria of 3 g/day, the main diagnoses in cases with proteinuria below and above the cutoff are IgAN and MG, respectively. IgAN remains the main histological form of nephropathy throughout all levels of renal failure. These data confirm the findings of the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies, but correspond only in part with data from other registries. The differences can to a certain extent be explained by the different criteria for the definition of renal impairment, patient selection, and differences in diagnosis among registries.",M1
19059565,"Insufficient therapeutic management of hypertensive patients with renal failure in France.BACKGROUND: Hypertension is both the cause and consequence of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). The prevalence of CRF, which itself is a cardiovascular risk factor, is not well known in France. AIMS: To estimate the prevalence of renal dysfunction among hypertensive patients who were seen by general practitioners (GP); to assess the drug management of hypertension in these patients according to their renal status. METHODS: A transversal observational study among patients of both genders aged 18 or more, with arterial blood pressure greater than 130/80 mmHg (i.e., over CRF-recommended blood pressure) or under antihypertensive drugs who were recruited in France by GP. RESULTS: Among the 2315 included patients, 1908 could be analyzed for their renal function. Of these, 70.5% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 89 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or lower. One third of these patients (31.4%) were suffering from renal failure (GFR&lt;or=59 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). CRF was moderate in 27.9% of patients, severe in 2.20% and terminal (GFR&lt;15 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) in 1.26%. At least one antihypertensive drug was taken by 1952 patients (84.3%), regardless of the patient's renal status. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients who are seen by GP have a high level of renal disturbances and many of them do not reach recommended blood pressure values. This highlights the importance of an early detection of renal dysfunction avoiding progression towards end-stage renal failure and an adapted antihypertensive drugs prescription, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker, acting as renal protectors.",M1
19048834,"[Renal dysfunction and mitral regurgitation in patients with chronic heart failure]The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between mitral regurgitation (MR) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). A total of 340 patients with CHF (200 men and 140 women, mean age 58.0 +/- 12.9 years) were included in the study. Arterial hypertension (AH) was the cause of CHF in 44 (13%) patients, coronary heart disease in 112 (33%) patients, and combination of the two disorders in 184 (54%) patients. CHF of functional classes I and II was diagnosed in 112 (33%) and 177 (53%) patients respectively, CHF of functional classes III and IV in 34 (10%) and 17 (5%) patients. GFR was calculated using the MDRD formula. The left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 56.9 +/- 10.5%. Systolic dysfunction occurred in 90 (26%) patients and mitral regurgitation in 221 (65%). GFR varied from 19.2 to 149.7 (mean 68.8 +/- 2.9) ml/min/1.73 m2. <e>CRF</e> was below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 114 (34%) patients. There was significant positive correlation between the occurrence of MR and the functional class of CHF (r = 0.35; p &lt; 0.001) while GFR was inversely related to MR (r = -0.43; p &lt; 0.001). Multifactor regression analysis demonstrated that manifestation of MR was associated with the decreased functional activity of the kidneys regardless of the patients  age. It is concluded that changes in the structure of the echo signal from the mitral valve in patients with CHF due to coronary heart disease and/or arterial hypertension are most common in patients with GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The degree of MR manifestation is closely associated with the impaired functional activity of the kidneys.",M1
19034881,"UT-A expression in pars recta from a rat model of chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND: Urea transport depends on the diffusion through cell membrane and the facilitated urea transport. Two groups of urea transporters (UT-A and UT-B) have been identified in mammals, and both are involved in intrarenal recycling of urea. The aim of our study was to examine the renal urea handling in rats with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODS: CRF rats were induced by 5/6 nephrectomy followed by a high-protein (HP) diet to increase the progressive loss of renal function for 5 months. Functional studies on water and urea handling were performed. RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to identify UT-A proteins in remnant kidney. RESULTS: A significant decrease in creatinine clearance consistent with development of CRF was observed. The remnant kidneys were hypertrophied, and total renal mass was increased. Urine production increased markedly, whereas urine osmolality and solute-free water reabsorption decreased significantly. Fractional urea excretion was increased reaching values of 105% -/+ 8%. UT-A protein was localized in pars recta by immunohistochemical studies, and it was identified as UT-A2 in outer medulla from remnant kidneys by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. CONCLUSION: In uremic rats, an urea transporter type UT-A2 was expressed in the pars recta, suggesting a possible relation with the fractional urea excretion increase. This expression may be a consequence of an adaptive mechanism in the handling of urea during development of CRF. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the contribution of this mechanism to renal damage observed in the progression of CRF.",M1

Clinical symptoms and EEG dramatically improved 48 h after discontinuation of cefepime. METHODS: Twenty-five cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus associated with cefepime that have been reported in the literature are reviewed. RESULTS: The average age was 60 years [15-86], our patient is the second pediatric patient reported, and 56% of cases occurred in women. The cefepime dosage was adjusted to the renal function in 5 cases. All except 1 patient have impaired renal function (<e>CRF</e>: 17 cases, ARF: 7 cases). The symptoms start 1-15 days after starting cefepime, mean 6 days. The outcome was good after discontinuation of cefepime therapy and anticonvulsant treatment, but lethal outcome was also reported in 2 cases. One fatality was related to status epilepticus. CONCLUSION: The clinicians' awareness must be increased about cefepime-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.",M1
19018737,"[Arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anti-platelet aggregation. Goal oriented treatment]TREATMENT OF ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION - Blood pressure (BP) should be regularly measured in all patients with CKD (Strength of Recommendation C). - BP control and proteinuria reduction delay progression of CKD (Strength of Recommendation A) and reduce cardiovascular risk (Strength of Recommendation C). Thus, control of both factors should be the treatment objective. - The BP target in patients with CKD should be &lt; 130/80 mmHg, and 125/75 mmHg if proteinuria is &gt; 1 g/24 hours (Strength of Recommendation A). - Lifestyle changes should be made: low-sodium diet (less than 100 mEq/day of sodium or 2.4 g/day of salt); weight reduction if patient is overweight (body mass index 20-25 kg/m2); regular aerobic physical exercise and moderate alcohol intake for BP control and prevention of cardiovascular risk (Strength of Recommendation A). - The choice of the antihypertensive drug in patients with CKD depends on the etiology of CKD, cardiovascular risk, or presence of clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease (Strength of Recommendation A). - Two or more antihypertensive drugs are usually required to control blood pressure in patients with CKD (Strength of Recommendation B), and will frequently include a diuretic, which in stages 4-5 should be a loop diuretic (Strength of Recommendation B). - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are first choice drugs in patients with diabetic nephropathy, patients with non-diabetic nephropathy with a protein/creatinine ratio higher than 200 mg/g, and patients with heart failure (Strength of Recommendation A). The combination of ACEIs and ARBs is indicated for reducing proteinuria that remains high despite treatment with a RAAS inhibitor, provided potassium levels do not exceed 5.5 mEq/L (Strength of Recommendation B). - When RAAS blockers are started or their dose is changed in patients with advanced CKD, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be monitored at least after 1-2 weeks. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA - A complete evaluation of the lipid profile including total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides should be performed in any patient with CKD at baseline and at least annually (Strength of Recommendation B). - In patients with stage 4-5 CKD and LDL-C &gt;or= 100 mg/dL, treatment to decrease levels to &lt; 100 mg/dL should be considered because of their high CV risk. This reduction is recommended in secondary prevention and in primary prevention in diabetic patients. Lipid-lowering treatment is recommended in all other patients, although no evidence showing its benefits is available yet (Strength of Recommendation C). - In patients with stage 4-5 CKD and triglyceride levels &gt;or= 500 mg/dL which are not corrected by treating the underlying cases, treatment with triglyceride-lowering drugs may be considered to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. However, treatment with fibrates should be used with caution, and these drugs should not be associated to statins due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis (Strength of Recommendation C). There is little experience on the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with grade 4-5 <e>CRF</e>, but they may be considered a possibly safer alternative to fibrates (Strength of Recommendation C). SMOKING - Smoking is a cardiovascular risk factor and a risk factor for progression of kidney disease in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). - Use of active measures to achieve smoking cessation is recommended in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation C). HOMOCYSTEINE - Hyperhomocysteinemia has been postulated as a cardiovascular risk factor in the general population and in kidney patients, but the available evidence is not consistent. - There is no evidence that vitamin therapy decreases cardiovascular risk in patients with CRF, and recommendation of routine vitamin measurement and start of vitamin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients is therefore questionable (Strength of Recommendation B). LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). - It is advisable to perform an echocardiogram at baseline and every 12-24 months and to consider treatments allowing for LVH regression (Strength of Recommendation C). The approach to LVH should be early and multifactorial because its reversibility is limited once established (Strength of Recommendation C). - RAAS blockade with ACEIs or ARBs partially reverts LVH in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). ANTI-PLATELET AGGREGATION - Because of the high cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD, anti-platelet aggregant therapy, especially low-dose aspirin, would be indicated in patients with type 2 diabetes as primary prevention, and in all patients with CKD as secondary prevention. There is however no evidence of the benefits of anti-platelet aggregant therapy in primary prevention in patients with CKD, particularly in stages 4-5; indication for treatment in this situation should therefore be individualised because of its greater risk of bleeding. - Adequate good blood pressure control should previously be achieved to minimise the risk of haemorrhagic stroke (Strength of Recommendation C).",M1
18972069,"Relationship between serum parathyroid hormone and trace elements (serum zinc and magnesium) in hemodialyzed chronic renal failure children.Secondary hyperparathyroidism and trace elements' metabolism disturbances are common, important, and treatable complications of chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>).The relation between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and some trace elements in CRF patients on hemodialysis is still not completely elucidated. The aim of this work is to determine the serum levels of PTH and the trace elements zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg) in children with CRF under hemodialysis. The relation between PTH and those trace elements will be investigated. The study included 24 children (15 males and nine females) with CRF on regular hemodialysis. Also, 15 healthy age-matched children were included as control group. Serum levels of PTH, zinc, and magnesium were determined in all cases and controls. PTH and magnesium levels in patients were significantly higher than controls. Serum zinc levels were significantly lower than controls. There was a significant negative correlation between serum levels of PTH and zinc as well as an insignificant negative correlation between PTH and serum magnesium in CRF patients. Elevated PTH may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypozincemia. However, this is another negative report on the relation between PTH and serum Mg in children with CRF.",M1
18971153,"Randomized study of darbepoetin alfa and recombinant human erythropoietin for treatment of renal anemia in chronic renal failure patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Darbepoetin alfa can be administered less frequently than recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) for the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) patients. We aimed to confirm that darbepoetin alfa at a reduced dosing schedule can safely maintain a target hemoglobin level in CRF patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. METHODS: Forty-five PD patients receiving r-HuEPO were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue r-HuEPO or to change to darbepoetin alfa (open-label). Patients were maintained within a target range of haemoglobin for 5.5 months by adjusting the dose and then the frequency of darbepoetin alfa and r-HuEPO over the initial 4 months. The evaluation period was the final 1.5 months. A total of 37 patients completed the study. RESULTS: During the evaluation period, the hemoglobin of the darbepoetin alfa group was higher than that in the baseline period (10.46 +/- 0.22 g/dL vs. 9.98 +/- 0.18 g/dL, p &lt; 0.05). Hemoglobin remained similar in the r-HuEPO group. The average dose in the darbepoetin alfa group was 93.0 microg/month, while the average dose in the r-HuEPO group was 18,339.9 units/month. The dosing frequency was less in the darbepoetin alfa group (3.9 times/month vs. 9.2 times/month). We divided the darbepoetin alfa group into low-dose (&lt; 70 microg/month) and high-dose (&gt; or = 70 microg/month) subgroups. The body weight in the high-dose group was higher than that in the low-dose group (66 +/- 11 kg vs. 52 +/- 4.4 kg, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Both darbepoetin alfa and r-HuEPO safely maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range in peritoneal dialysis patients.",M1
18958501,"Chronic renal failure in Sudanese children: aetiology and outcomes.The provision of tertiary paediatric nephrology facilities has led to increasing referrals of children with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). We report the aetiology and outcomes over 5 years, during which period the improving socio-economic situation has allowed increasing provision of dialysis and transplantation. The records of 205 children (124 male; 60.5%) who were referred to a tertiary paediatric nephrology unit in Khartoum between 2001 and 2006 with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 50 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) body surface area were reviewed. The mean age at the time of diagnosis with CRF was 9.8 years (range 3 months-17 years). The aetiology was chronic glomerulonephritis in 52 (25.4%), congenital urological malformations in 36 (17.5%), urolithiasis in 19 (9.3%), hereditary nephropathy in 14 (6.8%), multisystem diseases in 4 (2%), and cause unknown in 80 (39.1%). Of the 205 children, 136 (63%) had reached end-stage renal failure, with chronic haemodialysis being undertaken in 48 (35.3%), intermittent peritoneal dialysis in 43 (31.6%), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in 17 (14.7%), and no treatment in 25 (18.4%). At the end of the study period 53 of the 205 (25.9%) remained on dialysis, 51 (25%) were on conservative treatment, 8 (3.9%) had received transplants, 48 (23.4%) had died, and 45 (22%) had been lost to follow-up. The results illustrate the geographical variations in CRF aetiology in different countries, which may be influenced by current patterns of referral as well as environmental and society factors. The large number with an unknown aetiology for their CRF requires further prospective investigation. We hope the current high mortality rate will improve with earlier referral, improved nutrition, family support, and better access to treatment modalities, especially the provision of kidney transplantation from living related donors.",M1
18957021,"[The value of troponin T as a marker of ischemic heart disease in renal insufficiency]Cardiovascular mortality in patients with Chronic Renal Failure (<e>CRF</e>) is high. Cardiac Troponins (Tn) are today the most specific biomarkers for myocardial damage, although they may be elevated in situations other than the Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Its elevation is mandatory to diagnose AMI, although other simultaneous factors are necessary for the diagnosis. In any patient with a clinical presentation compatible with ACS any increase in Tn indicates AMI and high risk, thus conditioning more aggressive treatment. In CRF cardiac Tn are elevated at baseline in a variable magnitude and in a different percentage of patients according to the degree of renal failure and the number of risk factors which favour such elevation. The reasons for it are not clear. Nevertheless, the clinical interpretation and attitude when there is a suspicion of ACS must be the same in the general population and in patients with CRF. In case of doubt serial samples of Tn may be useful to suggest myocardial damage. On the other side, in asymptomatic patients with or without CRF its elevation at baseline seems to be an independent marker of risk for both global and cardiac mortality. Despite the probability of basal elevation of Tn in patients with CRF, its routine measurement is not recommended neither to compare it with the value obtained in a situation of suspicion of ACS, because the serial samples obtained during the event give more accurate information, nor for stratification of mortality risk, because there is no data to confirm that a therapeutic intervention or an aggressive diagnostic measure based on chronic elevations of Tn are useful. In the general population both TnI and TnT give similar information, but in patients with CRF TnT is clearly preferred.",M1

The aim of the study was to compare cardiovascular risk calculated with SCORE system at patients with different degree of renal impairment. The study included 90 patients divided in 4 groups: 1st group=30 patients without renal failure, 2nd group=25 patients with <e>CRF</e> in predialysis stage, 3rd group=19 hemodialysis non-diabetic patients and 4th group=16 hemodialysis diabetics patients. SCORE was calculated from age, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol levels. There were no significant differences in age and blood pressure in four examined groups. The incidence of smokers and cholesterol level were higher in predialysis patients. The highest SCORE was calculated in predialysis patients: 1st group: 2.5+/-1.8; 2nd group: 5.3+/-4.3, 3rd group: 3.7+/-1.1 and 4th group: 4.06+/-4. We supposed that traditional risk factors from SCORE risk system are suitable to explain the cardiovascular risk and mortality in all population but underestimates cardiovascular risk of high-risk groups like patients with chronic renal disease.",M1

18922701,"Serum fetuin--a concentrations are inversely related to cytokine concentrations in patients with chronic renal failure.BACKGROUND/AIMS: A close relationship exists between inflammation and vascular calcification. Although fetuin-A is known to be an inhibitor of calcification, studies correlating levels of this glycoprotein to markers of inflammation are limited. To understand these relationships, we investigated the relationship between serum fetuin-A and proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). METHODS: Thirty-two patients on haemodialysis (HD), 32 conservatively managed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and a control group of 25 subjects with normal renal function were enrolled in this study. Serum fetuin-A, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum fetuin-A and IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were investigated by the Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: In 64 CRF patients (on HD and with CKD), serum fetuin-A was significantly and inversely related to IL-1beta (P&lt;0.001), IL-6 (P=0.025) and TNF-alpha levels (P=0.007), respectively. The serum fetuin-A levels of the control subjects were not significantly correlated to levels of the inflammatory markers IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (P=0.551, 0.985 and 0.984, respectively). CONCLUSION: The negative correlation between serum fetuin-A and cytokine concentrations in CRF patients supports the hypothesis of inflammation-dependent down-regulation of fetuin-A expression.",M1

AIM: To verify the influence of chronic renal failure on the prevalence of myringosclerosis. METHOD: The otoscopic examination was done in 341 chronic renal failure patients and in 356 normal control individuals. The frequency of positive otoscopies was compared between the two groups, based on individual variables and those pertaining to CRF. RESULTS: 11.7% of the patients had a positive otoscopy in the CRF group, compared to 5.1% in the control group. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of myringosclerosis according to gender, ethnic group, time of dialysis or serum minerals. The groups had a wide age range. CONCLUSION: Although the findings of this study suggest a higher occurrence of myringosclerosis in patients with renal disease, they do not provide a basis for stating that there is any relation between renal failure and tympanic alterations.",M1
18831015,"Pap smear findings in chronic renal failure patients compared with the normal population according to Bethesda 2001.Dialysis remains the most common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the increased risk of cancer after renal transplant is well documented, there is less certainty about the risk of cancer in patients treated only with dialysis. From 1997 to 2002, 262 ESRD patients received a Pap test at Başkent University. The smears of 149 patients who had ESRD for more than 9 months were compared with the smears of 150 otherwise healthy patients. All of the Pap smears were re-examined according to Bethesda 2001 criteria. The mean age of the patients was 42.88 years. Regarding micro-organisms, no statistically significant difference between the groups were observed. In 36 Pap smears, a shift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis was detected. There were statistically significant differences between the groups. When age was considered as a marker of atrophy, atrophy in patients younger than 50 years was statistically different between the groups. Also, we determined that the shift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis and atrophy in patients aged younger than 50 years did not depend on the length of hemodialysis. Of 13 patients (4.3%) who had epithelial cell abnormalities there were not statistically significant differences between the groups. In conclusion, according to our study, <e>CRF</e> seems not to be a predictive factor for cervical cancer. Shift in flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis and atrophy in patients aged younger than 50 years might be the natural effects of uremia, and they appear not to be dependent on the length of the hemodialysis period.",M1

18809976,"Ghrelin and other appetite-regulating hormones in paediatric patients with chronic renal failure during dialysis and following kidney transplantation.BACKGROUND: Patients with renal insufficiency often suffer from cachexia and growth retardation due to low appetite and increased resting metabolic rate. The neuroendocrine hormone ghrelin, a growth hormone secretagogue, enhances food intake, but its role in the development of a cachectic state in renal insufficiency is unclear. Objective. The aim of our study was to investigate the plasma concentration of total ghrelin and other hormones involved in appetite regulation in children with preterminal chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>, n = 24), children undergoing dialysis (n = 19), children after renal transplantation (RTx, n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 10). RESULTS: Total ghrelin was significantly elevated in CRF patients (1370 +/- 182 pg/ml; mean +/- SEM) when compared to control subjects (682 +/- 106 pg/ml; P = 0.016) or patients following RTx (859 +/- 51 pg/ml; P = 0.002). Furthermore, a negative correlation between glomerular filtration rate and total ghrelin was observed in CRF and transplant recipients (r = 0.36, P = 0.0006).

Patients with end-stage chronic organ failure may suffer daily from distressful physical and psychological symptoms. The objective of the present study is to systematically review studies that examined daily symptom prevalence in patients with end-stage chronic organ failure, with attention to those that included patients with either congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>). Thirty-nine articles (8 CHF, 7 COPD, 2 CHF and COPD, 22 CRF) have been included. The included studies used various study designs. There was a wide range of daily symptom prevalence that may be due to the heterogeneity in methodology used. Nevertheless, findings suggest significant symptom burden in these patients.

18797164,"Effect of exercise on cardiac tissue oxidative and inflammatory mediators in chronic kidney disease.BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>) results in diminished physical activity and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD risk factors are raised by sedentary life style and ameliorated by physical fitness in the general population. Accordingly, exercise improves hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in high-risk populations. This study was designed to explore the effect of exercise on oxidative and inflammatory mediators in the left ventricle (LV) of CRF rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: One week after 5/6 nephrectomy female rats were housed in either regular cages or cages equipped with running wheels for 4 weeks. Sham-operated rats housed in regular cages served as controls. Sedentary CRF rats exhibited azotemia, hypertension, anemia, oxidative stress, activation of NF-kappaB and upregulations of reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme, NAD(P)H oxidase, MCP-1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and PAI-1 in LV. The CRF rats assigned to the exercise group ran 6.8 +/- 0.7 km/day and 72 +/- 8 min/day. Voluntary exercise reversed NF-kappaB activation and lowered NAD(P)H oxidase, PAI-1, MCP-1 and COX-2 abundance, increased LV mass by raising myofibrillar proteins and ameliorated anemia without affecting renal function or arterial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: CRF resulted in upregulation of prooxidant/proinflammatory pathways in LV. These changes were ameliorated by exercise, which indicates the potential cardiovascular benefit of exercise in renal insufficiency.",M1

18756915,"Anthropological aspect of death in dialyzed patients.The aim of this article is to compare the incidence of thanatophobia in dialysed patients having Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) with a control group (N18) members where some of them have chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), but not (BEN). We examined thanatophobia on a sample of 753 dialysed patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) during the period from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2006. The first group is a cohort consisted of 348 patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), and the control group consisted of 405 randomly selected patients with different diagnoses of CRF (N18). The measurement instruments used were: General data list, Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Univariante and multivariante statistical analyses were carried out. From the multivariante analysis, the highest correlations with thanatophobia were found in these variables: avoidance of dialysis in BEN group: R=0.985, OR=0.358, CI=0.483-0.728 (95%), and in control group: R=0.550, OR=0.935, CI=0.615-0.830 (95%), age, years on dialysis, education, pervasive fear with statistical significance P=0.001. BEN group differentiates from control group: BAI-total (R=1.110, OR=0.578 (95%), CI=0.770-0.890, P=0.001), HDRS-total (R=0.995, OR=1.290 (95%), CI=1.180-1.920 P=0.001. BEN group have lower scores than the control group in MMSE-total: (R=0.430, OR=0.023 (95%), CI=0.034-2.850, P=0.001) which represents the organic part of anxiety. Thanatophobia is present in both groups, but it is more frequent in the BEN (11.70%) than in control group (7.50%). We found that thanatophobia occurs before dialysis, and that it is structured as a pervasive fear of death and is associated with endemia, years spent on dialysis, and avoidance of dialysis.",M1
18721740,"Feedback inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by dietary cholesterol in experimental chronic renal failure.OBJECTIVE: Enhanced liver cholesterol synthesis is present in experimental chronic renal failure (<e>CRF</e>), even though cholesterol concentrations in blood and liver are increased, suggesting that CRF results in disturbed cholesterolegenesis feedback regulation. DESIGN: This study sought to elucidate whether dietary cholesterol exerts inhibitory effects on liver cholesterologenesis in CRF rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used. Experimental CRF was achieved by a 5/6 nephrectomy model. Cholesterologenesis was measured (1) in vivo by tritiated water incorporation into cholesterol, and (2) in vitro (using liver slices) by [(14)C]-acetate and [(3)H]-mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol. In addition, the mRNA abundance of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterologenesis pathway, as well as its activity, was determined. Finally, the mRNA level of liver sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, a nuclear transcription factor engaged in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, was measured. RESULTS: Experimental CRF was associated with significantly increased concentrations of serum and liver cholesterol. In vitro and in vivo cholesterologenesis was enhanced in CRF rats. A cholesterol-enriched diet resulted in a significant decrease in (1) in vivo and in vitro cholesterol synthesis, (2) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene expression, and (3) the level of liver sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 mRNA in CRF rats. CONCLUSIONS: Despite elevated plasma and liver cholesterol concentrations, cholesterologenesis is increased in CRF rats. It is, however, inhibited by dietary cholesterol. These results suggest that a feedback inhibition of cholesterologenesis by dietary cholesterol is preserved in experimental CRF.",M1
20432720,"[Mechanisms of corticotropin-releasing factor-induced analgesic effect in conscious rats]The aim of study was to investigate a contribution of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and opioid system in corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)-induced analgesic effect in conscious rats during thermal stimulus. The contribution of HPA axis in CRF-induced analgesia was studied with two approaches: 1) pharmacological suppression of HPA axis activity induced by cortisol administration in pharmacological dose one week before experiment; 2) occupation of glucocorticoid receptors by its antagonist RU 38486. The opioid antagonist naltrexone was used to examine the involvement of opioid system in CRF-induced analgesia. Blockade of opioid receptors by its antagonist completely eliminated CRF-induced analgesic effect. Pharmacological suppression of HPA axis resulted in a decrease of CRF-induced analgesic effect, blockade of glucocorticoids receptors by RU-38486 potentiated CRF-induced analgesic effect. The data obtained suggest that CRF-induced analgesic effect is mediated by opioids. The effect ofopioids upon pain sensitivity may be modulated by glucocorticoid hormones.",M2
20383137,"<e>CRF</e> receptor 1 regulates anxiety behavior via sensitization of 5-HT2 receptor signaling.Stress and anxiety disorders are risk factors for depression and these behaviors are modulated by corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) and serotonin receptor (5-HT(2)R). However, the potential behavioral and cellular interaction between these two receptors is unclear. We found that pre-administration of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) into the prefrontal cortex of mice enhanced 5-HT(2)R-mediated anxiety behaviors in response to 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine. In both heterologous cell cultures and mouse cortical neurons, activation of CRFR1 also enhanced 5-HT(2) receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation. CRFR1-mediated increases in 5-HT(2)R signaling were dependent on receptor internalization and receptor recycling via rapid recycling endosomes, resulting in increased expression of 5-HT(2)R on the cell surface. Sensitization of 5-HT(2)R signaling by CRFR1 required intact PDZ domain-binding motifs at the end of the C-terminal tails of both receptor types. These data suggest a mechanism by which CRF, a peptide known to be released by stress, enhances anxiety-related behavior via sensitization of 5-HT(2)R signaling.",M2
20377617,"Dopamine receptor mechanisms mediate corticotropin-releasing factor-induced long-term potentiation in the rat amygdala following cocaine withdrawal.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in the amygdala is involved in stress responses. Moreover, dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain reward system including the amygdala plays a significant role in the pathology of cocaine addiction. The present study analysed CRF-induced synaptic plasticity, its pharmacological sensitivity and interactions with the dopamine (DA) system in the basolateral to lateral capsula central amygdala (lcCeA) pathway after a 2-week withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration. A physiologically relevant CRF concentration (25 nm) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) that was enhanced after cocaine withdrawal. In saline-treated rats, CRF-induced LTP was mediated through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) and CRF(1) receptors. However, in cocaine-withdrawn animals, activation of CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptors was found to enhance LTP. This enhanced CRF-induced LTP after cocaine withdrawal was mediated through endogenous activation of both D1- and D2-like receptors. Furthermore, expression of the D1 receptor (D1R) but not the D2R, D3R, D4R or D5R was significantly increased after cocaine withdrawal. CRF(1) but not CRF(2) protein expression was increased, suggesting that elevated levels of these proteins contributed to the enhancement of CRF-induced LTP during cocaine withdrawal. CRF interactions with the DA system in the amygdala may represent a fundamental neurochemical and cellular mechanism linking stress to cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity.",M2
20368512,"Association of polymorphisms in genes regulating the corticotropin-releasing factor system with antidepressant treatment response.CONTEXT: The corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>, or corticotropin-releasing hormone) and arginine vasopressin systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depressive disorders and response to antidepressant treatment. OBJECTIVE: To study the association of genetic variants in 10 genes that regulate the CRF and arginine vasopressin systems with treatment response to citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) sample (N = 1768). DESIGN: Pharmacogenetic association study derived from the STAR*D study, a multicenter, prospective, open, 12-week effectiveness trial. SETTING: Outpatient primary care and psychiatric clinics. Patients Individuals with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder for whom DNA was available who were subsequently treated with citalopram hydrobromide for 4 to 12 weeks. Intervention Flexible doses of citalopram. Main Outcome Measure Association of genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the CRF system with response and remission to citalopram treatment at exit visit. RESULTS: One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs10473984) within the CRHBP locus showed a significant association with both remission (P = 6.0 x 10(-6); corrected, P = .0026) and reduction in depressive symptoms (P = 7.0 x 10(-7); corrected, P = .00031) in response to citalopram. The T allele of this SNP was associated with poorer treatment outcome in 2 of the 3 ethnic subsamples (African American and Hispanic), despite large differences in minor allele frequency. This association was more pronounced in patients with features of anxious depression (P = .008). The nonresponse allele was shown to be associated with overall higher plasma corticotropin levels and more pronounced dexamethasone suppression of corticotropin. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a genetic variant within the CRHBP locus affects response to citalopram in African American and Hispanic patients, suggesting a role for this gene and for the CRF system in antidepressant treatment response.",M2
20234885,"Emerging role of alternative splicing of CRF1 receptor in <e>CRF</e> signaling.Alternative splicing of mRNA is one of the most important mechanisms responsible for an increase of the genomic capacity. Thus the majority of human proteins including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possess several isoforms as a result of mRNA splicing. The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptors are the most proximal elements of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) - the central machinery of stress response. Moreover, expression of CRF and regulated activity of CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1) can also play an important role in regulation of local stress response in peripheral tissues including skin, gastrointestinal tract or reproductive system. In humans, expression of at least eight variants of CRF1 mRNA (alpha, beta, c, d, e, f, g and h) was detected and alternative splicing was found to be regulated by diverse physiological and pathological factors including: growth conditions, onset of labor, during pregnancy or exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. The pattern of expression of CRF1 isoforms is cell type specific and recently has been linked to observed differences in responsiveness to CRF stimulation. In the proposed model of regulation of CRF-signaling, isoform CRF1alpha plays a central role. Other isoforms modulate its activity by oligomerization, leading to alteration in receptor trafficking, localization and function. Co-expression of CRF1 isoforms modulates sensitivity of cells to the ligands and influences downstream coupling to G-proteins. The other possible regulatory mechanisms include fast mRNA and/or protein turnover or decoy receptor function of CRF1 isoforms. Taken together, alternative splicing of CRF1 can represent another level of regulation of CRF-mediated stress responses at the central and peripheral levels. Chronic stress or malfunction of the HPA-axis have been linked to numerous human pathologies, suggesting that alternative splicing of CRF1 receptor could represent a promising target for drugs development.",M2
20206287,"Progress in corticotropin-releasing factor-1 antagonist development.Corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptor antagonists have been sought since the stress-secreted peptide was isolated in 1981. Although evidence is mixed concerning the efficacy of CRF(1) antagonists as antidepressants, CRF(1) antagonists might be novel pharmacotherapies for anxiety and addiction. Progress in understanding the two-domain model of ligand-receptor interactions for CRF family receptors might yield chemically novel CRF(1) receptor antagonists, including peptide CRF(1) antagonists, antagonists with signal transduction selectivity and nonpeptide CRF(1) antagonists that act via the extracellular (rather than transmembrane) domains. Novel ligands that conform to the prevalent pharmacophore and exhibit drug-like pharmacokinetic properties have been identified. The therapeutic utility of CRF(1) antagonists should soon be clearer: several small molecules are currently in Phase II/III clinical trials for depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome.",M2
20201818,"Pre-clinical evidence that corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptor antagonists are promising targets for pharmacological treatment of alcoholism.Alcoholism is a chronic disorder characterized by cycling periods of excessive ethanol consumption, withdrawal, abstinence and relapse, which is associated with progressive changes in central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor signaling. CRF and urocortin peptides act by binding to the CRF type 1 (CRF1R) or the CRF type 2 (CRF2R) receptors, both of which have been implicated in the regulation of neurobiological responses to ethanol. The current review provides a comprehensive overview of preclinical evidence from studies involving rodents that when viewed together, suggest a promising role for CRFR antagonists in the treatment of alcohol abuse disorders. CRFR antagonists protect against excessive ethanol intake resulting from ethanol dependence without influencing ethanol intake in non-dependent animals. Similarly, CRFR antagonists block excessive binge-like ethanol drinking in non-dependent mice but do not alter ethanol intake in mice drinking moderate amounts of ethanol. CRFR antagonists also protect against increased ethanol intake and relapse-like behaviors precipitated by exposure to a stressful event. Additionally, CRFR antagonists attenuate the negative emotional responses associated with ethanol withdrawal. The protective effects of CRFR antagonists are modulated by CRF1R. Finally, recent evidence has emerged suggesting that CRF2R agonists may also be useful for treating alcohol abuse disorders.",M2
20160137,"Individual differences in reactivity to social stress predict susceptibility and resilience to a depressive phenotype: role of corticotropin-releasing factor.Previous social stress exposure is a common risk factor for affective disorders. However, factors that determine vulnerability or resiliency to social stress-induced psychopathologies remain unclear. Using a rodent model of social stress, the present study was designed to identify putative neurobiological substrates that contribute to social stress-induced psychopathology and factors that influence or predict vulnerability. The resident-intruder model of defeat was used as a social stressor in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The average latency to assume a subordinate posture (signaling defeat) over seven daily defeat exposures was calculated and examined with respect to endpoints of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity, components of the corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system, and behaviors that are relevant to human depression. In the present studies, a bimodal distribution emerged in an otherwise homogeneous population of Sprague Dawley rats such that 42% of rats exhibited short defeat latencies (&lt;300 sec), whereas 58% of rats resisted defeat and exhibited longer latencies (&gt;300 sec). These two phenotypes were associated with distinct endocrine and behavioral profiles as well as differences in components of the CRF system. Notably, the short-latency subpopulation exhibited hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation and behavior similar to that observed in melancholic depression. Examination of components of the CRF system suggested that proactive behavior in resisting defeat exhibited by long-latency rats was associated with decreased efficacy of CRF. Together, these data suggest that inherent differences in stress reactivity, perhaps as a result of differences in CRF regulation, may predict long-term consequences of social stress and vulnerability to depressive-like symptoms.",M2
20147556,"Hypocretins regulate the anxiogenic-like effects of nicotine and induce reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior.Emerging evidence suggests that the hypocretinergic system is involved in addictive behavior. In this study, we investigated the role of these hypothalamic neuropeptides in anxiety-like responses of nicotine and stress-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior. Acute nicotine (0.8 mg/kg, s.c.) induced anxiogenic-like effects in the elevated plus-maze and activated the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) as revealed by c-Fos expression. Pretreatment with the hypocretin receptor 1 (Hcrtr-1) antagonist SB334867 or preprohypocretin gene deletion blocked both nicotine effects. In the PVN, SB334867 also prevented the activation of corticotrophin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) neurons, which expressed Hcrtr-1. In addition, an increase of the percentage of c-Fos-positive hypocretin cells in the perifornical and dorsomedial hypothalamic (PFA/DMH) areas was found after nicotine (0.8 mg/kg, s.c.) administration. Intracerebroventricular infusion of hypocretin-1 (Hcrt-1) (0.75 nmol/1 mul) or footshock stress reinstated a previously extinguished nicotine-seeking behavior. The effects of Hcrt-1 were blocked by SB334867, but not by the CRF1 receptor antagonist antalarmin. Moreover, SB334867 did not block CRF-dependent footshock-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking while antalarmin was effective in preventing this nicotine motivational response. Therefore, the Hcrt system interacts with CRF and AVP neurons in the PVN and modulates the anxiogenic-like effects of nicotine whereas Hcrt and CRF play a different role in the reinstatement of nicotine-seeking. Indeed, Hcrt-1 reinstates nicotine-seeking through a mechanism independent of CRF activation whereas CRF mediates the reinstatement induced by stress.",M2
20143250,"The corticotropin releasing factor system in cancer: expression and pathophysiological implications.Malignant tumors express multiple factors that have some role in the regulating networks supporting their ectopic growth.

In the present article, we review the literature suggesting that the CRF system could be involved in the regulation of human cancer development. Potential implication in growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, or immune parameters via activation of locally expressed receptors could be clinically exploited by presenting targets of new therapeutic approaches.",M2
20132869,"Mice overexpressing corticotropin-releasing factor show brain atrophy and motor dysfunctions.Chronic stress and persistently high glucocorticoid levels can induce brain atrophy. Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)-overexpressing (OE) mice are a genetic model of chronic stress with elevated brain CRF and plasma corticosterone levels and Cushing's syndrome. The brain structural alterations in the CRF-OE mice, however, are not well known. We found that adult male and female CRF-OE mice had significantly lower whole brain and cerebellum weights than their wild type (WT) littermates (347.7+/-3.6mg vs. 460.1+/-4.3mg and 36.3+/-0.8mg vs. 50.0+/-1.3mg, respectively) without sex-related difference. The epididymal/parametrial fat mass was significantly higher in CRF-OE mice. The brain weight was inversely correlated to epididymal/parametrial fat weight, but not to body weight. Computerized image analysis system in Nissl-stained brain sections of female mice showed that the anterior cingulate and sensorimotor cortexes of CRF-OE mice were significantly thinner, and the volumes of the hippocampus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and amygdala were significantly reduced compared to WT, while the locus coeruleus showed a non-significant increase. Motor functions determined by beam crossing and gait analysis showed that CRF-OE mice took longer time and more steps to traverse a beam with more errors, and displayed reduced stride length compared to their WT littermates. These data show that CRF-OE mice display brain size reduction associated with alterations of motor coordination and an increase in visceral fat mass providing a novel animal model to study mechanisms involved in brain atrophy under conditions of sustained elevation of brain CRF and circulating glucocorticoid levels.",M2
20132811,"Corticotropin-releasing factor receptors and urocortins, links between the brain and the heart.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), a 41 amino acid peptide, was discovered as a key signal in mediating neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress. It was revealed later that there exist additional CRF-like peptides, termed urocortins. The CRF receptor subtype 1 (CRF1 receptor) is predominant in the brain whereas subtype 2 (CRF2 receptor) is highly expressed in the brain and the heart. Both centrally and peripherally administered CRF and urocortins produce significant hemodynamic effects via activation of CRF receptors in the brain and the heart. CRF and urocortins are important neural and cardioactive hormones, and are potentially useful therapy for heart failure.",M2
20130533,"<e>CRF</e>-1 antagonist and CRF-2 agonist decrease binge-like ethanol drinking in C57BL/6J mice independent of the HPA axis.Recent evidence suggests that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor (CRFR) signaling is involved in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption in C57BL/6J mice. In this report, a series of experiments were performed to further characterize the role of CRFR signaling in binge-like ethanol consumption. The role of central CRFR signaling was assessed with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of the nonselective CRFR antagonist, alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (0, 1, 5, 10 microg/1 microl). The contribution of central CRF type 2 receptor (CRF(2)R) signaling was assessed with i.c.v. infusion of the selective CRF(2)R agonist, urocortin (Ucn) 3 (0, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 microg/1 microl). The role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was assessed by pretreating mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of (1) the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone (0, 50, 100, 150 mg/kg) or (2) the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone (0, 25, 50 mg/kg), and (3) by using radioimmunoassay to determine whether binge-like ethanol intake influenced plasma corticosterone levels. Finally, we determined whether the ability of the CRF(1)R antagonist, CP-154,526 (CP; 0, 10, 15 mg/kg, i.p.), to blunt binge-like drinking required normal HPA axis signaling by comparing the effectiveness of CP in adrenalectomized (ADX) and normal mice. Results showed that i.c.v. infusion of a 1 microg dose of alpha-helical CRF(9-41) significantly attenuated binge-like ethanol consumption relative to vehicle treatment, and i.c.v. infusion of Ucn 3 dose-dependently blunted binge-like drinking. On the other hand, metyrapone nonselectively reduced both ethanol and sucrose consumption, mifepristone did not alter ethanol drinking, and binge-like drinking did not correlate with plasma corticosterone levels. Finally, i.p. injection of CP significantly attenuated binge-like ethanol intake in both ADX and normal mice. Together, these results suggest that binge-like ethanol intake in C57BL/6J mice is modulated by CRF(1)R and CRF(2)R signaling, such that blockade of CRF(1)R or activation of CRF(2)R effectively reduces excessive ethanol intake. Furthermore, normal HPA axis signaling is not necessary to achieve binge-like drinking behavior.",M2
20109547,"A corticotropin-releasing factor system expressed in the cochlea modulates hearing sensitivity and protects against noise-induced hearing loss.Noise-induced hearing loss is a highly prevalent occupational injury, yet little is known concerning the signals controlling normal cochlear sensitivity and susceptibility to noise-induced trauma. While the corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system is involved in activation of the classic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, it is also involved in local physiological responses to stress in many tissues, and is expressed in the inner ear. We demonstrate that mice lacking the CRF receptor CRFR2 exhibit a significantly lower auditory threshold than wild type mice, but this gain of function comes at the price of increased susceptibility to acoustic trauma. We further demonstrate that glutamatergic transmission, purinergic signaling, and activation of Akt (PKB) pathways within the cochlea are misregulated, which may underlie the enhanced sensitivity and trauma susceptibility observed in CRFR2(-/-) mice. Our data suggest that CRFR2 constitutively modulates hearing sensitivity under normal conditions, and thereby provides protection against noise-induced hearing loss.",M2
20096320,"Alterations in colonic corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in the maternally separated rat model of irritable bowel syndrome: differential effects of acute psychological and physical stressors.Early-life stress is a key predisposing factor to the development of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Thus, changes in stress-related molecular substrates which influence colonic function may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of such disorders. Activation of peripheral corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptors is thought to be important in the maintenance of GI function homeostasis. Therefore, immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques were utilized to investigate colonic expression of CRF receptors in the maternal separation (MS) model as compared to non-separated (NS) rats. Receptor expression was also assessed following exposure to two different acute stressors, the open field (OF) and colorectal distension (CRD). Immunofluorescent dual-labeling demonstrated increased activation of both CRFR1 (MS: 79.6+/-4.4% vs. NS: 43.8+/-6.8%, p&lt;0.001) and CRFR2 (MS: 65.9+/-3.2% vs. NS: 51.6+/-5.8%, p&lt;0.05) positive cells in MS rats. Protein expression of CRFR1 and CRFR2 in the proximal colon was similar under baseline conditions and not affected by exposure to an OF stressor in either cohort. In contrast, distal CRFR1 and CRFR2 levels were higher in MS rats but were significantly reduced post OF stress. Moreover, decreases in expression of CRFR1 in the proximal and distal colon of NS rats following exposure to CRD were blunted in MS rats. CRD also caused an increase in the functional isoform of CRFR2 in the distal colon of MS rats with no effect in NS colons. This study demonstrates that acute stressors alter colonic CRF receptor expression in a manner that is determined by the underlying stress sensitivity of the subject.",M2
20085787,"Long-term losses of amygdala corticotropin-releasing factor neurons are associated with behavioural outcomes following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.Neuronal losses are observed in the brain after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) however few studies have examined the effects of HI on specific neuronal phenotypes and their possible contribution to behavioural outcomes. In the present study we examined whether postnatal day 3 (P3) HI alters numbers of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the amygdala, 1 (P10) and 6 (P45) weeks after P3 HI. A significant reduction in the number of CRF-positive neurons in the PVN, central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and BNST ipsilateral to the carotid ligation 1 and 6 weeks after P3 HI was observed. There was also a significant reduction in the number of NPY-positive neurons in the PVN, amygdala and BNST ipsilateral to the carotid ligation 1 week after P3 HI. However after 6 weeks, only the number of PVN NPY-positive neurons decreased significantly. At 6 weeks post-insult, the number of CeA CRF-positive neurons was inversely associated with locomotor activity and exploratory behaviour in an open field. In contrast, no significant correlations between neuronal counts and early neurodevelopment tests performed on P10 were observed. Thus after P3 HI persistent losses of CRF- and NPY-positive neurons occur and the loss of CeA CRF neurons may provide a central anatomical mechanism underlying neurobehavioural deficits observed 6 weeks after P3 HI.",M2
20072117,"The serotonergic projection from the median raphe nucleus to the ventral hippocampus is involved in the retrieval of fear memory through the corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 receptor.Several different studies have separately established that serotonin, corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptors, and the hippocampus are involved in fear memory retrieval. The main aim of this study is to connect these separate studies. To assess the levels of anxiety/fear, we used the contextual fear-conditioning test and the elevated plus maze test as memory-dependent and memory-independent tasks, respectively. We injected CRF receptor antagonists or vehicle into the median raphe nucleus (MRN) 10 min before behavioral tests. As a result, 1000 ng of astressin 2B (CRF(2) receptor antagonist), but not 250 ng of antalarmin (CRF(1) receptor antagonist), significantly suppressed the expression rate of freezing behavior in the contextual fear-conditioning test. However, in the elevated plus maze test, there was no difference between astressin 2B-injected rats and saline-injected rats in the time spent in open arms. Neither the amount of exploratory behavior nor the moving distance in the EPM of astressin 2B-injected rats differed from that of vehicle-injected rats. Moreover, when we assessed the extracellular serotonin release in the ventral hippocampus in freely moving rats through in vivo microdialysis, it was shown that the blockade of the CRF(2) receptor in the MRN suppressed serotonin release in the ventral hippocampus during fear memory retrieval. These results indicated that endogenous CRF and/or related ligands that were released in the MRN could activate the CRF(2) receptor and stimulate serotonin release in the ventral hippocampus, thereby inducing fear memory retrieval.",M2
20060104,"Corticotropin releasing factor-induced amygdala gamma-aminobutyric Acid release plays a key role in alcohol dependence.BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems in the central amygdala (CeA) are implicated in the high-anxiety, high-drinking profile associated with ethanol dependence. Ethanol augments CeA GABA release in ethanol-naive rats and mice. METHODS: Using naive and ethanol-dependent rats, we compared electrophysiologic effects and interactions of CRF and ethanol on CeA GABAergic transmission, and we measured GABA dialyzate in CeA after injection of CRF(1) antagonists and ethanol. We also compared mRNA expression in CeA for CRF and CRF(1) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We assessed effects of chronic treatment with a CRF(1) antagonist on withdrawal-induced increases in alcohol consumption in dependent rats. RESULTS: CRF and ethanol augmented CeA GABAergic transmission in naive rats via increased GABA release. Three CRF1 receptor (CRF(1)) antagonists decreased basal GABAergic responses and abolished ethanol effects. Ethanol-dependent rats exhibited heightened sensitivity to CRF and CRF(1) antagonists on CeA GABA release. Intra-CeA CRF(1) antagonist administration reversed dependence-related elevations in GABA dialysate and blocked ethanol-induced increases in GABA dialyzate in both dependent and naive rats. Polymerase chain reaction studies indicate increased expression of CRF and CRF(1) in CeA of dependent rats. Chronic CRF(1) antagonist treatment blocked withdrawal-induced increases in alcohol drinking by dependent rats and tempered moderate increases in alcohol consumption by nondependent rats in intermittent testing. CONCLUSIONS: These combined findings suggest a key role for specific presynaptic CRF-GABA interactions in CeA in the development and maintenance of ethanol dependence.",M2
20052275,"CRF1-R activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid system in the mouse basolateral amygdala mediates anxiety-like behavior.Stress is a complex human experience and having both rewarding and aversive motivational properties. The adverse effects of stress are well documented, yet many of underlying mechanisms remain unclear and controversial. Here we report that the anxiogenic properties of stress are encoded by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin acting in the basolateral amygdala. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that the anxiogenic-like effects of Corticotropin Releasing Factor (<e>CRF</e>) were triggered by CRF(1)-R activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system. Central CRF administration significantly reduced the percent open-arm time in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The reduction in open-arm time was blocked by pretreatment with the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), and was not evident in mice lacking the endogenous KOR ligand dynorphin. The CRF(1)-R agonist stressin 1 also significantly reduced open-arm time in the EPM, and this decrease was blocked by norBNI. In contrast, the selective CRF(2)-R agonist urocortin III did not affect open arm time, and mice lacking CRF(2)-R still showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior in response to CRF injection. However, CRF(2)-R knockout animals did not develop CRF conditioned place aversion, suggesting that CRF(1)-R activation may mediate anxiety and CRF(2)-R may encode aversion. Using a phosphoselective antibody (KORp) to identify sites of dynorphin action, we found that CRF increased KORp-immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of wildtype, but not in mice pretreated with the selective CRF(1)-R antagonist, antalarmin. Consistent with the concept that acute stress or CRF injection-induced anxiety was mediated by dynorphin release in the BLA, local injection of norBNI blocked the stress or CRF-induced increase in anxiety-like behavior; whereas norBNI injection in a nearby thalamic nucleus did not. The intersection of stress-induced CRF and the dynorphin/KOR system in the BLA was surprising, and these results suggest that CRF and dynorphin/KOR systems may coordinate stress-induced anxiety behaviors and aversive behaviors via different mechanisms.",M2
20026211,"Behavioral effects of neuropeptides in rodent models of depression and anxiety.In recent years, studies have advocated neuropeptide systems as modulators for the behavioral states found in mood disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders. Neuropeptides have been tested in traditional animal models and screening procedures that have been validated by known antidepressants and anxiolytics. However, it has become clear that although these tests are very useful, neuropeptides have distinct behavioral effects and dose-dependent characteristics, and therefore, use of these tests with neuropeptides must be done with an understanding of their unique characteristics. This review will focus on the behavioral actions of neuropeptides and their synthetic analogs, particularly in studies utilizing various preclinical tests of depression and anxiety. Specifically, the following neuropeptide systems will be reviewed: corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), urocortin (Ucn), teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin, the Tyr-MIF-1 family, cholecystokinin (CCK), galanin, and substance P. These neuropeptide systems each have a unique role in the regulation of stress-like behavior, and therefore provide intriguing therapeutic targets for mood disorder treatment.",M2
20026088,"Role of innate and drug-induced dysregulation of brain stress and arousal systems in addiction: Focus on corticotropin-releasing factor, nociceptin/orphanin FQ, and orexin/hypocretin.Stress-like symptoms are an integral part of acute and protracted drug withdrawal, and several lines of evidence have shown that dysregulation of brain stress systems, including the extrahypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system, following long-term drug use is of major importance in maintaining drug and alcohol addiction. Recently, two other neuropeptide systems have attracted interest, the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and orexin/hypocretin (Orx/Hcrt) systems. N/OFQ participates in a wide range of physiological responses, and the hypothalamic Orx/Hcrt system helps regulate several physiological processes, including feeding, energy metabolism, and arousal. Moreover, these two systems have been suggested to participate in psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and drug addiction. Dysregulation of these systems by chronic drug exposure has been hypothesized to play a role in the maintenance of addiction and dependence. Recent evidence demonstrated that interactions between CRF-N/OFQ and CRF-Orx/Hcrt systems may be functionally relevant for the control of stress-related addictive behavior. The present review discusses recent findings that support the hypotheses of the participation and dysregulation of these systems in drug addiction and evaluates the current understanding of interactions among these stress-regulatory peptides.",M2
19968991,"Brainstem reticulospinal neurons are targets for corticotropin-releasing factor-Induced locomotion in roughskin newts.Stress-induced release or central administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) enhances locomotion in a wide range of vertebrates, including the roughskin newt, Taricha granulosa. Although CRF's stimulatory actions on locomotor behavior are well established, the target neurons through which CRF exerts this effect remain unknown. To identify these target neurons, we utilized a fluorescent conjugate of CRF (CRF-TAMRA 1) to track this peptide's internalization into reticulospinal and other neurons in the medullary reticular formation (MRF), a region critically involved in regulating locomotion. Epifluorescent and confocal microscopy revealed that CRF-TAMRA 1 was internalized by diverse MRF neurons, including reticulospinal neurons retrogradely labeled with Cascade Blue dextran. In addition, we immunohistochemically identified a distinct subset of serotonin-containing neurons, located throughout the medullary raphé, that also internalized the fluorescent CRF-TAMRA 1 conjugate. Chronic single-unit recordings obtained from microwire electrodes in behaving newts revealed that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of CRF-TAMRA 1 increased medullary neuronal firing and that appearance of this firing was associated with, and strongly predictive of, episodes of CRF-induced locomotion. Furthermore, icv administered CRF-TAMRA 1 produced behavioral and neurophysiological effects identical to equimolar doses of unlabeled CRF. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that CRF directly targets reticulospinal and serotonergic neurons in the MRF and indicate that CRF may enhance locomotion via direct effects on the hindbrain, including the reticulospinal system.",M2
19944726,"Corticotropin releasing factor in the rat colon: expression, localization and upregulation by endotoxin.Little is known about <e>CRF</e> expression and regulation in the rat colon compared to the brain. We investigated CRF gene expression, cellular location, and regulation by endotoxin and corticosterone in the male rat colon at 6h after intraperitoneal (ip) injection. CRF mRNA level, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was 1.3-fold higher in the distal than proximal colon and 3.4-fold higher in the proximal colonic submucosa plus muscle layers than in mucosa. CRF immunoreactivity was located in the epithelia, lamina propria and crypts, and co-localized with tryptophan hydroxylase, a marker for enterochromaffin (EC) cells, and in enteric neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 microg/kg, ip) increased defecation by 2.9-fold and upregulated CRF mRNA by 2.5-fold in the proximal and 1.1-fold in the distal colon while there was no change induced by corticosterone as monitored by quantitative PCR. LPS-induced increased CRF mRNA expression occurred in the submucosa plus muscle layers (1.5-fold) and the mucosa of proximal colon (0.9-fold). LPS increased significantly CRF immunoreactivity in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of proximal and distal colon compared to saline groups. These results indicate that in rats, CRF is expressed in both proximal and distal colon and more prominently in enteric neurons of the submucosa plus muscle layers and subject to upregulation at the gene and protein levels by LPS through corticosteroid independent pathways. These data suggests that colonic CRF may be part of the local effector limb of the CRF(1) receptor mediated colonic alterations induced by acute stress.",M2
19926814,"Early weaning stress impairs development of mucosal barrier function in the porcine intestine.Early life stress is a predisposing factor for the development of chronic intestinal disorders in adult life. Here, we show that stress associated with early weaning in pigs leads to impaired mucosal barrier function. Early weaning (15- to 21-day weaning age) resulted in sustained impairment in intestinal barrier function, as indicated by reductions in jejunal transepithelial electrical resistance and elevations in mucosal-to-serosal flux of paracellular probes [(3)H]mannitol and [(14)C]inulin measured at 5 and 9 wk of age, compared with that shown in late-weaned pigs (23- to 28-day weaning age). Elevated baseline short-circuit current was observed in jejunum from early-weaned pigs and was shown to be mediated via enhanced Cl(-) secretion. Jejunal barrier dysfunction in early-weaned pigs coincided with increased lamina propria immune cell density particularly mucosal mast cells. The mast cell stabilizer drug sodium cromoglycolate ameliorated barrier dysfunction and hypersecretion in early-weaned pigs, demonstrating an important role of mast cells. Furthermore, activation of mast cells ex vivo with c48/80 and corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in pig jejunum mounted in Ussing chambers induced barrier dysfunction and elevations in short-circuit current that were inhibited with mast cell protease inhibitors. Experiments in which selective CRF receptor antagonists were administered to early-weaned pigs revealed that CRF receptor 1 (CRFr1) activation mediates barrier dysfunction and hypersecretion, whereas CRFr2 activation may be responsible for novel protective properties in the porcine intestine in response to early life stress.",M2
19914260,"Corticotropin releasing factor and neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction.Corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), one of the major effectors of stress, plays a major role in the natural course of drug addiction by accelerating the acquisition of psychostimulant self-administration and increasing incentive motivation for the drug itself and for drug-associated stimuli. Stress-induced CRF is also considered a predictor of relapse and is responsible for feelings of anxiety and distress during cocaine withdrawal. Despite this knowledge, the role of CRF has not been explored in the context of recent research on reward-related learning, built on the hypothesis that neuroplastic changes in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry underlie addiction. The present review explores the effects of stress on the pattern of interaction between CRF, dopamine and glutamate in distinct structures of the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), after acute and chronic cocaine consumption as well as in early withdrawal and protracted abstinence. A better knowledge of the neurochemical and cellular mechanisms involved in these interactions would be useful to elucidate the role of CRF in cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity, which could be useful in developing new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of cocaine addiction.",M2
19913194,"Neurobiological mechanisms contributing to alcohol-stress-anxiety interactions.This article summarizes the proceedings of a symposium that was presented at a conference entitled  Alcoholism and Stress: A Framework for Future Treatment Strategies.  The conference was held in Volterra, Italy on May 6-9, 2008 and this symposium was chaired by Jeff L. Weiner. The overall goal of this session was to review recent findings that may shed new light on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the complex relationships between stress, anxiety, and alcoholism. Dr. Danny Winder described a novel interaction between D1 receptor activation and the corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system that leads to an increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Dr. Marisa Roberto presented recent data describing how protein kinase C epsilon, ethanol, and CRF interact to alter GABAergic inhibition in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Dr. Jeff Weiner presented recent advances in our understanding of inhibitory circuitry within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and how acute ethanol exposure enhances GABAergic inhibition in these pathways. Finally, Dr. Brian McCool discussed recent findings on complementary glutamatergic and GABAergic adaptations to chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal in the BLA. Collectively, these investigators have identified novel mechanisms through which neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems interact to modulate synaptic activity in stress and anxiety circuits. Their studies have also begun to describe how acute and chronic ethanol exposure influence excitatory and inhibitory synaptic communication in these pathways. These findings point toward a number of novel neurobiological targets that may prove useful for the development of more effective treatment strategies for alcohol use disorders.",M2
19912996,"The role of <e>CRF</e> and CRF-related peptides in the dark side of addiction.Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by a compulsion to seek and take drugs, the development of dependence, and the manifestation of a negative emotional state when the drug is removed. Activation of brain stress systems is hypothesized to be a key element of the negative emotional state produced by dependence that drives drug-seeking through negative reinforcement mechanisms, defined as the  dark side  of addiction. The focus of the present review is on the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and CRF-related peptides in the dark side of addiction. CRF is a key mediator of the hormonal, autonomic, and behavior responses to stressors. Emphasis is placed on the role of CRF in extrahypothalamic systems in the extended amygdala, including the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and a transition area in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, in the dark side of addiction. The urocortin/CRF(2) systems have been less explored, but results suggest their role in the neuroadaptation associated with chronic drug use, sometimes in opposition to the effects produced by the CRF(1) receptor. Compelling evidence argues that the CRF stress system, including its activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, plays a key role in engaging the transition to dependence and maintaining dependence once it is initiated. Understanding the role of the CRF systems in addiction not only provides insight into the neurobiology of the dark side of addiction, but also provides novel targets for identifying vulnerability to addiction and the treatment of addiction.",M2
19901333,"<e>CRF</e> system recruitment mediates dark side of compulsive eating.Dieting to control body weight involves cycles of deprivation from palatable food that can promote compulsive eating. The present study shows that rats withdrawn from intermittent access to palatable food exhibit overeating of palatable food upon renewed access and an affective withdrawal-like state characterized by corticotropin-releasing factor-1 (CRF(1)) receptor antagonist-reversible behaviors, including hypophagia, motivational deficits to obtain less palatable food, and anxiogenic-like behavior. Withdrawal was accompanied by increased CRF expression and CRF(1) electrophysiological responsiveness in the central nucleus of the amygdala. We propose that recruitment of anti-reward extrahypothalamic CRF-CRF(1) systems during withdrawal from palatable food, analogous to abstinence from abused drugs, may promote compulsive selection of palatable food, undereating of healthier alternatives, and a negative emotional state when intake of palatable food is prevented.",M2
19900417,"Molecular and genetic substrates linking stress and addiction.Drug addiction is one of the top three health concerns in the United States in terms of economic and health care costs. Despite this, there are very few effective treatment options available. Therefore, understanding the causes and molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from casual drug use to compulsive drug addiction could aid in the development of treatment options. Studies in humans and animal models indicate that stress can lead to both vulnerability to develop addiction, and increased drug taking and relapse in addicted individuals. Exposure to stress or drugs of abuse results in long-term adaptations in the brain that are likely to involve persistent alterations in gene expression or activation of transcription factors, such as the cAMP Response Element Binding (CREB) protein. The signaling pathways controlled by CREB have been strongly implicated in drug addiction and stress. Many potential CREB target genes have been identified based on the presence of a CRE element in promoter DNA sequences. These include, but are not limited to <e>CRF</e>, BDNF, and dynorphin. These genes have been associated with initiation or reinstatement of drug reward and are altered in one direction or the other following stress. While many reviews have examined the interactions between stress and addiction, the goal of this review was to focus on specific molecules that play key roles in both stress and addiction and are therefore posed to mediate the interaction between the two. Focus on these molecules could provide us with new targets for pharmacological treatments for addiction.",M2
19891960,"Convergent actions of orexin/hypocretin and <e>CRF</e> on dopamine neurons: Emerging players in addiction.The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a brain region centrally involved in the development and expression of a variety of behaviors associated with drug use. Orexin/hypocretin (ox/hcrt) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) are both peptides released into the VTA, and an increasing number of studies show that both ox/hcrt and CRF in the VTA exert powerful modulatory effects on a variety of behaviors produced by drugs of abuse. Importantly, at a cellular and synaptic level, there is strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that these neuropeptides exert similar effects onto N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) expressed in VTA neurons, suggesting a common molecular target in the actions of these peptides on this circuitry and ultimately on behaviors associated with drug use. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence that ox/hcrt and CRF directly target dopamine neurons by modulating excitatory synaptic activity, and that interaction of ox/hcrt and CRF may play a central role in addictive behaviors. Understanding these interactions in more detail may suggest new therapeutic targets in the treatment of relapse to substance abuse.",M2
19889866,"Central oxytocin is involved in restoring impaired gastric motility following chronic repeated stress in mice.Accumulation of continuous life stress (chronic stress) often causes gastric symptoms. The development of gastric symptoms may depend on how humans adapt to the stressful events in their daily lives. Although acute stress delays gastric emptying and alters upper gastrointestinal motility in rodents, the effects of chronic stress on gastric motility and its adaptation mechanism remains unclear. Central oxytocin has been shown to have antistress effects. We studied whether central oxytocin is involved in mediating the adaptation mechanism following chronic repeated stress. Mice were loaded with acute and chronic stress (repeated stress for five consecutive days), and solid gastric emptying and postprandial gastric motility were compared between acute and chronic repeated stress. Expression of oxytocin and <e>CRF</e> mRNA in the hypothalamus was studied following acute and chronic repeated stress. Delayed gastric emptying during acute stress (43.1 +/- 7.8%; n = 6, P &lt; 0.05) was completely restored to normal levels (72.1 +/- 2.4%; n = 6) following chronic repeated stress. Impaired gastric motility induced by acute stress was also restored following chronic repeated stress. Intracerebroventricular injection of oxytocin (0.1 and 0.5 microg) restored the impaired gastric emptying and motility induced by acute stress. The restored gastric emptying and motility following chronic repeated stress were antagonized by intracerebroventricular injection of oxytocin antagonists. Oxytocin mRNA expression in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus was significantly increased following chronic repeated stress. In contrast, increased CRF mRNA expression in the SON and PVN in response to acute stress was significantly reduced following chronic repeated stress. Our study suggests the novel finding that the upregulation of central oxytocin expression is involved in mediating the adaptation mechanism following chronic repeated stress in mice.",M2
19879859,"Angiotensin II and <e>CRF</e> receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala mediate hemodynamic response variability to cocaine in conscious rats.Stress or cocaine evokes either a large increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) or a smaller increase in SVR accompanied by an increase in cardiac output (designated vascular and mixed responders, respectively) in Sprague-Dawley rats. We hypothesized that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) mediates this variability. Conscious, freely-moving rats, instrumented for measurement of arterial pressure and cardiac output and for drug delivery into the CeA, were given cocaine (5 mg/kg, iv, 4-6 times) and characterized as vascular (n=15) or mixed responders (n=10). Subsequently, we administered cocaine after bilateral microinjections (100 nl) of saline or selective agents in the CeA. Muscimol (80 pmol), a GABA(A) agonist, or losartan (43.4 pmol), an AT(1) receptor antagonist, attenuated the cocaine-induced increase in SVR in vascular responders, selectively, such that vascular responders were no longer different from mixed responders. The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) antagonist, alpha-helical CRF(9-41) (15.7 pmol), abolished the difference between cardiac output and SVR in mixed and vascular responders. We conclude that greater increases in SVR observed in vascular responders are dependent on AT(1) receptor activation and, to a lesser extent on CRF receptors. Therefore, AT(1) and CRF receptors in the CeA contribute to hemodynamic response variability to intravenous cocaine.",M2
19850009,"Comparison of the anorexigenic activity of <e>CRF</e> family peptides.Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) family peptides have an important role in the control of food intake.

Of the CRF family peptides, including CRF, urocortin1 (Ucn1), urocortin2 (Ucn2) and urocortin3 (Ucn3), peripherally administered Ucn1 was shown to have the most potent inhibitory effect on the food intake and body weight gain of both lean and high fat fed obese mice. In addition, repeated administration of Ucn1 lowered blood glucose and acylated ghrelin, and decreased the visceral fat weight of high fat fed obese mice.",M2
19843974,"Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) sensitization of ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior is brain site specific and mediated by CRF-1 receptors: relation to stress-induced sensitization.In abstinent alcoholics, stress induces negative affect-a response linked to craving and relapse. In rats, repeated stresses at weekly intervals before 5-day ethanol diet sensitize withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior ( anxiety ) that is blocked by a corticotrophin-releasing factor 1 (CRF-1)-receptor antagonist. Current experiments were performed to identify brain sites that support CRF involvement in stress sensitization of ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. First, different doses of CRF microinjected weekly into the central amygdala (CeA) before ethanol exposure produced a dose-related sensitization of anxiety during ethanol withdrawal. Subsequently, CRF microinjection into the basolateral amygdala, dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), or dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (d-BNST) also sensitized ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety. In contrast, sensitization of ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety was not observed after weekly CRF administration into the ventral-BNST, CA1-hippocampal region, or hypothalamic-paraventricular nucleus. Then, experiments documented the CRF receptor subtype responsible for CRF and stress sensitization of withdrawal-induced anxiety. Systemic administration of a CRF-1 receptor antagonist before CRF microinjection into the CeA, DRN, or d-BNST prevented CRF-induced sensitization of anxiety during ethanol withdrawal. Furthermore, repeated microinjections of urocortin-3, a CRF-2 receptor agonist, into the CRF-positive sites did not sensitize anxiety after withdrawal from ethanol. Finally, microinjection of a CRF-1 receptor antagonist into the CeA, DRN, or d-BNST before stress blocked sensitization of anxiety-like behavior induced by the repeated stress/ethanol withdrawal protocol. These results indicate that CRF released by stress acts on CRF-1 receptors within specific brain regions to produce a cumulative adaptation that sensitizes anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure.",M2
19830568,"Analgesic actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) on somatic pain sensitivity: involvement of glucocorticoid and CRF-2 receptors.The aim of the present work was to study the involvement of glucocorticoid receptors and corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 receptors (CRF-2 receptors) in mediating the analgesic effects of CRF on somatic pain sensitivity. The involvement of glucocorticoid and CRF-2 receptors in the development of analgesia evoked by systemic administration of CRF was studied by blockade of these receptors by their specific antagonists RU 38486 and astressin 2-B, respectively, in anesthetized rats. Pain sensitivity was tested before and 30 min after administration of CRF in terms of the threshold of the pain reaction induced by stimulation of the rat's tail with an electric current. Blockade of glucocorticoid receptors induced partial suppression of the analgesic action of CRF, while blockade of CRF-2 receptors produced complete suppression of the analgesic effect. These results provide evidence that glucocorticoid and CRF-2 receptors are involved in mediating the analgesic effects of CRF.",M2
19821837,"The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is a neuroanatomical substrate for the inhibition of palatable food intake by neuropeptide S.Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a recently discovered neurotransmitter that binds to its cognate G-protein coupled receptor, NPSR. Previous studies have shown that central administration of this peptide induces anxiolytic-like effects, promotes arousal and inhibits feeding in the same dose range. In the present study, we sought to investigate further the unique physiopharmacological profile of the NPS system by characterizing its effects on palatable food consumption in rats and comparing it with the effect of the classical anxiolytic benzodiazepine midazolam. The results demonstrated that midazolam (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) increases palatable food consumption, while intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NPS markedly reduces it. The anorectic effect of NPS (0.1-1.0 nmol per rat, ICV) was prevented by ICV pretreatment with the NPSR antagonist [D-Cys(tBU)(5)]NPS (20.0-60.0 nmol per rat). Pretreatment with the nonselective corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor (<e>CRF</e>) antagonist alpha-helical CRF 9-41 (6.25 and 12.5 nmol per rat) completely reversed the hypophagic action of CRF (0.4 nmol per rat, ICV) but did not prevent the anorectic effect of ICV NPS (1.0 nmol per rat). Brain site-specific microinjection experiments revealed that NPS markedly inhibits palatable food intake if administered into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). A similar but smaller and shorter lasting reduction of feeding was observed following intra-lateral hypothalamus administration, whereas no effect was observed following injection into the central amygdala. The present study demonstrates that NPS evokes a potent inhibition of palatable food consumption and that the PVN is an important site of action for its effect.",M2
19811447,"The roles of corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in responses to emotional stress: is CRF release a cause or result of fear/anxiety?Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a neuropeptide that is a major regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Recent findings have shown that CRF exists in extrahypothalamic areas in the brain as well as in the hypothalamus, and extrahypothalamic CRF is also deeply involved in stress responses. Therefore, CRF has been a major target of drug development for treatment of stress-related disorders. However, whether CRF is a cause or a result of fear/anxiety has not been investigated extensively, even though this issue is extremely important to the development of treatments for stress-related disorders. This article aims to 1) introduce readers to several functional aspects of CRF, focusing on aspects that have been missed or ignored when determining the roles of CRF in responses to emotional stress; 2) critically review previous studies regarding the roles of CRF in responses to emotional stress, considering functional aspects of CRF described in 1); and 3) put forward a hypothesis about the roles of CRF in stress responses. Considering different functional aspects of CRF, it was suggested that CRF is a result of fear/anxiety, rather than a cause. In other words, CRF could be responsible for stress responses to cope with dangerous situations but not for fear/anxiety itself. CRF as a potential target of drug development for treatment of stress-related disorders is also discussed.",M2
19800945,"Effect of pharmacological manipulations of neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor neurotransmission on incubation of conditioned fear.We recently developed a procedure to study fear incubation in which rats given 100 tone-shock pairings over 10 days show low fear 2 days after conditioned fear training and high fear after 30 or 60 days. Here, we studied the role of the stress-related peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), in fear incubation. We gave rats either 10 or 100 30-s tone-0.5-s footshock pairings over 1 day (short training) or 10 days (long training) and then assessed tone-cue-induced conditioned suppression of lever responding 2 days after short training or 2 days and 1 month after long training. Prior to testing, we injected NPY (5-10 microg, i.c.v.), the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 (20-40 microg, i.c.v.), the NPY Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 (2.5-5 mg/kg s.c.), the non-selective CRF receptor antagonist D-Phe CRF(12-41) (10 microg, i.c.v.), or the CRF1 receptor antagonist MTIP (10-20 mg/kg s.c.). Conditioned suppression after long training was higher after 1 month than after 2 days (fear incubation); conditioned suppression was robustly expressed 2 days after short training (non-incubated fear). Both incubated and non-incubated fear responses were attenuated by NPY. In contrast, D-Phe CRF(12-41), MTIP, BIBO3304, or BIIE0246 had no effect on conditioned fear at the different time points. Results confirm previous work on the potent effect of exogenous NPY administration on conditioned fear, but the negative results with BIBO3304 and BIIE0246 question whether endogenous NPY contributes to incubated (or non-incubated) fear. Results also suggest that CRF receptors are not involved in cue-induced fear in the conditioned suppression procedure.",M2
19800323,"A ventral tegmental <e>CRF</e>-glutamate-dopamine interaction in addiction.Stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking is blocked by antagonists for the stress-related neurohormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). One site of this action is the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where mild footshock stress causes CRF release, glutamate release, and dopaminergic activation in cocaine-experienced but not cocaine-naive animals. Infusion of CRF into VTA has similar effects to footshock in cocaine-experienced animals but fails to cause significant VTA glutamate release or dopaminergic activation in cocaine-naive animals. The reinstatement, glutamate release, and dopamine release are prevented by VTA infusions of CRF-receptor 2 (CRF-R2) but not CRF-R1 antagonists. Reinstatement is triggered by some but not all CRF-R2 agonists and some but not all CRF-R1 agonists; the common denominator of the effective agonists is that they bind to the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP), which appears to be essential for the behavioral and VTA effects of stress and CRF in cocaine-experienced animals. In situ hybridization reveals mRNA for CRF-R1 and CRF-BP but not CRF-R2 in a subset of VTA dopamine neurons. Electron microscopy reveals primarily asymmetric synapses between a subset of VTA terminals containing glutamate and CRF and a subset of VTA dopaminergic neurons and primarily symmetric synapses between a subset of CRF terminals that do not contain glutamate and a subset of GABAergic neurons in VTA. Thus, a complex and not yet fully understood interaction of CRF, glutamate, and the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is established by experience with cocaine, and this alteration appears to contribute importantly to the transition from casual to compulsive cocaine-seeking.",M2
19800322,"Corticotropin-releasing factor in the dorsal raphe nucleus: Linking stress coping and addiction.Addiction and stress are linked at multiple levels. Drug abuse is often initiated as a maladaptive mechanism for coping with stress. It is maintained in part by negative reinforcement to prevent the aversive consequences of stress associated with abstinence. Finally, stress is a major factor leading to relapse in subjects in which drug seeking behavior has extinguished. These associations imply overlapping or converging neural circuits and substrates that underlie the processes of addiction and the expression of the stress response. Here we discuss the major brain serotonin (5-HT) system, the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)-5-HT system as a point of convergence that links these processes and how the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) directs this by a bimodal regulation of DRN neuronal activity. The review begins by describing a structural basis for CRF regulation of the DRN-5-HT system. This is followed by a review of the effects of CRF and stress on DRN function based on electrophysiological and microdialysis studies. The concept that multiple CRF receptor subtypes in the DRN facilitate distinct coping behaviors is reviewed with recent evidence for a unique cellular mechanism by which stress history can determine the type of coping behavior. Finally, work on CRF regulation of the DRN-5-HT system is integrated with literature on the role of 5-HT-dopamine interactions in addiction.",M2
19797401,"Central nesfatin-1 reduces dark-phase food intake and gastric emptying in rats: differential role of corticotropin-releasing factor2 receptor.Nesfatin-1, derived from nucleobindin2, is expressed in the hypothalamus and reported in one study to reduce food intake (FI) in rats. To characterize the central anorexigenic action of nesfatin-1 and whether gastric emptying (GE) is altered, we injected nesfatin-1 into the lateral brain ventricle (intracerebroventricular, icv) or fourth ventricle (4v) in chronically cannulated rats or into the cisterna magna (intracisternal, ic) under short anesthesia and compared with ip injection. Nesfatin-1 (0.05 microg/rat, icv) decreased 2-3 h and 3-6 h dark-phase FI by 87 and 45%, respectively, whereas ip administration (2 microg/rat) had no effect. The corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)(1)/CRF(2) antagonist astressin-B or the CRF(2) antagonist astressin(2)-B abolished icv nesfatin-1's anorexigenic action, whereas an astressin(2)-B analog, devoid of CRF-receptor binding affinity, did not. Nesfatin-1 icv induced a dose-dependent reduction of GE by 26 and 43% that was not modified by icv astressin(2)-B. Nesfatin-1 into the 4v (0.05 microg/rat) or ic (0.5 microg/rat) decreased cumulative dark-phase FI by 29 and 60% at 1 h and by 41 and 37% between 3 and 5 h, respectively. This effect was neither altered by ic astressin(2)-B nor associated with changes in GE. Cholecystokinin (ip) induced Fos expression in 43% of nesfatin-1 neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and 24% of those in the nucleus tractus solitarius. These data indicate that nesfatin-1 acts centrally to reduce dark phase FI through CRF(2)-receptor-dependent pathways after forebrain injection and CRF(2)-receptor-independent pathways after hindbrain injection. Activation of nesfatin-1 neurons by cholecystokinin at sites regulating food intake may suggest a role in gut peptide satiation effect.",M2
19786076,"Neuropeptides modulate compound postsynaptic potentials in basolateral amygdala.Previous behavioral studies have shown that neuropeptides intrinsic to the amygdala formation can alter fear and anxiety states. We have previously shown that the anxiogenic neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) increases inhibitory neurotransmission in basolateral amygdala. We have since observed that CCK induces synchronized rhythmic activity composed of compound postsynaptic potentials (cPSPs). We have now further characterized these cPSPs by inducing cPSPs routinely in 5 mM extracellular K(+). CCK facilitated cPSP occurrence in a dose dependent manner in brain slices from both young and mature rats. The cPSPs were attenuated by glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX or DL-AP5) or low concentrations of GABA(A) receptor antagonists (bicuculline methiodide (BMI), SR95531, or picrotoxin), but not by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CGP52432. Low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 nM) also attenuated the cPSPs. The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter blocker, bumetanide (1 or 10 microM) also blocked the cPSPs. The anxiogenic neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) facilitated cPSPs while anxiolytic neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin) attenuated cPSPs. The benzodiazepine agonist diazepam dose-dependently modulated cPSPs. Mefloquine facilitated cPSPs within 10 min of application. We hypothesize that cPSPs are generated by positive feedback between a subset of interneurons and a subset of glutamatergic projection neurons.",M2

The design and synthesis of low molecular weight non-peptide antagonists for the CRF receptors is a very important area of research as they can be employed in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders. To investigate the ligand-receptor binding mode and design novel CRF1 antagonists, both quantitative and qualitative 3D-QSAR analysis have been performed on a data set of CRF(1) antagonists by using HypoGen and HipHopRefine programs of Catalyst software. The training set of HypoGen study included twenty-five structurally diverse CRF(1) antagonists with Ki values ranging from 0.5 nM to 10 microM. The common feature-based 3D-QSAR study used eight highly potent CRF(1) antagonists and four poor antagonistic ligands to generate 3D-pharmacophore models with excluded volumes. The obtained 3D-pharmacophore models from each study served as queries for virtual screening with a 'focused compound library' for novel CRF(1) antagonist development. Pharmacophore models obtained for antagonist binding are useful for CRF related chemical biology and drug design. Strategies and methods employed in this paper are simple and practical for medicinal chemists in drug R&amp;D.",M2
19747494,"Swim stress enhances nociceptin/orphanin FQ-induced inhibition of rat dorsal raphe nucleus activity in vivo and in vitro: role of corticotropin releasing factor.The effects of nociceptin/orphanin FQ on putative serotonin (5HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), known to modulate the behavioral responses to stress, were investigated in vivo and in vitro. In DRN slices from unstressed rats, nociceptin/orphanin FQ concentration-dependently inhibited the firing rate of putative 5HT neurons (EC(50) = 21.6 +/- 1.21 nM) and the selective NOP receptor antagonist UFP-101 shifted the concentration-response curve to the right (estimated pA(2) 6.86). Nociceptin/orphanin FQ potency was enhanced in slices prepared from rats previously subjected to a 15 min swim stress (EC(50) = 1.98 +/- 0.11 nM). Swim stress did not change the number or affinity of NOP receptors in DRN. Stress-elicited potentiation involved corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)(1) receptors, GABA signaling and protein synthesis, being attenuated by pre-treatment with antalarmin (20 mg/kg, i.p.), diazepam (2.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and cycloheximide (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), respectively. In anesthetized unstressed rats, locally applied nociceptin/orphanin FQ (0.03 and 0.1 ng/30 nl) inhibited the firing rate of DRN neurons (to 80 +/- 7 and 54 +/- 10% of baseline, respectively). Nociceptin/orphanin FQ inhibition was potentiated both 24 h after swim stress and 1 h after CRF (30 ng/30 nl intra-DRN). Stress-induced potentiation was prevented by the selective CRF(1) receptor antagonist, NBI 30755 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, the inhibitory response of DRN neurons to the 5HT(1A) agonist, 8OH-DPAT (1 microg/1 microl, intra-DRN) was not potentiated by swim stress, ruling out a non-specific enhanced permeability of GIRK channel. Together, these findings suggest that CRF and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ/NOP system interact in the DRN during stress to control 5HT transmission; this may play a role in stress-related neuropsychopathologies.",M2
19744557,"Failure of the feeding response to fasting in carnitine-deficient juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice: involvement of defective acyl-ghrelin secretion and enhanced corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the hypothalamus.Carnitine-deficient juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice, suffering from fatty acid metabolism abnormalities, have reduced locomotor activity after fasting. We examined whether JVS mice exhibit specific defect in the feeding response to fasting, a key process of anti-famine homeostatic mechanism. Carnitine-deficient JVS mice showed grossly defective feeding response to 24 h-fasting, with almost no food intake in the first 4 h, in marked contrast to control animals. JVS mice also showed defective acyl-ghrelin response to fasting, less suppressed leptin, and seemingly normal corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) expression in the hypothalamus despite markedly increased plasma corticosterone. The anorectic response was ameliorated by intraperitoneal administration of carnitine or acyl-ghrelin, with decreased CRF expression. Intracerebroventricular treatment of CRF type 2 receptor antagonist, anti-sauvagine-30, recovered the defective feeding response of 24 h-fasted JVS mice. The defective feeding response to fasting in carnitine-deficient JVS mice is due to the defective acyl-ghrelin and enhanced CRF signaling in the hypothalamus through fatty acid metabolism abnormalities.

Previously, we reported that Ca(2+) influx through voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) contributes to spontaneous somatodendritic DA release. Since corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) regulates VOCC, we sought to determine whether urocortin affects somatodendritic DA release in the isolated DA neurons using amperometry method. The application of urocortin reversibly inhibited both VOCC and the frequency of DA release events via the activation of type-1 CRF receptor. The blockers for L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels effectively abolished the effects of urocortin both on the frequency of DA release events and on Ca(2+) current. These results indicate that CRF inhibits somatodendritic DA release by inhibiting L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels. Thus, the inhibition of somatodendritic DA release by stress hormone may be one of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of stress on motor function.",M2
19720102,"beta-Lactotensin derived from bovine beta-lactoglobulin suppresses food intake via the <e>CRF</e> system followed by the CGRP system in mice.We found that beta-lactotensin (His-Ile-Arg-Leu), which has been isolated as an ileum-contracting peptide from chymotrypsin digest of bovine beta-lactoglobulin, dose-dependently suppresses food intake after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneal administration at a dose of 40 nmol/mouse or 100mg/kg, respectively, in fasted mice. Orally administered beta-lactotensin also suppressed food intake at 500 mg/kg. We previously reported that beta-lactotensin acts as an agonist for neurotensin receptors; however, the anorexigenic activity of beta-lactotensin was not inhibited by i.c.v. co-administration with SR48692 or levocabastine, an antagonist for neurotensin NT(1) or NT(2) receptor, respectively. On the other hand, the anorexigenic effect of beta-lactotensin was blocked by i.c.v. co-administration with astressin or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)(8-37), an antagonist for corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or CGRP, respectively. beta-Lactotensin had affinity for neither CRF nor CGRP receptor. In addition, CRF-induced anorexigenic activity after i.c.v. administration was completely blocked by CGRP(8-37), while CGRP-induced anorexigenic activity was not inhibited by astressin. These results suggest that the CGRP system is activated downstream of the CRF system in food intake regulation. Taken together, beta-lactotensin may suppress food intake by activating the CRF system followed by the CGRP system, independently of the neurotensin system.",M2
19716811,"The dynorphin/kappa opioid system as a modulator of stress-induced and pro-addictive behaviors.Stress is a complex experience that carries both aversive and motivating properties. Chronic stress causes an increase in the risk of depression, is well known to increase relapse of drug seeking behavior, and can adversely impact health. Several brain systems have been demonstrated to be critical in mediating the negative affect associated with stress, and recent evidence directly links the actions of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide dynorphin in modulating mood and increasing the rewarding effects of abused drugs. These results suggest that activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system is likely to play a major role in the pro-addictive effects of stress. This review explores the relationship between dynorphin and corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in the induction of dysphoria, the potentiation of drug seeking, and stress-induced reinstatement. We also provide an overview of the signal transduction events responsible for CRF and dynorphin/KOR-dependent behaviors. Understanding the recent work linking activation of CRF and dynorphin/KOR systems and their specific roles in brain stress systems and behavioral models of addiction provides novel insight to neuropeptide systems that regulate affective state.",M2
19716349,"Peripheral relays in stress-induced activation of visceral afferents in the gut.Multiple organs are targeted by the stress response, but the focus of this article is on stress-induced activation of visceral afferents in the gut. During recent years it became apparent that mast cells are pivotal in this response. Peripheral corticotrophin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) induces their degranulation whereupon mast cell mediators activate visceral afferents. In addition, these mediators are responsible for gut barrier dysfunction and subsequent influx of luminal antigens and bacteria. Some research groups have begun to investigate the possible importance of barrier dysfunction for enhanced visceral sensitivity. After reviewing the current knowledge on CRF-induced mast cell degranulation we will discuss these groundbreaking papers in a more elaborate way. They form the basis for a hypothesis in which not only CRF-induced but also antigen-mediated mast cell degranulation is relevant to stress-related afferent activation. Part of this hypothesis is certainly speculative and needs further investigation. At the end of this article we sum up some of the unanswered questions raised by others and during this review.",M2
19707872,"Urocortin prevents indomethacin-induced small intestinal lesions in rats through activation of CRF2 receptors.PURPOSE: The role of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced small intestinal lesions was examined in rats. METHODS: Animals were given indomethacin (10 mg/kg) subcutaneously and killed 24 h later. Urocortin I [a nonselective CRF receptor (CRFR) agonist], astressin (a nonselective CRFR antagonist), NBI-27914 (a CRFR1 antagonist), or astressin-2B (a CRFR2 antagonist) was given intravenously 10 min before the administration of indomethacin. RESULTS: Indomethacin caused hemorrhagic lesions in the small intestine, accompanied by intestinal hypermotility, mucosal invasion of enterobacteria, up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and an increase of mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Pretreatment of the animals with astressin, a non-selective CRFR antagonist, aggravated the lesions in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, astressin-2B also exacerbated the intestinal ulcerogenic response induced by indomethacin, while NBI-27914 did not. Urocortin I prevented indomethacin-induced intestinal lesions, together with the suppression of bacterial invasion and an increase in mucosal MPO activity and iNOS expression; these effects were significantly reversed by co-administration of astressin-2B but not NBI-27914. Urocortin I suppressed the hypermotility response to indomethacin, and this effect was also abrogated by astressin-2B but not NBI-27914. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that urocortin 1 prevents indomethacin-induced small intestinal lesions, and that this action is mediated by the activation of CRFR2 and is functionally associated with the suppression of the intestinal hypermotility response caused by indomethacin. It is assumed that endogenous CRF contributes to the maintenance of the mucosal defensive ability of the small intestine against indomethacin through the activation of CRFR2.",M2
19706546,"Functional CRH variation increases stress-induced alcohol consumption in primates.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), encoded by the CRH gene, is a key integrator of stress responses, and, as such, CRH gene variation may contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to stress-related pathology. In rhesus macaques, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is found within the CRH promoter (-248C--&gt; T). Here, we assessed whether this variant influenced stress responding and, because increased CRF system activity drives alcohol drinking in rodents, we examined whether it predicted voluntary alcohol consumption as a function of prior stress exposure. Using a hypothalamic nuclear extract, we showed that the -248 T allele resulted in increased DNA protein interactions relative to the C allele. In vitro, the T allele resulted in CRH promoter activity that was higher following both stimulation with forskolin and treatment with dexamethasone. Endocrine and behavioral responses to social separation stress (release of ACTH and cortisol, and suppression of environmental exploration, respectively) were higher among carriers of the T allele, particularly among those exposed to early adversity in the form of peer rearing. We also found that T allele carriers with a history of early life adversity consumed more alcohol in a limited-access paradigm. Our data suggest that CRH promoter variation that confers increased stress reactivity increases the risk for alcohol use disorders in stress-exposed individuals.",M2
19699720,"Comparison of somatostatin and corticotrophin-releasing hormone immunoreactivity in forebrain neurons projecting to taste-responsive and non-responsive regions of the parabrachial nucleus in rat.Several forebrain areas have been shown to project to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and exert inhibitory and excitatory influences on taste processing. The neurochemicals by which descending forebrain inputs modulate neural taste-evoked responses remain to be established. This study investigated the existence of somatostatin (SS) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in forebrain neurons that project to caudal regions of the PBN responsive to chemical stimulation of the anterior tongue as well as more rostral unresponsive regions. Retrograde tracer was iontophoretically or pressure ejected from glass micropipettes, and 7 days later the animals were euthanized for subsequent immunohistochemical processing for co-localization of tracer with SS and CRF in tissue sections containing the lateral hypothalamus (LH), central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and insular cortex (IC). In each forebrain site, robust labeling of cells with distinguishable nuclei and short processes was observed for SS and CRF. The results indicate that CRF neurons in each forebrain site send projections throughout the rostral caudal extent of the PBN with a greater percentage terminating in regions rostral to the anterior tongue-responsive area. For SS, the percentage of double-labeled neurons was more forebrain site specific in that only BNST and CeA exhibited significant numbers of double-labeled neurons. Few retrogradely labeled cells in LH co-expressed SS, while no double-labeled cells were observed in IC. Again, tracer injections into rostral PBN resulted in a greater percentage of double-labeled neurons in BNST and CeA compared to caudal injections. The present results suggest that some sources of descending forebrain input might utilize somatostatin and/or CRF to exert a broad influence on sensory information processing in the PBN.",M2
19675229,"Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonism within the dorsal raphe nucleus reduces social anxiety-like behavior after early-life social isolation.Social isolation of rats during the early part of development increases social anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Furthermore, early-life social isolation increases the levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptors in the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (dRN) of adult rats. Interactions between serotonin and CRF systems are thought to mediate anxiety behavior. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CRF receptor antagonism within the dRN on social anxiety-like behavior after early-life social isolation. Male rats were reared in isolation or in groups from weaning until midadolescence, and rehoused in groups and allowed to develop into adulthood. Adult rats underwent surgery to implant a drug cannula into the dRN. After recovery from surgery and acclimation to the testing arena, rats were infused with vehicle or the CRF receptor antagonist d-Phe-CRF((12-41)) (50 or 500 ng) into the dRN before a social interaction test. Isolation-reared rats pretreated with vehicle exhibited increased social anxiety-like behavior compared with rats reared in groups. Pretreatment of the dRN with d-Phe-CRF((12-41)) significantly reduced social anxiety-like behaviors exhibited by isolation-reared rats. Overall, this study shows that early-life social stress results in heightened social anxiety-like behavior, which is reversed by CRF antagonism within the dRN. These data suggest that CRF receptor antagonists could provide a potential treatment of stress-related social anxiety.",M2
19653930,"Neonatal rearing conditions distinctly shape locus coeruleus neuronal activity, dendritic arborization, and sensitivity to corticotrophin-releasing factor.Early life events influence vulnerability to psychiatric illness. This has been modelled in rats and it has been demonstrated that different durations of maternal separation shape adult endocrine and behavioural stress reactivity. One system through which maternal separation may act is the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine system that regulates emotional arousal. Here we demonstrate that different durations of maternal separation have distinct effects on LC physiology and dendritic morphology. Rat pups were separated from the dam for 15 min/d (HMS-15) or 180 min/d (HMS-180) from post-natal days 2-14. Others were either undisturbed (HMS-0) or were vendor-purchased controls. LC characteristics were compared at age 22-35 d using whole-cell recordings in vitro. Cells were filled with biocytin for morphological analysis. LC neurons of HMS-180 rats were tonically activated compared to HMS-15 and control rats, with firing rates that were 2-fold higher than these groups. Corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) application did not further activate LC neurons of HMS-180 rats but increased LC firing rate in HMS-0 and control rats. LC neurons of HMS-15 rats were resistant to excitation by CRF. Maternal separation also affected LC dendritic morphology. LC dendrites of HMS-15 rats exhibited less branching and decreased total dendritic length, an effect that could decrease the probability of contacting limbic afferents that terminate in the pericoerulear region. This effect may provide a structural basis for an attenuated magnitude of emotional arousal. Together, these results demonstrate long-term consequences of early life events on the LC-norepinephrine system that may shape adult behaviour.",M2
19646444,"Characterization of a corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)/diuretic hormone-like peptide from tunicates: insight into the origins of the vertebrate CRF family.The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) superfamily of peptides includes the four paralogous vertebrate peptide lineages of CRF, urotensin-1/urocortin/sauvagine, urocortin 2 and urocortin 3, as well as the diuretic hormones (DH) and peptides of the arthropods. However, there are considerable sequence differences between the group of vertebrate peptides and those of the arthropods, notably insects. Because of the likely incidence of the formation of paralogous forms within the insects and the great variation in primary structures among these peptides, establishing the structure of the ancestral vertebrate version has not been possible. We screened the genomes of the tunicates, Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignii, in silico, using the various conserved motifs of both the vertebrate CRF paralogues and the insect diuretic hormone sequences to identify the structure of the Ciona CRF/DH-like peptide genes. A single peptide gene was found in both genomes that possessed motifs reflective of both groups of peptides. These structures suggest a single CRF-like peptide was inherited by vertebrates and possibly chordates. Moreover, the conserved structure of the CRF peptide may have become constrained once it became associated with the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal axis.",M2
19635511,"Participation of corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 receptors in the acute, chronic and withdrawal actions of nicotine associated with feeding behavior in rats.We investigated the role of corticotropin-releasing factor type 2 (<e>CRF</e>(2)) receptors in acute, chronic and withdrawal effects of nicotine on feeding behavior in rats. Nicotine was injected intraperitoneally, whereas CRF, CRF(2) receptors agonist urocortin-1 or selective antagonist astressin2-B were administered directly into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In acute studies, nicotine, CRF or urocortin-1 produced dose dependent anorexia at 2 and 4h post-injection time-points, however, astressin2-B did not alter the food intake. Prior treatment of CRF or urocortin-1 potentiated the anorectic effect of nicotine, while astressin2-B showed opposite response. Chronic administration of nicotine produced tolerance to anorexia and caused persistent weight loss. However, concomitant treatment with CRF or urocortin-1 resulted in early tolerance to nicotine-induced anorexia. In the same set of animals, while CRF pre-treatment potentiated the weight reducing effect of nicotine, urocortin-1 failed to do so. Although abrupt termination of chronic nicotine treatment caused hyperphagia and weight gain, administration of CRF or urocortin-1 prevented these effects. These results suggest that CRF(2) receptors, within the framework of PVN, may contribute to the acute, chronic and withdrawal responses of nicotine on feeding and body weight.",M2
19632905,"Cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 in spinally projecting neurons are involved in <e>CRF</e>-induced sympathetic activation.Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the brain has been shown to stimulate sympathetic activity, leading to elevations of blood pressure, heart rate and plasma catecholamine levels and neuronal activation of the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. We previously reported that brain cyclooxygenase (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostanoids, is involved in centrally administered CRF-induced sympathetic activation in rats. Therefore, the present study was designed to reveal the effect of centrally administered CRF (1.5 nmol/animal) on the expression of COX isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2, in spinally projecting neurons until 6h after the administration, using rats microinjected with a monosynaptic retrograde tracer into the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic spinal cord. Retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), raphe pallidus nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla. Centrally administered CRF significantly increased the number of spinally projecting PVN neurons expressing COX-1 throughout the experimental period and those expressing COX-2 during only the late phase. CRF also increased the number of spinally projecting LC neurons expressing COX-2 throughout the experimental period. In other regions, the CRF administration had no effect on COXs expression in spinally projecting neurons. These results suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 in the PVN and COX-2 in the LC play roles in the CRF-induced sympathetic regulation in rats.",M2
19631614,"Role of <e>CRF</e> and other neuropeptides in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.A central problem in the treatment of drug addiction is high rates of relapse to drug use after periods of forced or self-imposed abstinence. This relapse is often provoked by exposure to stress. Stress-induced relapse to drug seeking can be modeled in laboratory animals using a reinstatement procedure. In this procedure, drug-taking behaviors are extinguished and then reinstated by acute exposure to stressors like intermittent unpredictable footshock, restraint, food deprivation, and systemic injections of yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that induces stress-like responses in humans and nonhumans. For this special issue entitled  The role of neuropeptides in stress and addiction , we review results from studies on the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and several other peptides in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in laboratory animals. The results of the studies reviewed indicate that extrahypothalamic CRF plays a critical role in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking; this role is largely independent of drug class, experimental procedure, and type of stressor. There is also limited evidence for the role of dynorphins, hypocretins (orexins), nociceptin (orphanin FQ), and leptin in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.",M2
19631474,"Icariin attenuates chronic mild stress-induced dysregulation of the LHPA stress circuit in rats.Chronic mild stress (CMS) is suggested to develop dysregulation of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) stress circuit. Icariin, a major constituent of flavonoids isolated from Epimedium brevicornum, has been previously confirmed to rescue the HPA axis abnormalities in animal models of depression. However, antidepressant treatment of icariin on corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system within the LHPA stress circuit and its interaction with serotonergic receptor are still seldom studied in CMS model of animals. The present study further investigated the effects of CMS procedure and subsequent icariin treatment on mRNA and protein levels of CRF, CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and CRF binding protein (CRFBP), as well as sucrose intake in rats. Moreover, the levels of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HTR1A) in hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal cortex were simultaneously evaluated for their participations in CRF system in this model. We found that CMS procedure significantly increased CRF expression levels in the brain regions, and decreased GR and 5-HTR1A in hippocampus and frontal cortex, with sucrose intake reduction representing the hedonic deficit in rats. Icariin restored these alterations in CMS rats. These results confirmed the hypothesis that icariin exerted antidepressant-like effect via its regulation of central CRF system. And hippocampus was suggested as an important neural area controlling the LHPA stress circuit in icariin-treated CMS rats. These findings for the first time proved that the potential molecular mechanism of antidepressant action of icariin was targeted on the interaction of the LHPA stress circuit and serotonergic function in CMS rats.",M2
19628576,"Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B by corticotropin-releasing factor in human monocytes.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) exerts proinflammatory effects in peripheral tissues, whereas the intracellular pathways mediating these effects have not been completely characterized yet. We have previously shown that CRF induces nuclear factor-kappaB DNA-binding activity in mouse and human leukocytes. Here we demonstrate that in the human monocytic THP-1 cells, CRF activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. These effects of CRF are mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRF2), as suggested by their abolishment after treatment with the specific CRF2 antagonist, astressin 2B. The CRF-mediated PI3K/Akt activation induces cell survival as suggested by the stimulation of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2. ERK1/2 activation results in up-regulation of IL-8 expression, an effect inhibited by the CRF-induced activation of PI3K/Akt. These studies demonstrate novel effects of CRF in human monocytes mediated by the activation of PI3K/Akt. Moreover, they reveal pathway-specific effects of the CRF/CRF2 system in chemokine activation and cell survival that may be of importance for the development of novel therapeutics for inflammatory diseases.",M2
19621274,"Effects of corticoliberin on synaptic transmission in rat olfactory cortex slices in a water immersion model of depression.Corticoliberin (corticotrophin-releasing factor, <e>CRF</e>, CRH) is an active regulator of endocrine, autonomic, and immune functions in stress, as well as a mediator of anxiety, determining the behavioral stress response. The present report describes studies of its action on neuron activity evoked by microstimulation of olfactory cortex slices. Behavioral testing in a T maze was used to select individuals with a passive behavioral strategy from a population of Wistar rats, and the animals were subjected to water immersion. Olfactory cortex slices were prepared 10 days later and evoked focal potentials were recorded on perfusion with medium containing corticoliberin (0.1 microM). Among active rats, 60% of slices retained high excitability after stress, and corticoliberin produced only insignificant reductions in the amplitudes of excitatory potentials in these slices, simultaneously increasing the amplitudes of inhibitory potentials. Low excitability was found in 40% of slices from active stressed rats, and corticoliberin had a significant inhibitory effect in these slices. Addition of corticoliberin to the incubation medium used for slices from passive rats with initially low excitability led to complete blockade of synaptic transmission. These data support the involvement of corticoliberin in the development of depression.",M2
19619932,"Amniotic fluid urocortin, <e>CRF</e>, oestriol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol concentrations at mid-trimester: putative relationship with preterm delivery.OBJECTIVE: Stress-related peptide and steroid hormones are involved in the pathogenesis of preterm delivery, even though their clinical usefulness as predictive markers of preterm delivery remains unclear. The present study evaluated whether mid-trimester amniotic fluid concentrations of stress-related peptides, that is corticothophin-releasing factor (CRF) and urocortin (Ucn) and feto-placental steroids (oestriol, DHEA-S and cortisol) correlated with preterm delivery. STUDY DESIGN: It is a retrospective case-control study. Healthy women (n=130) undergoing amniocentesis at mid-gestation for genetic indications, of whom 15 had a preterm delivery (cases) and 115 delivered at term (controls). CRF, urocortin, cortisol, DHEA-S and oestriol concentrations were measured by specific and sensitive immunoenzymatic assays. RESULTS: Amniotic fluid urocortin concentrations in the cases (0.50+/-0.07 ng/ml) (M+/-SD) were significantly lower (P&lt;0.0001) than in the control group (0.90+/-0.26 ng/ml), while CRF concentrations did not differ between the cases (1.52+/-0.39 ng/ml) and control group (1.64+/-0.68 ng/ml). Amniotic fluid cortisol (17.71+/-3.72 ng/ml vs. 17.32+/-3.17 ng/ml), DHEA-S (0.16+/-0.06 ng/ml vs. 0.17+/-0.09 ng/ml) and oestriol (4.68+/-1.95 ng/ml vs. 4.79+/-1.84 ng/ml) concentrations were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The low amniotic fluid concentrations of urocortin at mid-trimester may be a signal of predisposition to preterm delivery, while the unchanged CRF and steroid hormones concentrations in women delivering preterm suggest that this mechanisms are not yet activated at mid-trimester.",M2

Both receive projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and both project to brain areas that mediate fear-influenced behaviors. In contrast to CeA(M) however, initial attempts to implicate the BNST in conditioned fear responses were largely unsuccessful. More recent studies have shown that the BNST does participate in some types of anxiety and stress responses. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the CeA(M) and BNST(L) are functionally complementary, with CeA(M) mediating short- but not long-duration threat responses (i.e., phasic fear) and BNST(L) mediating long- but not short-duration responses (sustained fear or 'anxiety'). We also review findings implicating the stress-related peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in sustained but not phasic threat responses, and attempt to integrate these findings into a neural circuit model which accounts for these and related observations.",M2
19581799,"Central urocortin 3 administration decreases limited-access ethanol intake in nondependent mice.Stress and alcohol abuse are co-related. Acute alcohol is anxiolytic and stress is cited as a factor in relapse to alcohol use. A primary mediator of the stress response is the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>). The CRF family of endogenous ligands includes urocortin 3 (Ucn 3), which binds selectively to the CRF type 2 receptor and has been implicated in ethanol consumption in dependent and withdrawing rats. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of Ucn 3, delivered centrally to nondependent mice, on limited-access ethanol consumption. Adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to self-administer 10% ethanol during daily, 2-h limited-access sessions, using lickometers to assess drinking patterns for both ethanol and water. Sterile saline or 0.3, 1, or 3 nmol of Ucn 3 was microinjected into the lateral ventricle immediately before the limited-access session in a within-subjects design. There was a significant decrease in ethanol (both ml and g/kg), but not water, intake following Ucn 3 treatment, explained by a change in size of the largest lick run. Food intake at both 2 h and 24 h after injection was statistically unaffected by Ucn 3 administration. These results establish a role for CRF type 2 receptors in a nondependent mouse model of ethanol self-administration.",M2
19578795,"Activity of the 5-HT1A receptor is involved in the alteration of glucocorticoid receptor in hippocampus and corticotropin-releasing factor in hypothalamus in SPS rats.Rats exposed to single-prolonged stress (SPS) showed enhanced inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system and alteration in the glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid receptor. Dysfunction of the HPA axis is one of the core neuroendocrine abnormalities of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Serotonergic receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) have been proposed to play major roles in dysfunction of the HPA axis. However, the precise molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the changes of GR in hippocampus as well as CRF in hypothalamus and the activity of 5-HT1A receptor in SPS rats. We exposed rats to SPS with or without prior treatment with WAY100635 (the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist), and observed behavioral changes, GR levels in the hippocampus and CRF levels in the hypothalamus by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and RT-PCR seven days after SPS. Our results demonstrate that SPS increases expression of GR and CRF, which were partially inhibited by WAY-100635.",M2
19573542,"Corticotropin releasing factor-induced ERK phosphorylation in AtT20 cells occurs via a cAMP-dependent mechanism requiring EPAC2.<e>CRF</e>-induced ERK phosphorylation has been shown to be an important mechanism underlying expression of pro-opiomelanocortin, a key precursor molecule in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. In AtT20 cells, CRF signalling has been investigated but the mechanism behind CRF-induced ERK activity is not fully understood. This paper elucidates the signalling cascade involved in this phenomenon. Involvement of CRF(1) receptor on ERK phosphorylation was shown by using CRF and urocortin 1. The lack of inhibitory effect of pertussis toxin and BAPTA-AM excluded involvement of G(i)-coupling and calcium mobilization respectively. In contrast, the process is suggested to be driven by cAMP since treatment of AtT20 cells with forskolin triggered strong ERK phosphorylation. Treatment with PKA inhibitors had a minor effect on CRF-induced ERK signalling while phosphorylation of CREB was completely abolished. This ruled out involvement of PKA and suggested a role for exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). Moreover, an activator of EPACs 8-(4-methoxyphenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate mimicked CRF-induced ERK phosphorylation. Gene expression analysis showed high levels of EPAC2 mRNA and protein but low levels of EPAC1. Knockdown of EPAC2 expression by the use of specific siRNAs abolished CRF- and forskolin-induced ERK phosphorylation. The current study demonstrates a clear cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent mechanism underlying CRF-induced ERK activity that proceeds via EPAC2 signalling. Further research will provide more insight in the role of EPAC2 in CRF signalling.",M2
19572944,"Urocortin promotes the development of vasculitis in a rat model of thromboangiitis obliterans via corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptors.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Urocortin is a locally expressed pro-inflammatory peptide. Here we have examined the effects of urocortin on sodium laurate-induced peripheral arterial vasculitis in rats, modelling the mechanisms of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Peripheral vasculitis in rats was induced by sodium laurate and graded by gross appearance on the 12th day after injection. Histological changes in rat femoral arteries were assessed by histopathology and transmission electron microscopy. Blood cell counts, blood rheology, blood coagulation and plasma urocortin, thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin E(2) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels were measured. Expression of urocortin, corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>(1/2)) receptors, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at both mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. KEY RESULTS: Rats showed grossly visible signs and symptoms of TAO on the 12th day after sodium laurate injection. In these rats, blood was in a hypercoagulable state; plasma urocortin, prostaglandin E(2) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels were elevated; and the expression of urocortin, CRF(1) and CRF(1alpha)-receptors, COX-2 and ICAM-1 in rat femoral arteries were markedly increased. Exogenous urocortin, given for 12 days after sodium laurate, exacerbated the hypercoagulable state and augmented expression of CRF(1alpha)-receptors, COX-2 and ICAM-1. These effects were abolished by a CRF(1)-receptor antagonist, NBI-27914, or a non-selective CRF-receptor antagonist, astressin, but not by the CRF(2)-receptor antagonist, antisauvagine-30, given with exogenous urocortin. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Urocortin exacerbated the hypercoagulable state and vasculitis in a model of TAO induced by sodium laurate in rats, via CRF(1)-receptors. COX-2 and ICAM-1 might also have contributed to this exacerbation.",M2
19553908,"Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) increase the risk for affective disorders in human survivors. Postischemic anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors have been documented in animal models of CA/CPR; however, the stability of post-CA/CPR anxiety-like behavior over time and the underlying physiologic mechanisms remain unknown. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) system may mediate the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression; therefore, this study measured CA/CPR-induced changes in CRF receptor binding and HPA axis negative feedback. Mice were exposed to CA/CPR or SHAM surgery and assessed 7 or 21 days later. Consistent with earlier demonstrations of anxiety-like behavior 7 days after CA/CPR, increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field was also present 21 days after CA/CPR. On postoperative day 7, CA/CPR was associated with an increase in basal serum corticosterone concentration relative to SHAM, but this difference resolved by postoperative day 21. The Dexamethasone Suppression Test showed that the CA/CPR group had enhanced negative feedback compared with SHAM controls at postoperative day 21. Furthermore, there was a gradual increase in CRF(1) receptor binding in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, as well as a transient decrease of both CRF(1) and CRF(2A) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, sustained changes in activity of the HPA axis and the CRF system after CA/CPR may contribute to the postischemic increase in affective disorders.",M2
19539724,"Subcellular plasticity of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor in dendrites of the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis following chronic opiate exposure.Chronic opiate administration alters the expression levels of the stress-responsive peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). This brain region contains CRF receptors that drive drug-seeking behavior exacerbated by stress. We used electron microscopy to quantitatively compare immunolabeling of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFr) and CRF in the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTal) of mice injected with saline or morphine in escalating doses for 14 days. We also compared the results with those in non-injected control mice. The tissue was processed for CRFr immunogold and CRF immunoperoxidase labeling. The non-injected controls had a significantly lower plasmalemmal density of CRFr immunogold particles in dendrites compared with mice receiving saline, but not those receiving morphine, injections. Compared with saline, however, mice receiving chronic morphine showed a significantly lower plasmalemmal, and greater cytoplasmic, density of CRFr immunogold in dendrites. Within the cytoplasmic compartment of somata and dendrites of the BSTal, the proportion of CRFr gold particles associated with mitochondria was three times as great in mice receiving morphine compared with saline. This subcellular distribution is consistent with morphine,- and CRFr-associated modulation of intracellular calcium release or oxidative stress. The between-group changes occurred without effect on the total number of dendritic CRFr immunogold particles, suggesting that chronic morphine enhances internalization or decreases delivery of the CRFr to the plasma membrane, a trafficking effect that is also affected by the stress of daily injections. In contrast, saline and morphine treatment groups showed no significant differences in the total number of CRF-immunoreactive axon terminals, or the frequency with which these terminals contacted CRFr-containing dendrites. This suggests that morphine does not influence axonal availability of CRF in the BSTal. The results have important implications for drug-associated adaptations in brain stress systems that may contribute to the motivation to continue drug use during dependence.",M2
19537192,"[Chronic administration of <e>CRF</e> makes depression like changes in rats]For studying the role of CRF in the process of depression, chronic intra-cerebral ventricular administration of CRF in normal rats for 21 days were performed and compared with the depression model of chronic unpredictable miled stress (CUMS) in rats. The Open-field Test and Morris water Maze were employed to test the ability of locomotion and learning and memory. HPLC-UV, RT-PCR were employed to analyze the level of blood serum cortisol and the expression of CRF as well as its receptors (R1 and R2) of CUMS models. After chronic stress, the locomotion activity and spatial learning and memory ability decreased obviously, while the level of serum cortisol increased evidently, and the CRF and its receptor-1 mRNA levels were higher compared with those in normal rats. The rats with chronic administration of CRF also consistently decreased the weight gain, locomotion activity and the ability of spatial learning and memory as the CUMS model. This work demonstrates that CRF plays a very important role in the depression genesis and development, sustained elevation of CRF induced by stress may be the chief factor for depression.",M2
19523931,"Power spectrum analysis of ultrasonic vocalization elicited by maternal separation in rat pups.The present study investigated how frequency distribution of maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalization was altered by environmental stimuli and pharmacological agents. Sprague-Dawley rat pups at 10 days were used to measure numbers and frequencies of the ultrasonic vocalizations under various ambient temperatures and with pharmacological manipulations of the corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and GABAergic systems. The ultrasonic vocalization consisted of two distinct peaks in the frequency range of 30 kHz to 50 kHz. The area under the curve (AUC) in the high-frequency range and the number of the ultrasonic vocalizations increased when ambient temperature was lowered. Systemic administration of a selective CRF1 receptor antagonist, NBI27914, and a typical anxiolytic, diazepam, decreased the AUC in the high-frequency range and the number of the ultrasonic vocalizations in a dose-dependent manner at an ambient temperature of 24 degrees C. The AUC in the low-frequency range did not change with an alteration in ambient temperature or treatment with NBI27914 and diazepam except a high dose (1 mg/kg) of diazepam. These results demonstrated that emotional levels of isolated pups reflected not only the number but also the frequency distribution of maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. High-frequency components, but not low-frequency components, of the ultrasonic vocalization were sensitive to changes in negative affective state of isolated pups.",M2
19505767,"Neonatal stress affects vulnerability of cholinergic neurons and cognition in the rat: involvement of the HPA axis.Adverse experiences early in life may sensitize specific neurocircuits to subsequent stressors. We have evaluated in maternal separation (MS) rats, an animal paradigm of early-life stress, the effects of a selective cholinergic lesion on cognitive function as well as susceptibility of cholinergic neurons to the lesion. MS rats subjected to a cholinergic lesion by administration of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin, showed significant decreases in both choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity compared to control lesioned rats. Morris water maze results revealed a significant impairment in learning and memory function in MS adult rats and further cognitive deficits after the lesion. The lesion of cholinergic neurons induced a significant decrease in glucocorticoid receptor density in MS rats, accompanied by increases in <e>CRF</e> mRNA expression. Decreases in NGF and increases in NGF-p75NTR expression have also been found in MS rats. Our results suggest that vulnerability of basal forebrain cholinergic nerve cells might be affected by the HPA axis. The present data are discussed not only in terms of conditions that occur during ageing or Alzheimer disease, but also regarding a purported involvement of the cholinergic system in the regulation of HPA axis activity.",M2
19494159,"The central nucleus of the amygdala and corticotropin-releasing factor: insights into contextual fear memory.The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has been traditionally viewed in fear conditioning to serve as an output neural center that transfers conditioned information formed in the basolateral amygdala to brain structures that generate emotional responses. Recent studies suggest that the CeA may also be involved in fear memory consolidation. In addition, corticotropin-releasing factor systems were shown to facilitate memory consolidation in the amygdala, which contains a high density of <e>CRF</e> immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the lateral part of the CeA (CeAl). However, the involvement of CeA CRF in contextual fear conditioning remains poorly understood. Therefore, we first conducted a series of studies using fiber-sparing lesion and reversible inactivation methods to assess the general role of the CeA in contextual fear. We then used identical training and testing procedures to compare and evaluate the specific function of CeA CRF using CRF antisense oligonucleotides (CRF ASO). Rats microinjected with ibotenic acid, muscimol, or a CRF ASO into the CeA before contextual fear conditioning showed typical levels of freezing during acquisition training but exhibited significant reductions in contextual freezing in a retention test 48 h later. Furthermore, CeA inactivation induced by either muscimol or CRF ASO administration immediately before retention testing did not impair freezing, suggesting that the previously observed retention deficits were caused by inhibition of consolidation rather than fear expression. Collectively, our results suggest CeA involvement in the consolidation of contextual fear memory and specifically implicate CeA CRF as an important mediator.",M2
19492314,"Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone attenuates behavioral effects of corticotropin-releasing factor in isolated guinea pig pups.During a 3-hr period of social isolation in a novel environment, guinea pig pups exhibit an initial active phase of behavioral responsiveness, characterized primarily by vocalizing, which is then followed by a stage of passive responsiveness in which pups display a distinctive crouch, eye-closing, and extensive piloerection. Prior treatment of pups with alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) reduces each of the passive behaviors. The onset of passive responding during separation can be accelerated with peripheral injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>). To examine whether CRF produces its effects through a mechanism similar to that of prolonged separation, we examined the effect of administering alpha-MSH to pups injected with CRF. As expected, CRF markedly enhanced passive responding during a 60-min period of separation. alpha-MSH delivered by either intracerebroventricular infusion or intraperitoneal injection significantly reduced each of the passive behavioral responses without significantly affecting active behavior. These findings, together with previous results indicating that it is the anti-inflammatory property of alpha-MSH that is responsible for its behavioral effects during prolonged separation, suggest that peripheral CRF speeds the induction of passive responding through a mechanism involving enhanced proinflammatory activity.",M2
19490624,"Corticotropin Releasing Factor promotes breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness.INTRODUCTION: Cancer cells secrete bioactive peptides that act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion affecting tumor growth and metastasis. Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), a hypothalamic neuropeptide that controls the response to stress, has been detected in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. CRF can affect breast cancer cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner via its production from innervating sympathetic neurons or immune cells. METHODS: In the present study we report our findings regarding the impact of CRF on breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness. For this purpose we used the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and evaluated the effect of CRF on motility and invasiveness using the wound-healing and boyden-chamber assays. In addition, we measured the effect of CRF on molecules that mediate motility by western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our findings show that: 1. CRF transiently inhibited the apoptosis of MCF7 cells. 2. CRF enhanced MCF7 cell motility in a wound healing assay and their invasiveness through extracellular matrix. 3. CRF increased actin polymerization, phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), providing a potential mechanism for the observed induction of MCF7 motility. 4. CRF induced the expression of Cox-1 but not Cox-2 in MCF7 cells as well as the production of prostaglandins, factors known to promote invasiveness and metastasis. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest that CRF stimulates cell motility and invasiveness of MCF7 cells most probably via induction of FAK phosphorylation and actin filament reorganization and production of prostaglandins via Cox1. Based on these findings we postulate that the stress neuropeptide CRF present in the vicinity of tumors (either produced locally by the tumor cells themselves or by nearby normal cells or secreted from the innervations of surrounding tissues) may play an important role on breast tumor growth and metastatic capacity, providing a potential link between stress and tumor progression.",M2
19483318,"The alleviating pain effect of aqueous extract from tong-xie-yao-fang, on experimental visceral hypersensitivity and its mechanism.Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang (TXYF) is a prescription in traditional chinese medicine (TCM), used for relieving abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and mechanism of TXYF on experimental visceral hypersensitivity (VH) models. TXYF affected the abdominal withdrawal reflex produced by colonic distention in maternal separation-induced visceral hypersensitivity rats, in a dosage-dependent manner. TXYF significantly decreased serotonin (5-HT) levels in serum and corticotrophin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) concentrations in the brain. Moreover, it was found that VH alleviation by TXYF was dependent on the substance P (SP) expression in the colon mucosa. These results suggest that TXYF attenuates behavioral hyperalgesia by regulating substance associated with the brain-gut axis, including decreasing the expression of 5-HT and SP in the periphery and that of CRF in the center.",M2
19481009,"Identification of brain target neurons using a fluorescent conjugate of corticotropin-releasing factor.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) is a peptide well known for its role in coordinating various neuroendocrine, autonomic, and behavioral components of the vertebrate stress response, including rapid enhancement of locomotor activity. Although CRF's locomotor enhancing properties are well documented, the neuronal mechanisms and specific target neurons that underlie the peptide's effect on locomotor behavior remain poorly understood. In the present study, we describe the synthesis and functional characteristics of a CRF rhodamine analogue TAMRA-X conjugate mixture (CRF-TAMRA 1), to be used for tracking this peptide's internalization into target neurons in the brainstem of an amphibian, the roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa). CRF-TAMRA 1 conjugate administration into the lateral cerebral ventricle resulted in a rapid, endosomal-like internalization of fluorescence into brainstem medullary neurons. In addition, central CRF-TAMRA 1 administration produced neurobehavioral effects comparable to the native peptide, effects that were blocked by pre-treatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF. Taken together, our results show the efficacy of CRF-TAMRA 1 as a novel tool for tracking CRF internalization into targets neurons in vivo and ultimately, aiding in elucidating the neuronal mechanisms and circuitry underlying CRF's influence on behavioral and physiological responses to stress.",M2
19477189,"The effect of <e>CRF</e> and alpha-helical CRF((9-41)) on rat fear responses and amino acids release in the central nucleus of the amygdala.The effects of intracerebroventricular injections of CRF and a non-selective CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF((9-41)), on the release of glutamate, aspartate, and GABA in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), were examined in the course of testing rat anxiety-like behaviour in the conditioned fear test (a freezing response), using the microdialysis technique. It was found that CRF (1 microg/rat), given to animals exposed to the stress of novelty only, insignificantly increased the glutamate concentration in the CeA, up to 200% of the control level. In the fear-conditioned animals, the influence of CRF on the local concentration of aspartate, glutamate, and Glu/GABA ratio was much more pronounced (up to a 400% increase above the baseline level of aspartate concentration), preceded an increased expression of anxiety-like responses, and appeared as early as 15 min after the drug administration. The intracerebroventricular administration of alpha-helical CRF((9-41)) (10 microg/rat) significantly decreased the rat freezing responses and increased the local concentration of GABA during the first 30 min of observation. In sum, these are new findings, which show an important role of CRF in the CeA in the regulation of fear-controlled amino acids release and suggest an involvement of amino acids in the central nucleus of the amygdala in the effects of this neurohormone on the expression of conditioned fear.",M2
19458224,"Chronic cocaine enhances corticotropin-releasing factor-dependent potentiation of excitatory transmission in ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons.Current concepts suggest that stress-induced release of neuromodulators such as corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) can drive drug-dependent behaviors. Although previous drug exposure can enhance behavioral and neurochemical responses to stress, it is unclear how such drug exposure alters the CRF modulation of excitatory synapses onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, a key locus of drug- and stress-induced neuroadaptation. Here, we demonstrate that, after repeated cocaine exposure, the magnitude and duration of the CRF-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission was significantly increased compared with naive and saline-treated mice. Furthermore, CRF enhanced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated transmission only in mice that were exposed to cocaine. Increased frequency of AMPAR-mediated spontaneous miniature EPSCs and the intracellular blockade of CRF potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission suggest both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of CRF. Importantly, pharmacological experiments revealed that CRF receptor 1 and protein kinase A pathways were newly recruited after repeated cocaine for the enhancement of CRF-induced NMDAR potentiation and the appearance of AMPAR potentiation. Thus, enhanced CRF-induced potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission onto VTA dopamine neurons after cocaine preexposure is likely to produce an abnormal increase in dopamine release during stressful events and could augment activation of addictive behaviors in response to stress.",M2
19456363,"Interplay of the endocannabinoid system with neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor in the goldfish forebrain.Based on pharmacological, behavioral, and neuroanatomical studies, the endocannabinoid system appears to be pivotal in some neuroendocrine mechanisms, such as modulation of vertebrate reproduction, stress, and food intake. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the control of the feeding response in the goldfish. By means of immunohistochemistry techniques, using anti-CB1 cannabinoid receptor, anti-corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), and anti-neuropeptide Y (NPY) antisera on brain sections of Carassius auratus, we found a topographical co-distribution of the three signaling molecules through the preoptic area and posterior lobes of the hypothalamus and even a co-localization of CB1 and NPY in the telencephalon. Previous results have shown that food deprivation in goldfish is accompanied by a significant increase of anandamide (AEA) levels in the telencephalon and AEA causes a dose-dependent effect on food intake. We have thus investigated the possible influence of intraperitoneal AEA injections on NPY expression. Our results indicate an interplay between the endocannabinoid system and orexigenic and anorexigenic molecules, such as NPY and, possibly, CRF.",M2
19456342,"Evolution of complementary peptide systems: teneurin C-terminal-associated peptides and corticotropin-releasing factor superfamilies.In chordates, the corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) family of peptides consists of four paralogous lineages that include CRF, urocortin/urotensin-I, urocortin 2, and urocortin 3. Related to the CRF peptide family is the diuretic hormone family found in insects. This family consists of a number of paralogous lineages within the Insecta. The teneurin C-terminal-associated peptides (TCAP) are a recently described family of peptides with evolutionary origins around the same time as the CRF family. This family consists of four independent lineages in chordates that are orthologous to peptides in the Insecta. Like CRF, the peptides are 40 or 41 amino acids in length and share about 20% sequence identity to the CRF family members. Each of the four TCAP peptides is encoded by an exon that is closely associated with the teneurin gene. Recent studies indicate that TCAP can block CRF-mediated c-fos expression in the brain and modulate CRF-mediated behaviors. Thus, the TCAP family may act, in part, to modulate the physiological actions of the CRF family.",M2
19439178,"Activation of corticotropin-releasing factor 2 receptor inhibits Purkinje neuron P-type calcium currents via G(o)alpha-dependent PKC epsilon pathway.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) receptors have been demonstrated to be widely expressed in the central nervous system and in many peripheral tissues of mammalians. However, it is still unknown whether CRF receptors will function in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In the present study, we investigated the expression profile of CRF receptors in rat cerebellum and identified a novel functional role of CRFR2 in modulating Purkinje neuron P-type Ca(2+) currents (P-currents). We found that CRFR2alpha mRNA, but not CRFR1 and CRFR2beta, was endogenously expressed in rat cerebellum. Activation of CRFR2 by UCN2 inhibited P-currents in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) approximately 0.07 microM). This inhibitory effect was abolished by astressin2B, a CRFR2 antagonist, and was blocked by GDP-beta-S, pertussis toxin, or a selective antibody raised against the G(o)alpha. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) blocked the inhibitory action of UCN2. The application of diacylglycerol (DAG) antagonist, 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, as well as inhibition of either protein kinase C or its epsilon isoform (PKCepsilon) abolished the UCN2 effect while 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (EI-150), a membrane-permeable DAG analogue, occluded UCN2-mediated inhibition. In addition, UCN2 significantly increases spontaneous firing frequency of Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices. In summary, activation of CRFR2 inhibits P-currents in Purkinje neurons via G(o)alpha-dependent PLC/PKCepsilon pathway, which might contribute to its physiological functions in the cerebellum.",M2
19429103,"Urocortin 2 protects against retinal degeneration following bilateral common carotid artery occlusion in the rat.Urocortin 2 (Ucn 2) is corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) paralog that preferentially activates CRF(2) receptors. Ucns exert CRF(2)-mediated cytoprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiomyocytes. However, little is known regarding potential retinoprotective effects of Ucns despite the known presence of CRF family peptides and their receptors (predominantly CRF(2 alpha)) in retina. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of post-ischemic intravitreal Ucn 2 (2 nmol) administration on ischemia-induced retinal degeneration. Two-month-old rats were subjected to permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, and their retinas were processed histologically after two weeks survival to determine the density of viable cells in the ganglion cell layer and the thickness of all retinal layers. In vehicle-treated subjects, carotid occlusion reduced retina thickness by approximately 60% as compared to sham-operated animals. In contrast, intraocular Ucn 2 treatment led to a marked amelioration of the retinal layers, and the thickness of all layers was significantly increased by 40% compared to ischemic vehicle-treated subjects. Ucn 2 treatment also increased the number of cells by 55% in the ganglion cell layer as compared to those from carotid-occluded retinas of vehicle-treated subjects. These findings suggest that intraocular Ucn 2 treatment may protect against ischemia-induced retinal degeneration, results with potential therapeutic implications for ophthalmic diseases.",M2
19429102,"Acoustic stimulation in vivo and corticotropin-releasing factor in vitro increase tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the rat caudal dorsal raphe nucleus.Exposure of rats to unpredictable loud sound pulses increases activity of the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in the median raphe nucleus (MnR) and a mesolimbocortical serotonergic system. Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)-induced activation of a subset of serotonergic neurons in the caudal dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) may underlie stress-related increases in TPH activity in the MnR and a mesolimbocortical serotonergic system. An in vivo acoustic stimulation paradigm and an in vitro brain slice preparation were designed to test the hypothesis that stress-related stimuli and CRF receptor activation have convergent actions on TPH activity in the caudal DR (DRC). We measured 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulation as an index of TPH activity following inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (using NSD-1015). To examine effects of acoustic stimulation on TPH activity, male Wistar rats, pretreated with NSD-1015, were exposed to a 30 min sham, predictable or unpredictable acoustic stimulation paradigm; brains were frozen and microdissected for analyses of tissue 5-HTP concentrations in subregions of the DR. To examine the effect of CRF receptor activation on TPH activity, freshly prepared brain slices were exposed to CRF (0-2000 nM) for 10 min in the presence of NSD-1015, then frozen and microdissected for analysis of tissue 5-HTP concentrations. Increases in TPH activity in the DRC, but not other subregions, were observed in both paradigms. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that stress-related increases in TPH activity are mediated via effects of CRF or CRF-related neuropeptides on a mesolimbocortical serotonergic system originating in the DRC.",M2
19429056,"Post-weaning social isolation alters anxiety-related behavior and neurochemical gene expression in the brain of male prairie voles.Stressful social experiences early in life, such as maternal separation and social isolation, have enduring effects on the development of the brain and behavior. In the present study in socially monogamous male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), we found that following 6 weeks of social isolation after weaning males spent more time in the closed arms and less time in the open arms during an elevated plus maze (EPM) test, moved more frequently from central to peripheral squares in an open field test, and diminished their preferences for the empty chamber during a two-chamber affiliation test, compared to control males that were housed with siblings. This increased behavioral anxiety in socially isolated males was also associated with enhanced mRNA expression for vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OT), corticotrophin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Together, these data illustrate the importance of the post-weaning social environment on anxiety-related behavior and suggest a potential role of neurochemical systems in the PVN in the regulation of this behavior.",M2
19429023,"Chronic restraint stress has no more stimulatory effects on colonic motility in rats.Previous studies have shown that acute stress stimulates colonic motor function via a central corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in rodents. However, little is known whether colonic motility is altered following chronic stress. We studied the changes of colonic motor function in response to chronic stress or daily administration of CRF in rats. Rats were subjected to restraint stress for 90 min for 5 consecutive days (chronic stress). Another group of rats received intracisternal (IC)-injection of CRF (1 microg) for 5 consecutive days. At the 1st day of restraint stress, calculated motility index was significantly increased by over 200% of basal in the proximal and distal colon. Similar results were obtained in response to the 2nd and 3rd day of restraint stress. In contrast, at the 5th day, restraint stress caused no more significant increase of colonic motility. Similarly, accelerated colonic transit induced by acute stress was no more observed following chronic stress. Increased, colonic motility and accelerated colonic transit induced by CRF were not attenuated at the 5th day. It is suggested that adaptation mechanism is developed following chronic stress. The decrease in colonic motor function in chronic stress is not due to reduced sensitivity to central CRF.",M2
19428773,"In vivo evidence for ligand-specific receptor activation in the central <e>CRF</e> system, as measured by local cerebral glucose utilization.Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is well known for its role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and its involvement in stress and anxiety. CRF acts via two main receptor subtypes, CRF(1) and CRF(2). Other endogenous CRF-related peptide ligands are the Urocortins 1 and 2 and Stresscopin. While CRF is thought to mediate its anxiogenic-like properties through CRF(1), the role of CRF(2) and its endogenous ligands Urocortin 2 and Stresscopin are less clear, with a suggested role in mediating the delayed effects of stress. Measurement of local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) provides an estimate of neuronal activity, and is of potential use as a translational tool in comparison to FDG PET. We hypothesized that comparison of the patterns of metabolic changes induced by CRF-related peptides could provide further information on their role in the brain. The present studies examined the effects of CRF-related peptides on LCGU, and the role of CRF(1) and CRF(2) in the CRF-induced LCGU response. CRF induced increases in LCGU in hypothalamic, thalamic, cerebellar and hippocampal regions, and further studies using antagonists or mutant mice lacking a functional CRF(1) receptor clearly suggested a role for CRF(2) in this effect. Urocortin 1 increased LCGU in a dissected hindbrain region. However, central administration of the CRF(2)-selective agonists Urocortin 2 and Stresscopin failed to affect LCGU, which may suggest ligand-dependent receptor activation within the CRF system. The present data supports a role for CRF(2) in the regulation of neuronal glucose metabolism.",M2
19428634,"Teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP)-1 attenuates corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>)-induced c-Fos expression in the limbic system and modulates anxiety behavior in male Wistar rats.The teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAPs) are a novel family of four endogenous peptides that have previously shown bioactive properties both in vitro and in vivo. Previously we have shown that repeated intracerebral injections of synthetic TCAP-1 modulate anxiety-like behaviors in three tests of anxiety, although the neural substrates responsible for these effects were previously unknown. In the current study, we examined both c-Fos induction and behavioral responses in the elevated plus maze and open field tests after a single intracerebroventricular dose of TCAP-1 followed by an intracerebroventricular injection of CRF in male Wistar rats. The results indicate that TCAP-1 injection attenuated the CRF-induced increase in c-Fos expression in the limbic system and many of the areas associated with the behavioral responses to stress, including the hippocampus, central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Other areas, such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial nucleus of the amygdala, and locus coeruleus, displayed CRF-induced c-Fos levels that were unaffected by TCAP-1. Furthermore, TCAP-1 administration increased stretched-attend postures, a type of risk-assessment behavior, on the elevated plus maze. These results indicate that TCAP-1 may play a potential role in the regulation of stress by blocking CRF-mediated activity in specific stress-sensitive areas of the brain.",M2
19423323,"Suppressive effect of quercetin on acute stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response in Wistar rats.The flavonoid quercetin is considered to have beneficial effects on human health. We recently have shown that quercetin-enriched foods reduced the duration of immobility time in a rat forced swimming test, indicating that dietary quercetin is promising as an antidepressant-like factor, whereas its mechanism of action is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of quercetin on water immersion-restraint (WIR), stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, which is a major component of stress response and plays an important role in the pathology of depression. Quercetin administration to rats significantly suppressed WIR stress-induced increase of plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels as well as the mRNA expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) in the hypothalamic region. In addition, quercetin modulated the DNA binding activities of glucocorticoid receptor and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in the hypothalamic region, all of which are known to regulate the expression of CRF mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that dietary quercetin attenuates the HPA axis activation by the suppression of the CRF mRNA expression.",M2
19422857,"Central administration of obestatin fails to show inhibitory effects on food and water intake in mice.Obestatin is a ghrelin-associated peptide hormone with presumed anorexigenic and inhibitory effect on gastric propulsive motility activity. Recent literature, however, discloses much contestation over satiety and gastrointestinal motility-related functionalities of obestatin. In addition, antidipsinogenic effects in rodents by obestatin were recently reported. The present study was set up to bring more clarity into the contested effects of obestatin on food and water intake. Additionally, the stability of obestatin in brain tissue homogenate was investigated. The in vitro incubation of obestatin in brain homogenates revealed disappearance half-life times of 19 min for crude brain homogenate to 27 min for brain membrane homogenate. For the behavioural studies, male C57Bl/6 mice were intracerebroventricularly treated with 0.2 nmol murine amidated obestatin or vehicle at the age of 3 months. An additional group of mice was treated with 0.3 nmol of corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) as a positive control of suppression of food intake. Food and water intake were studied over a period of 5 h in metabolic cages. Under our experimental conditions, no suppressive effects of obestatin on food or water intake were observed, whereas CRF evoked a significant suppression of food intake, which proves the internal validity of the study design.",M2

To elucidate the respective roles of these peptides under certain stressors, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular infusions of either AVP V1a receptor antagonist, [Pmp(1), Tyr (Me)(2)]- Arg(8)-Vasopressin (Pmp, Tyr-AVP) or CRH receptor antagonist, alpha-helical <e>CRF</e> 9-41 (alphahCRF) on stress responses induced by frustrating condition in sheep. Four ovariectomized Corriedale ewes were assigned to the experiment. In a  frustrating  condition (FC), food was withheld for 60 minutes from only the experimental ewe while this ewe was in the presence of the other ewes that were given food. As  non-frustrating  control condition (C), food was withheld for 60 minutes from all ewes, thereby controlling for the nonspecific effects of lack of food. FC induced a significant rise in the plasma cortisol concentration (p &lt; 0.05) and increased the pawing number and rectal temperature compared with that in C (p &lt; 0.1). The effects of either Pmp, Tyr-AVP or alphahCRF on these stress responses were analyzed. The rise in cortisol restored nearly to the control level by infusion of Pmp, Tyr-AVP or alphahCRF. The pawing number restored nearly to the control level by alphahCRF. The hyperthermia restored nearly to the control level by Pmp, Tyr-AVP. These data suggest that both endogenous CRH and AVP might be concerned with inducing physiological and behavioral stress responses to frustrating condition in sheep.",M2
19418633,"Inhibition of serotonin outflow by nociceptin/orphaninFQ in dorsal raphe nucleus slices from normal and stressed rats: Role of corticotropin releasing factor.In the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) many inputs converge and interact to modulate serotonergic neuronal activity and the behavioral responses to stress. The effects exerted by two stress-related neuropeptides, corticotropin releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and nociceptin/orphaninFQ (N/OFQ), on the outflow of [(3)H]5- hydroxytryptamine were investigated in superfused rat dorsal raphe nucleus slices. Electrical stimulation (100 mA, 1 ms for 2 min) evoked a frequency-dependent peak of [(3)H]5- hydroxytryptamine outflow, which was sodium and calcium-dependent. Corticotropin releasing factor (1-100 nM), concentration-dependently inhibited the stimulation (3 Hz)-evoked [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine outflow; the inhibition by 30 nM corticotropin releasing factor (to 68 +/- 5.7%) was prevented both by the non selective CRF receptor antagonist alpha-helicalCRF(9-41) (alpha-HEL) (300 nM) and by the CRF(1) receptor antagonist antalarmin (ANT) (100 nM). The CRF(2) agonist urocortin II (10 nM) did not modify [(3)H]5- hydroxytryptamine outflow, ruling out the involvement of CRF(2) receptors. Bicuculline (BIC), a GABAA antagonist (10 microM), prevented the inhibitory effect of corticotropin releasing factor (30 nM), supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition was mediated by increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Nociceptin/ orphaninFQ (1 nM-1 microM) exerted an antalarmin- and bicuculline-insensitive inhibition on [(3)H]5- hydroxytryptamine outflow, with the maximum at 100 nM (to 63+/- 4.2%), antagonized by the NOP receptor antagonist UFP-101 (1 microM). Dorsal raphe nucleus slices prepared from rats exposed to 15 min of forced swim stress displayed a reduced [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine outflow, in part reversed by antalarmin and further inhibited by nociceptin/orphaninFQ. These findings indicate that (i) both corticotropin releasing factor and nociceptin/orphaninFQ exert an inhibitory control on dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic neurons; (ii) the inhibition by corticotropin releasing factor involves gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons; (iii) nociceptin/ orphaninFQ inhibits dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin system in a corticotropin releasing factor- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-independent manner; (iv) nociceptin/orphaninFQ modulation is still operant in slices prepared from stressed rats. The nociceptin/orphaninFQ-NOP receptor system could represent a new target for drugs effective in stress-related disorders.",M2
19409922,"Gene-environment interactions resulting in risk alcohol drinking behaviour are mediated by <e>CRF</e> and CRF1.Both genetic and environmental influences are known to influence an individuals' vulnerability to the misuse of alcohol. One of the most relevant environmental risk factors for alcoholism is that of stress. This review aims to examine the role of the biological stress systems in the etiology of alcoholism, with a focus on corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and its receptor CRF1. CRF is reviewed in the context of the biological stress systems within which it acts such as the HPA-axis, the noradrenergic system and the central and medial amygdale. These systems are examined in more detail by reviewing their genetic and molecular components in both humans and animals. It is concluded from the findings of the studies discussed in this review that CRF has a central role in the modulation of the stress response and that genetic variations in CRF or CRF1 may confer a susceptibility to alcoholism which is, in part, mediated by life stressors. Together these neurobiological, animal and human data suggest a role for CRF when developing treatment modalities for alcoholism alongside a pharmacogenetic approach to identify subtypes of patients which would benefit from these treatments or interventions.",M2
19407218,"Cortagine, a CRF1 agonist, induces stresslike alterations of colonic function and visceral hypersensitivity in rodents primarily through peripheral pathways.Corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) 1 receptor (CRF(1)) activation in the brain is a core pathway orchestrating the stress response. Anatomical data also support the existence of CRF signaling components within the colon. We investigated the colonic response to intraperitoneal (ip) injection of cortagine, a newly developed selective CRF(1) peptide agonist. Colonic motor function and visceral motor response (VMR) were monitored by using a modified miniaturized pressure transducer catheter in adult conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice. Colonic permeability was monitored by the Evans blue method and myenteric neurons activation by Fos immunohistochemistry. Compared with vehicle, cortagine (10 microg/kg ip) significantly decreased the distal colonic transit time by 45% without affecting gastric transit, increased distal and transverse colonic contractility by 35.6 and 66.2%, respectively, and induced a 7.1-fold increase in defecation and watery diarrhea in 50% of rats during the first hour postinjection whereas intracerebroventricular (icv) cortagine (3 microg/rat) had lesser effects. Intraperitoneal (ip) cortagine also increased colonic permeability, activated proximal and distal colonic myenteric neurons, and induced visceral hypersensitivity to a second set of phasic colorectal distention (CRD). The CRF antagonist astressin (10 mug/kg ip) abolished ip cortagine-induced hyperalgesia whereas injected icv it had no effect. In mice, cortagine (30 microg/kg ip) stimulated defecation by 7.8-fold, induced 60% incidence of diarrhea, and increased VMR to CRD. Stresslike colonic alterations induced by ip cortagine in rats and mice through restricted activation of peripheral CRF(1) receptors support a role for peripheral CRF(1) signaling as the local arm of the colonic response to stress.",M2
19404572,"Long-term implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the pontine micturition centre of the Göttingen minipig.AIM: To implant deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the porcine pontine micturition centre (PMC) in order to establish a large animal model of PMC-DBS. METHOD: Brain stems from four Göttingen minipigs were sectioned coronally into 40-mum-thick histological sections and stained with Nissl, auto-metallographic myelin stain, tyrosine hydroxylase and corticotrophin-releasing factor immunohistochemistry in order to identify the porcine PMC. DBS electrodes were then stereotaxically implanted on the right side into the PMC in four Göttingen minipigs, and the bladder response to electrical stimulation was evaluated by subsequent cystometry performed immediately after the operation and several weeks later. FINDINGS: A paired <e>CRF</e>-dense area homologous to the PMC in other species was encountered in the rostral pontine tegmentum medial to the locus coeruleus and ventral to the floor of the fourth ventricle. Electrical stimulation of the CRF-dense area resulted in an increased detrusor pressure followed by visible voiding in some instances. The pigs were allowed to survive between 14 and 55 days, and electrical stimulation resulting in an increased detrusor pressure was performed on more than one occasion without affecting consciousness or general thriving. None of the pigs developed postoperative infections or died prematurely. CONCLUSIONS: DBS electrodes can be implanted for several weeks in the identified CRF-dense area resulting in a useful large animal model for basic research on micturition and the future clinical use of this treatment modality in neurogenic supra-pontine voiding disorders.",M2
19395554,"Cardiovascular responses to microinjections of urocortins into the NTS: role of inotropic glutamate receptors.Urocortin 1 (Ucn1) and urocortin 3 (Ucn3) are new members of the corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) peptide family. Ucn1 is a ligand for both the CRF type 1 receptors (CRF(1)Rs) and the CRF type 2 receptors (CRF(2)Rs), whereas Ucn3 is a high-affinity ligand for the CRF(2)Rs. Recently, we reported that Ucn3 microinjections into the medial nucleus tractus solitarius (mNTS) elicit decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) (Nakamura T, Kawabe K, Sapru HN. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 296: H325-H332, 2009). The presence of CRF(2)Rs on afferent terminals has been reported in the mNTS of the rat. It was hypothesized that activation of CRF(2)Rs on afferent terminals in the mNTS may release glutamate, which, in turn, may elicit decreases in MAP and HR via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLURs). This hypothesis was tested in urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated, adult male Wistar rats. Microinjections (100 nl) of Ucn1 (0.12 mM) into the mNTS elicited decreases in MAP and HR. The responses were partially blocked by microinjections of iGLUR antagonists into the mNTS. On the other hand, the decreases in MAP and HR elicited by microinjections of Ucn3 (0.06 mM) into the mNTS were completely blocked by microinjections of iGLUR antagonists into the mNTS. These results indicate that activation of CRF(2)Rs in the mNTS, by Ucn1 and Ucn3, releases glutamate, which, in turn, elicits decreases in MAP and HR via activation of iGLURs.",M2
19395447,"The effects of apelin on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis neuroendocrine function are mediated through corticotrophin-releasing factor- and vasopressin-dependent mechanisms.The apelinergic system has a widespread expression in the central nervous system (CNS) including the paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and median eminence, and isolated cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. This pattern of expression in hypothalamic nuclei known to contain corticotrophin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) and vasopressin (AVP) and to co-ordinate endocrine responses to stress has generated interest in a role for apelin in the modulation of stress, perhaps via the regulation of hormone release from the pituitary. In this study, to determine whether apelin has a central role in the regulation of CRF and AVP neurones, we investigated the effect of i.c.v. administration of pGlu-apelin-13 on neuroendocrine function in male mice pre-treated with the CRF receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRF(9-41), and in mice-lacking functional AVP V1b receptors (V1bR KO). Administration of pGlu-apelin-13 (1 mg/kg i.c.v.) resulted in significant increases in plasma ACTH and corticosterone (CORT), which were significantly reduced by pre-treatment with alpha-helical CRF(9-41), indicating the involvement of a CRF-dependent mechanism. Additionally, pGlu-apelin-13-mediated increases in both plasma ACTH and CORT were significantly attenuated in V1bR KO animals when compared with wild-type controls, indicating a role for the vasopressinergic system in the regulation of the effects of apelin on neuroendocrine function. Together, these data confirm that the in vivo effects of apelin on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal neuroendocrine function appear to be mediated through both CRF- and AVP-dependent mechanisms.",M2
19409390,"Fluoxetine potentiates the effects of corticotropin-releasing factor on locomotor activity and serotonergic systems in the roughskin newt, Taricha granulosa.The anxiety- and stress-related neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (<e>CRF</e>) elicits behavioral changes in vertebrates including increases in behavioral arousal and locomotor activity. Intracerebroventricular injections of CRF in an amphibian, the roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa), induces rapid increases in locomotor activity in both intact and hypophysectomized animals. We hypothesized that this CRF-induced increase in locomotor activity involves a central effect of CRF on serotonergic neurons, based on known stimulatory actions of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) on spinal motor neurons and the central pattern generator for locomotor activity in vertebrates. In Experiment 1, we found that neither intracerebroventricular injections of low doses of CRF (25 ng) nor the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10, 100 ng), by themselves, altered locomotor activity. In contrast, newts treated concurrently with CRF and fluoxetine responded with marked increases in locomotor activity. In Experiment 2, we found that increases in locomotor activity following co-administration of CRF (25 ng) and fluoxetine (100 ng) were associated with decreased 5-HT concentrations in a number of forebrain structures involved in regulation of emotional behavior and emotional states, including the ventral striatum, amygdala pars lateralis, and dorsal hypothalamus, measured 37 min after treatment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CRF stimulates locomotor activity through activation of serotonergic systems.",M2
19409389,"Urotensin I-<e>CRF</e>-Urocortins: a mermaid's tail.From the individual perspective of the two authors who were long-time colleagues of Karl Lederis at the University of Calgary, the events and personal interactions are described, that are relevant to the discovery of Urotensin I (UI) in the Lederis laboratory, along with the concurrent discovery of Urotensin II (UII) in the Bern laboratory and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF/CRH) in the Vale laboratory. The fortuitous sabbatical experiences that put Professors Lederis and Bern on the track of the Urotensins, along with the essential isolation paradigm that resulted in the complete sequencing and synthesis of UI and UII are summarized. The chance interaction between Drs. Vale and Lederis who, prior to the publications of the sequences of UI and CRF, realized the sequence commonalities of these peptides with the vasoactive frog peptide, sauvagine, is outlined. Further, the relationship between the pharmacological studies done with UI in the Calgary laboratory and the more recent understanding of the biology and receptor pharmacology for the entire Urotensin I-CRF-Urocortin peptide family is dealt with. The value of a comparative endocrinology approach to understanding hormone action is emphasized, along with a projection to the future, based on new hypotheses that can be generated by unexplained data already in the literature. Based on the previously described pharmacology of the UI-CRF-Urocortin peptides in a number of target tissues, it is suggested that the use of current molecular approaches can be integrated with a 'classical' pharmacological approach to generate new insights about the UI-CRF-Urocortin hormone family.",M2
