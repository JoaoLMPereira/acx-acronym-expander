20499996,"Preparation of degradable polymeric nanocapsules from hyperbranched poly (amine ester) grafted nanosilica templates.A facile approach for the preparation of degradable crosslinked polymeric nanocapsules with hydroxyl functional groups was developed by polycondensation from the nanosilica templates. The hyperbranched poly (amine ester) grafted silica nanoparticles (SN-HPAE) were crosslinked with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). Then the silica templates were removed by HF etching to produce the degradable polymeric nanocapsules. The inner diameter of polymeric nanocapsules is in the range of 20-100 nm, which is characterised by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). The strategy developed was confirmed with Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis and TEM.",M1
20499995,"Synthesis, stabilisation and characterisation of rhamnolipid-capped ZnS nanoparticles in aqueous medium.Capping agents stabilise the size of the nanoparticles in the range of 1-10 nm. Microbial surfactants as capping agents are beneficial replacements for chemically synthesised ones because of lower toxicity. Rhamnolipids are surfactants produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, having high affinity for metal ions. In this study, the authors used rhamnolipids for capping ZnS nanoparticles. The capped particles were stabilised in aqueous environment and its characteristics were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-<e>TEM</e>) and ultraviolet-visible spectra, fluorescence spectra. The particle Bohr radius was found to be 4.5 nm both by SAXS and HRTEM, thus proving rhamnolipid to be an effective capping agent for the synthesis of uniform nanoparticles. SAXS study not only reveals the particle size and distribution but also its self-affined agglomeration behaviour. This work is a novel method for stabilising nanoparticles in aqueous condition using biosurfactant.",M1
20471605,"Catechol derivatives inhibit the fibril formation of amyloid-beta peptides.The inhibition of fibril formation of amyloid beta proteins (A beta) would be attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dopamine (DA) and other catechol derivatives were used as inhibitory factors for A beta fibril formation. The fibril formation of A beta was monitored by Thioflavin T fluorescence, a transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Catechol and its derivatives showed the dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the spontaneous A beta fibril formation. The inhibitory activity depended on the chemical structure of catechol derivatives both in the presence and absence of the liposome a model of biomembrane. Formation of catechol quinone-conjugated-A beta adduct by a Schiff-base is a key step for the inhibition effect of A beta fibril formation.",M1
20459055,"An efficient bismuth tungstate visible-light-driven photocatalyst for breaking down nitric oxide.This paper reports a photocatalytic removal of 400 ppb level of NO in air under visible light irradiation by utilizing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical bismuth tungstate (Bi(2)WO(6)) microspheres. A facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving bismuth nitrate and sodium wolframate was developed to synthesize the photocatalyst. The Bi(2)WO(6) samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and ultraviolet-visible reflectance (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The relationship between the physicochemical property and the photocatalytic performance of the as prepared samples is discussed. The present work demonstrates that the 3D hierarchical Bi(2)WO(6) microspheres are effective visible-light-driven photocatalytic functional materials for air purification.",M1
20443746,"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis: an ultrastructural study before and after osteosynthesis.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several different theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Using transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), we carried out an ultrastructural study of core biopsy specimens of the physis at various stages of the disease. METHODS: Core biopsies were performed in 6 patients with different forms of SCFE during the first operation, and in 3 of them when removing the osteosynthesis material before physeal closure. The specimens were prepared for TEM examination. RESULTS: In 6 specimens obtained at first surgery, a marked distortion of the physeal architecture was observed. In 2 of the 3 specimens obtained at removal of the osteosynthesis material, the physis showed a more normal organization. INTERPRETATION: The improvement of the pathological alterations observed in the 2 cases after surgical intervention leads us to consider the possibility that when the growth plate is stabilized directly by pinning or indirectly by creating more optimal loading conditions with an intertrochanteric osteotomy, the morpho-functional characteristics of the physis can be restored and its growth process may resume.",M1
20423134,"Polymer-derived ceramic composite fibers with aligned pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes.Polymer-derived ceramic fibers with aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are fabricated through the electrospinning of polyaluminasilazane solutions with well-dispersed MWCNTs followed by pyrolysis. Poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly (poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (P3HT-b-PPEGA), a conjugated block copolymer compatible with polyaluminasilazane, is used to functionalize MWCNT surfaces with PPEGA, providing a noninvasive approach to disperse carbon nanotubes in polyaluminasilazane chloroform solutions. The electrospinning of the MWCNT/polyaluminasilazane solutions generates polymer fibers with aligned MWCNTs where MWCNTs are oriented along the electrospun jet by a sink flow. The subsequent pyrolysis of the obtained composite fibers produces ceramic fibers with aligned MWCNTs. The study of the effect of polymer and CNT concentration on the fiber structures shows that the fiber size increases with the increment of polymer concentration, whereas higher CNT content in the polymer solutions leads to thinner fibers attributable to the increased conductivity. Both the SEM and <e>TEM</e> characterization of the polymer and ceramic fibers demonstrates the uniform orientation of CNTs along the fibers, suggesting excellent dispersion of CNTs and efficient CNT alignment via the electrospinning. The electrical conductivity of a ceramic fibers with 1.2% aligned MWCNTs is measured to be 1.58 x 10(-6) S/cm, which is more than 500 times higher than that of bulk ceramic (3.43 x 10(-9) S/cm). Such an approach provides a versatile method to disperse CNTs in preceramic polymer solutions and offers a new approach to integrate aligned CNTs in ceramics.",M1
20423123,"Well-defined PMMA brush on silica particles fabricated by surface-initiated photopolymerization (SIPP).The photochemical method is a convenient and simple way to synthesize the polymer brush on surface. We presented here a facile approach to fabricate PMMA brush on silica particles (SPs) by combination of self-assembly monolayer of hyperbranched polymeric thioxanthone (HPTX) and surface-initiated photopolymerization (SIPP). HPTX was immobilized on the surface of silica particles (SPs) through nucleophilic addition between amine and epoxy groups, and then initiated photopolymerization of MMA to generate PMMA brush on SPs at room temperature. The whole process was well-traced by FT-IR, TGA, SEM, and <e>TEM</e>. The results show that it is easy to create PMMA brushes of tunable thickness under UV irradiation. Especially, TEM images reveal the obvious formation of well-defined hybrid particles with SPs as the core and PMMA layers as the shell. The obtained hybrid particles can be implanted into PMMA matrix to produce PMMA composite with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties.",M1
20409218,"Morphological sperm defects analyzed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy and their correlation with sperm motility.OBJECTIVES: To compare sperm defects as assessed by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), and to correlate them with sperm motility. METHODS: A cohort of 40 male partners of infertile couples was selected. Group 1 (n = 31) included subjects with motility &gt;5 and &lt;50%, group 2 (n = 9) included those with motility &lt;5% and the control group consisted of 10 normospermic subjects. Semen analysis of morphological parameters was carried out by LM and TEM. RESULTS: A linear correlation between LM and TEM regarding head defects and excess residual cytoplasm (r = 0.87 and 0.90) was found, whereas there was a poor correlation between tail and midpiece anomalies (r = 0.46 and 0.21). No significant variations were detected by LM and TEM regarding sperm head defects and excess residual cytoplasm, whereas TEM showed a significantly greater percentage of tail and midpiece alterations compared with LM in groups 1 and 2, as well as controls (P &lt; 0.05). The microtubular pattern '&lt;9 + 2' represented the most frequent axonemal morphological alteration. CONCLUSIONS: TEM might represent an additional diagnostic tool in the presence of severe sperm hypomotility or absence of motility.",M1
20407714,"Lipid coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles as photosensitive drug carriers.This paper presents a strategy for the biofunctionalization of novel photosensitizer carriers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). After being calcined and absorbed with photosensitizers (hypocrellin B, HB), MSNs can be coated with a lipid layer. Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results proved that HB molecules can be loaded into MSN porous and lipid can coated on the surface of the nanoparticles. When co-cultured with cancer cells (MCF-7), MSNs can transport HB molecules into cells and present low cytotoxicity. With the introduction of a lipid layer, the efficiency of MSN uptake by cells can be improved. These intracellular HB-loaded MSN materials also present cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells after light irradiation which indicates the materials can be used as good photosensitizer carriers in photodynamic therapy.",M1
20398382,"Microvessel changes after post-ischemic benign and malignant hyperemia: experimental study in rats.BACKGROUND: The present investigation was designed to elucidate the use of dynamic contrast enhanced perfusion MR imaging (DCE pMRI) in characterizing hyperemia, including microvessel changes, and to examine whether DCE pMRI can predict benign or malignant hyperemia. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by intraluminal suture placement. All rats were randomized to 4 groups: MCAO for 0.5 hours followed by saline treatment (10 ml/kg; group 1); MCAO for 3 hours followed by treatment with saline (group 2) or urokinase (25000 IU/kg; group 3); and MCAO for 6 hours followed by urokinase treatment (group 4). Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative maximum slope of increase of the signal intensity time curve (rMSI) were quantitatively analyzed from MRI. Microvessel diameter and blood-brain barrier disruption obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) as well as transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) were obtained for correlative study. RESULTS: Benign hyperemia was noticed only in group 1; malignant hyperemia was seen in group 3. Although the rCBV of malignant hyperemia was slightly higher than in benign hyperemia (P &gt; 0.05), the rMSI, on the other hand, was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05). Fluoro-isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) extravasations, marked glial end-foot process swelling, and significant vasodilatation were seen in malignant hyperemia, while no or mild leakage of FITC-dextran and slight glial end-foot process swelling occurred in benign hyperemia. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that DCE pMRI can characterize post-ischemic hyperemia and correlates well with microvascular damage.",M1
20390890,"Catalytic oxidation of 2-Propanol over (Cr,Mn,Fe)-Pt/gamma-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts and modeling of experimental results by artificial neural networks.The catalytic activity of transition metals (Cr,Mn,Fe) supported on the Pt/gamma -Al(2)O(3) industrial catalyst was investigated to bring about the complete oxidation of 2-Propanol. Catalytic studies were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed reactor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and ICP-AES techniques were used to characterize a series of catalysts. Results showed that the Pt-Mn/gamma -Al(2)O(3) (3.88 wt.%Mn) at calcination temperature of 300 degrees C was the most promising catalyst based on activity, which might be contributed to the quantity of manganese loading, the favorable synergetic effects between Pt and Mn and the well-dispersed bimetallic phase. An artificial neural networks (ANN) model was developed to predict the performance of catalytic oxidation process over Pt-Mn/gamma -Al(2)O(3) bimetallic catalyst based on experimental data. For this purpose the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithm was employed to train the model by using laboratory experimental data. A comparison between the predicted results of the designed ANN model and experimental data was also conducted. The developed model can describe the catalytic oxidation over bimetallic catalysts under different conditions.",M1
20384368,"Novel type of bicellar disks from a mixture of DMPC and DMPE-DTPA with complexed lanthanides.We report on the formation of bicelles from a mixture of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and the chelator-lipid dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DMPE-DTPA) with complexed lanthanides, either thulium (Tm(3+)) or lanthanum (La(3+)). The two phospholipids used have the same acyl-chain length but differ in headgroup size and chemical structure. The total lipid concentration was 15 mM, and the molar ratio of DMPC to DMPE-DTPA was 4:1. The system was studied with small angle neutron scattering (SANS) in a magnetic field, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-<e>TEM</e>), and (31)P NMR spectroscopy. We found that, after appropriate preparation steps, that is, extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane followed by a cooling step, monodisperse small unilamellar disks (flat cylinders called bicelles) are formed. They have a radius of 20 nm and a bilayer thickness of about 4 nm and are stable in the investigated temperature range of 2.5-30 degrees C. Fitting of SANS data with a form factor for partly aligned flat cylinders shows that the bicelles are slightly orientable in a magnetic field of 8 T if DMPE-DTPA is complexed with Tm(3+).",M1
20384335,"Temperature sensitivity of black carbon decomposition and oxidation.Global warming accelerates decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools with varying rates and temperature sensitivities. Black carbon (BC) materials are among the slowest decomposing components of the SOC pool. Although BC is a large component of SOC in many systems, the influence of temperature on decomposition of BC bearing different chemical and physical structures remains poorly understood. Four BC materials, produced by carbonizing corn residue and oak wood at 350 and 600 degrees C (corn-350-BC, corn-600-BC, oak-350-BC, and oak-600-BC), were mixed with pure sand and incubated at 4, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C for 1 year. Corn-BC was more porous than oak-BC as determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Increasing the charring temperature from 350 to 600 degrees C led to greater aromaticity with 5-15% more C in aromatic rings and a 39-57% increase in both nonprotonated aromatic C and aromatic bridgehead C quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and a greater degree of order and development of C layers as observed by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). With a temperature increase from 4 to 60 degrees C, C loss of corn-350-BC increased from 10 to 20%, corn-600-BC, from 4 to 20%, oak-350-BC, from 2.3 to 15%, and oak-600-BC from 1.5 to 14% of initial C content, respectively. Temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) decreased with increasing incubation temperature and was highest in oak-600-BC, followed by oak-350-BC, corn-600-BC, and corn-350-BC, indicating that decomposition of more stable BC was more sensitive to increased temperature than less stable materials. Carbon loss and potential cation exchange capacity (CECp) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) correlated with O/C ratios and change in O/C ratios, suggesting that oxidative processes were the most important mechanism controlling BC decomposition in this study.",M1
20383370,"Spectroscopic determination of the size of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles formed under environmentally relevant conditions.A multi-technique approach was adopted using UV/visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) in the characterization of cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles. CdS nanoparticle sizes could be determined by the Brus equation, which relates the UV/vis spectroscopic properties of CdS nanoparticles to size based on the quantum confinement effect. The diameters calculated from the wavelength of absorbance in UV/vis spectra were within 10% of the mean nanoparticle diameter measured in TEM. UV/vis spectroscopy provided an aqueous phase measurement of the CdS core size of the nanoparticles (&lt;2 nm to approximately 10 nm diameter) that is based on a physical property rather than light scattering. CdS nanoparticles readily formed upon addition of sulfide to a Cd(ii)-thiolate complex with the thiolate molecules acting as capping agents that passivate the nanoparticle surface, thereby preventing bulk mineral precipitation. Using UV/vis as a method of nanoparticle sizing, we were able to demonstrate how aqueous conditions dictate the resulting nanoparticle size. High pH, capping thiolate concentration and Cd : S ratio all resulted in smaller nanoparticles. Ionic strength did not influence nanoparticle size, but DLS data indicate the formation of aggregates above ionic strengths of 0.1 M.",M1
20368681,"Long-term follow-up of lung biodistribution and effect of instilled SWCNTs using multiscale imaging techniques.Due to their distinctive properties, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are being more and more extensively used in nanotechnology, with prospects in nanomedicine. It would therefore appear essential to develop and apply appropriate imaging tools for detecting and evaluating their biological impacts with the prospect of medical applications or in the situation of accidental occupational exposure. It has been shown recently that raw SWCNTs with metallic impurities can be noninvasively detected in the lungs by hyperpolarized (3)helium (HP-(3)He) MRI. Moreover raw and purified SWCNTs had no acute biological effect. The purpose of the present longitudinal study was to investigate long-term follow-up by imaging, as well as chronic lung effects. In a 3-month follow-up study, multiscale imaging techniques combining noninvasive HP-(3)He and proton (H) MRI to ex vivo light (histopathological analysis) and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) were used to assess the biodistribution and biological effects of intrapulmonary instilled raw SWCNTs. Specific in vivo detection of carbon nanotubes with MRI relied on their intrinsic metal impurities. MRI also has the ability to evaluate tissue inflammation by the follow-up of local changes in signal intensity. MRI and ex vivo microscopy techniques showed that granulomatous and inflammatory reactions were produced in a time and dose dependent manner by instilled raw SWCNTs.",M1
20367054,"Relative quantification of white blood cell mitochondrial DNA and assessment of mitochondria by use of transmission electron microscopy in English Springer Spaniels with and without retinal dysplasia.OBJECTIVE: To compare relative amounts of WBC mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; assessed via real-time PCR assay) and morphology of lymphocyte mitochondria (assessed via transmission electron microscopy [<e>TEM</e>]) in blood samples collected from English Springer Spaniels with and without retinal dysplasia. ANIMALS: 7 and 5 client-owned English Springer Spaniels (1 to 11 years old) with and without retinal dysplasia, respectively. PROCEDURES: Blood samples were obtained from affected and unaffected dogs via venipuncture. Genomic DNA was extracted from WBCs of the 7 affected and 5 unaffected dogs, and relative quantification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (COX1) was determined via analysis of real-time PCR results. White blood cells from 3 affected and 4 unaffected dogs were embedded in epoxide resin for TEM; cross sections were examined for lymphocytes, which were measured. The mitochondria within lymphocytes were quantified, and the mitochondrial surface area per lymphocyte cross section was calculated. A masked technique was used to compare mitochondrial morphology between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Compared with the smallest measured quantity of mtDNA among unaffected dogs, mtDNA amounts varied among unaffected (1.08- to 4.76-fold differences) and affected dogs (1- to 2.68-fold differences). Analysis of lymphocyte measurements and mitochondrial surface area, morphology, and quantity revealed no significant differences between affected and unaffected dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: No significant differences were detected in relative amounts of WBC mtDNA or the size, number, or morphology of lymphocyte mitochondria in English Springer Spaniels affected with retinal dysplasia, compared with results for unaffected control dogs.",M1
20364851,"C-reactive protein induced rearrangement of phosphatidylcholine on nanoparticle mimics of lipoprotein particles.Lipid-coated metal nanoparticles are developed here as a mimic of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and used to study C-reactive protein (CRP) binding to highly curved lipid membranes. A 12 nm shift in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was observed when CRP was added to the lipid-coated gold nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) revealed that CRP induced a structural change to the lipids, resulting in clusters of nanoparticles. This clustering provides a visualization of how CRP could cause the aggregation of LDL particles, which is a key step in atherosclerosis. The cluster formation and resultant LSPR shift requires the presence of both CRP and calcium. Fluorescence anisotropy, using a CRP-specific, fluorophore-labeled aptamer confirmed that CRP was bound to the lipid-coated nanoparticles. An increase in the fluorescence anisotropy (Delta r = +0.261 +/- 0.004) of the aptamer probe occurs in the presence of CRP, PC-coated nanoparticles, and calcium. Subsequent sequestration of calcium by EDTA leads to a decrease in the anisotropy (Delta r = -0.233 +/- 0.011); however, there is no change in the LSPR and no change to the cluster structure observed by TEM. This indicates that CRP binds to the PC membrane on the nanoparticle surface reversibly through a calcium bridging mechanism while changing the underlying membrane structure irreversibly as a result of binding.",M1
20364237,"Early events in Populus hybrid and Fagus sylvatica leaves exposed to ozone.This paper aims to investigate early responses to ozone in leaves of Fagus sylvatica (beech) and Populus maximowiczii x Populus berolinensis (poplar). The experimental setup consisted of four open-air (OA) plots, four charcoal-filtered (CF) open-top chambers (OTCs), and four nonfiltered (NF) OTCs. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out on nonsymptomatic (CF) and symptomatic (NF and OA) leaves of both species. Qualitative analyses were performed applying microscopic techniques: Evans blue staining for detection of cell viability, CeCl3 staining of transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>) samples to detect the accumulation of H2O2, and multispectral fluorescence microimaging and microspectrofluorometry to investigate the accumulation of fluorescent phenolic compounds in the walls of the damaged cells. Quantitative analyses consisted of the analysis of the chlorophyll a fluorescence transients (fast kinetics). The early responses to ozone were demonstrated by the Evans blue and CeCl3 staining techniques that provided evidence of plant responses in both species 1 month before foliar symptoms became visible. The fluorescence transients analysis, too, demonstrated the breakdown of the oxygen evolving system and the inactivation of the end receptors of electrons at a very early stage, both in poplar and in beech. The accumulation of phenolic compounds in the cell walls, on the other hand, was a species-specific response detected in poplar, but not in beech. Evans blue and CeCl3 staining, as well as the multispectral fluorescence microimaging and microspectrofluorometry, can be used to support the field diagnosis of ozone injury, whereas the fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence provides evidence of early physiological responses.",M1
20362849,"Trypan blue staining for capsulorhexis: ultrastructural effect on lens epithelial cells and capsules.PURPOSE: To evaluate the ultrastructural effect of trypan blue 0.1% staining for capsulorhexis on lens epithelial cells (LECs) and capsules. SETTING: Division of Ophthalmology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Before capsulorhexis, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Trypan blue 0.1% staining was performed in the treatment group. No trypan blue was used in the control group. Samples of capsules with LECs were fixed and analyzed with routine optical microscopy techniques, immunohistochemistry for beclin-1 expression (a marker of autophagy), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling to detect apoptosis, and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Morphometric analyses were performed, and the 2 sets of data were compared. RESULTS: Each group comprised 15 patients. Cell death by autophagy and apoptosis was observed in the treatment group but not in the control group. The TEM images of subcapsular epithelium cells showed mitochondrial rupture, dilation of the cisterns of the endoplasmic reticulum, increased cytoplasmic and nuclear electron density, and abnormalities in the nuclear profile of trypan blue-stained cells. Morphometric analysis showed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in the longest nuclear axes and the ratio between the total nuclear perimeter and the cell area (P = .03). The difference in capsule thickness between groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: Trypan blue caused LEC death, which supports the hypothesis that staining with trypan blue 0.1% can help reduce the incidence of posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.",M1
20361517,"Bactericidal effect of HM-242, a novel disinfectant, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.The bactericidal effect of HM-242, a novel antimicrobial agent, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated by using Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values and the time-kill study. Furthermore, we also morphologically investigated its effect against P. aeruginosa by use of transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) in comparison with that of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG). The bactericidal activity of HM-242 after 1 min incubation evaluated by MBC was 25 microg/mL, while the MBC of CHG was 50 microg/mL. In the time-kill study, the killing activity of HM-242 with 25 microg/mL incubation was stronger than that of CHG with 50 microg/mL incubation. MIC values of HM-242 and CHG against P. aeruginosa were 25 microg/mL and 12.5 microg/mL, respectively. We also observed via TEM the morphological changes in the test bacteria after being treated with each drug at 1/2MBC, 1MBC, 2MBC and 4MBC after 1 min or 5 min incubation. Under treatment with the same concentration of the test drugs, the cell damage with HM-242 treatment was greater than that with CHG. The appearance of empty cells was recognized at the concentrations greater than 50 microg/mL (2MBC) of HM-242 and 200 microg/mL of CHG (4MBC) after 1 min exposure, although no cell damage was evident below these concentrations. The cell-damaging effect against the test strain was dependent on the drug concentration and incubation time. The release of cell components and bleb formation were also recognized. These results suggest that HM-242 has more potent bactericidal activity in low concentrations under shorter time treatments than CHG. Both HM-242 and CHG act on the cell membrane and cell wall of P. aeruginosa and can destroy the cell integrity. We finally emphasize that HM-242 as well as CHG might be a suitable disinfectant for use in the medical field.",M1
20361499,"Farnesol induces apoptosis and oxidative stress in the fungal pathogen Penicillium expansum.This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of farnesol (FOH) on the growth of P. expansum. The viability of P. expansum cells was determined by counting the colony forming units (CFU) after each FOH treatment. Morphological changes of FOH-treated fungal cells were analyzed by staining with Hoechst 33258, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase fluorescein-12-dUTP nick end labeling), Annexin-V FITC and the oxidant-sensitive probe H2DCFDA (dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate). FOH strongly inhibited the growth of hyphae. The hyphal cells showed the hallmarks of apoptosis including chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, caspases activation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation but without nucleosomal ladder production. The abnormal cellular ultrastructure observed by transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>) indicated that disintegration of cellular ultrastructure (especially for mitochondria) was linked to FOH-induced cell death. Taken together we demonstrated that FOH inhibits the growth of P. expansum and promotes apoptosis via activation of metacaspases, production of ROS and disintegration of cellular ultrastructure.",M1
20360769,"Preparation of cells for assessing ultrastructural localization of nanoparticles with transmission electron microscopy.We describe the use of transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) for cellular ultrastructural examination of nanoparticle (NP)-exposed biomaterials. Preparation and imaging of electron-transparent thin cell sections with TEM provides excellent spatial resolution (approximately 1 nm), which is required to track these elusive materials. This protocol provides a step-by-step method for the mass-basis dosing of cultured cells with NPs, and the process of fixing, dehydrating, staining, resin embedding, ultramicrotome sectioning and subsequently visualizing NP uptake and translocation to specific intracellular locations with TEM. In order to avoid potential artifacts, some technical challenges are addressed. Based on our results, this procedure can be used to elucidate the intracellular fate of NPs, facilitating the development of biosensors and therapeutics, and provide a critical component for understanding NP toxicity. This protocol takes approximately 1 week.",M1
20357408,"Swift heavy ion irradiation induced enhancement in the antioxidant activity and biocompatibility of polyaniline nanofibers.Polyaniline (PAni) nanofibers doped with HCl and CSA have been irradiated with 90 MeV O(7+) ions with fluence of 3 x 10(10), 3 x 10(11) and 1 x 10(12) ions cm(-2). <e>TEM</e> micrographs show a decrease in the fiber diameter with increasing irradiation fluence, which has been explained on the basis of the Coulomb explosion model. XRD analysis reveals a decrease in the crystalline domain length and an increase in the strain. The increase in d-spacing for the (100) reflection with increasing irradiation fluence is ascribed to the increase in the tilt angle of the polymer chain, which is also evident from micro-Raman spectra. UV-vis spectra of the PAni nanofibers exhibit blue-shift in the absorption bands attributed to pi-pi* band transitions indicating a reduction in particle size after SHI irradiation; as also observed in TEM micrographs. Micro-Raman spectra also reveal a transition from the benzenoid to quinoid structures in the PAni chain as the fluence is increased. Although the quinoid unit has no hydrogen for DPPH scavenging, the antioxidant activity of PAni nanofibers is found to increase with increasing fluence. This has been attributed to the availability of more reaction sites as a result of fragmentation of the PAni nanofibers which compensates for the benzenoid to quinoid transition after irradiation. The biocompatibility of the PAni nanofibers is also found to increase with increasing irradiation fluence, indicating the possibility of employing swift heavy ion irradiation as an effective technique in order to modify conducting polymer nanostructures for biomedical applications.",M1
20356566,"Anti-amyloidogenic property of leaf aqueous extract of Caesalpinia crista.Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the major etiological factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta(42) self-assembles to form oligomers and fibrils via multiple aggregation process. The recent studies aimed to decrease Abeta levels or prevention of Abeta aggregation which are the major targets for therapeutic intervention. Natural products as alternatives for AD drug discovery are a current trend. We evidenced that Caesalpinia crista leaf aqueous extract has anti-amyloidogenic potential. The studies on pharmacological properties of C. crista are very limited. Our study focused on ability of C. crista leaf aqueous extract on the prevention of (i) the formation of oligomers and aggregates from monomers (Phase I: Abeta(42)+extract co-incubation); (ii) the formation of fibrils from oligomers (Phase II: extract added after oligomers formation); and (iii) dis-aggregation of pre-formed fibrils (Phase III: aqueous extract added to matured fibrils and incubated for 9 days). The aggregation kinetics was monitored using thioflavin-T assay and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). The results showed that C. crista aqueous extract could able to inhibit the Abeta(42) aggregation from monomers and oligomers and also able to dis-aggregate the pre-formed fibrils. The study provides an insight on finding new natural products for AD therapeutics.",M1
20355703,"Adsorbed polymer and NOM limits adhesion and toxicity of nano scale zerovalent iron to E. coli.Nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) is used for groundwater remediation. Freshly synthesized bare, i.e. uncoated NZVI is bactericidal at low mg/L concentration, but the impact of surface modifiers and aging (partial oxidation) on its bactericidal properties have not been determined. Here we assess the effect that adsorbed synthetic polymers and natural organic matter (NOM) and aging (partial oxidation) have on the bactericidal properties of NZVI to the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli. Exposure to 100 mg/L of bare NZVI with 28% Fe(0) content resulted in a 2.2-log inactivation after 10 min and a 5.2-log inactivation after 60 min. Adsorbed poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), poly(aspartate) (PAP), or NOM on NZVI with the same Fe(0) content significantly decreased its toxicity, causing less than 0.2-log inactivation after 60 min. <e>TEM</e> images and heteroaggregation studies indicate that bare NZVI adheres significantly to cells and that the adsorbed polyelectrolyte or NOM prevents adhesion, thereby decreasing NZVI toxicity. The 1.8-log inactivation observed for bare NZVI with 7% Fe(0) content was lower than the 5.2-log inactivation using NZVI with 28% Fe(0) after 1 h; however, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) after 24 h was 5 mg/L regardless of Fe(0) content. The MIC of PSS, PAP, and NOM coated NZVI were much higher: 500 mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 100 mg/L, respectively. But the MIC was much lower than the typical injection concentration used in remediation (10 g/L). Complete oxidation of Fe(0) in NZVI under aerobic conditions eliminated its bactericidal effects. This study indicates that polyelectrolyte coatings and NOM will mitigate the toxicity of NZVI for exposure concentrations below 0.1 to 0.5 g/L depending on the coating and that aged NZVI without Fe(0) is relatively benign to bacteria.",M1
20355599,"Ionic liquid-based approach to monodisperse luminescent LaF3:Ce,Tb nanodiskettes: synthesis, structural and photoluminescent properties.In this paper, a novel and easy synthesis of highly luminescent, water-soluble LaF3:Ce,Tb nanodiskettes (25 nm in diameter) by ionic liquid-based hydrothermal process is reported. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were used to characterize the structural properties of the LaF3:Ce,Tb nanodiskettes. Ionic liquid [bmim]BF4 acts as both a co-solvent and a reactant during the synthesis. The effects of EDTA-2Na on the formation of green LaF3:Ce,Tb nanodiskette phosphors were studied and discussed. The luminescent properties of LaF3:Ce,Tb nanodiskettes have been investigated under 254 nm excitation both in solid state and dispersed in solution. The quantum efficiency (in solid state) is about 20% compared with commercial green phosphor. The photoluminescent properties show that the as-prepared La0.8Ce0.15Tb0.05F3 nanodiskettes may be applied as phosphors for high-resolution displays and fluorescent labels for biomolecules.",M1
20352846,"Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer/multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposites.In this study relatively large amount of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) (130 g) was melt-mixed with multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and the effect of mixing time and rotor speed on electrical properties were investigated. Also, to investigate the relationship between the degree of dispersion of MWCNT and conductivity, the dispersion of MWCNT was examined using SEM and <e>TEM</e>. At shorter mixing time (15 min), increased rotor speed produces improved conductivity, whereas at longer mixing time (25 min and 35 min) increased rotor speed leads to enhanced breakage of the MWCNT and decrease of conductivity even though the dispersion of MWCNT is improved. Therefore to obtain the best conductivity, optimal shear rate and mixing time should be chosen.",M1
20352845,"Preparation and characterization of Rh catalyst supported on nanoporous alumina for the ethylene hydroformylation.Nanoporous gamma-aluminas were prepared by a sol-gel method with and without surfactant, and characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The resulting materials were applied to Rh catalyst supports for the ethylene hydroformylation. The ordered nanoporous alumina (A-1) which was prepared using surfactant, showed well-developed pore structures with high surface area. Rh catalyst supported on A-1 alumina (Rh/A-1) exhibited higher catalytic activity in the ethylene hydroformylation than other Rh catalysts. It is believed that the high catalytic performance of Rh/A-1 resulted from the well-developed pore structure with high surface area of ordered nanoporous A-1 and consequently finely dispersed Rh particle on the surface of gamma-alumina support.",M1
20352708,"Preparation and characterization of n-hydroxyapatite/PCL-pluronic-PCL nanocomposites for tissue engineering.In this paper, a new kind of polymeric nanocomposite materials based on nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) and PCL-Pluronic-PCL (PCFC) copolymer were prepared by in situ combination method. Firstly, the PCFC copolymer was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone initiated by Pluronic (PEG-PPG-PEG); Secondly, n-HA powder were combined with PCFC to form polymeric composites in the presence of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). The obtained composites were characterized by 1H-NMR, FTIR, XRD, <e>TEM</e>, SEM, DTA/TGA, and tensile testing. The results revealed that n-HA could be dispersed into polymer matrix uniformly, and the n-HA/PCFC composite showed great mechanical properties when the content of n-HA was 10 wt%. The microstructure and thermal properties of the composites were discussed in the paper too. The experimental results suggested that this polymeric nanocomposite might have great potential application in the field of tissue engineering.",M1
20346639,"Crystalline arrangement and nanostructure of aragonitic crossed lamellar layers of the Meretrix lusoria shell.The crystallographic microstructure of Meretrix lusoria shells was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Crystallite sizes were determined by XRD analysis as 72nm, which was quite similar to the 70nm as measured by SEM. The shell comprised aggregates of hexagonal plates of aragonite (500nm wide, 70nm high) and organic matter. These plates were fourth-order units of an aragonitic crossed order lamellar structure. Subsequent TEM images showed the hexagonal plates' nanostructure. The electron diffraction pattern of the fourth-order units revealed a consistent orientation of the hexagonal plates. The fourth-order lamellae (hexagonal crystallites) were piled up in the [001] direction to produce slender prisms (third-order lamellae), arranged mutually parallel, thereby forming a broad tablet (second-order lamellae). The second-order lamellae were piled up in different directions to form the first-order lamellae. The orientation level obtained from XRD and SEM images showed that the crossed lamellar layer was piled up curvilinearly, forming semi-circular growth lines. X-ray diffraction patterns of the cross-sections of the middle layer (vertical and parallel to the growth line) showed that the c axes of aragonite have a disposition of about 20 degrees to the growth direction.",M1
20337377,"Synthesis of gelatin-stabilized gold nanoparticles and assembly of carboxylic single-walled carbon nanotubes/Au composites for cytosensing and drug uptake.Gelatin-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-gelatin) with hydrophilic and biocompatible were prepared with a simple and  green  route by reducing in situ tetrachloroauric acid in gelatin. The nanoparticles showed the excellent colloidal stability. UV-vis spectra, transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), and atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of well-dispersed AuNPs with different sizes. By combination of the biocompatibility of AuNPs and excellent conductivity of carboxylic single-walled carbon nanotubes (c-SWNTs), a novel nanocomposite was designed for the immobilization and cytosensing of HL-60 cells at electrodes. The immobilized cells showed sensitive voltammetric response, good activity, and increased electron-transfer resistance. It can be used as a highly sensitive impedance sensor for HL-60 cells ranging from 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(7) cell mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 5 x 10(3) cell mL(-1). Moreover, the nanocomposite could effectively facilitate the interaction of adriamycin (ADR) with HL-60 cells and remarkably enhance the permeation and drug uptake of anticancer agents in the cancer cells, which could readily lead to the induction of the cell death of leukemia cells.",M1
20237114,"Verhuellia is a segregate lineage in Piperaceae: more evidence from flower, fruit and pollen morphology, anatomy and development.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The perianthless Piperales, i.e. Saururaceae and Piperaceae, have simple reduced flowers strikingly different from the other families of the order (e.g. Aristolochiaceae). Recent molecular phylogenies proved Verhuellia to be the first branch in Piperaceae, making it a promising subject to study the detailed structure and development of the flowers. Based on recently collected material, the first detailed study since 1872 was conducted with respect to morphology, anatomy and development of the inflorescence, pollen ultrastructure and fruit anatomy. METHODS: Original scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and light microscopy (LM) observations on Verhuellia lunaria were compared with those of Piperaceae, Saururaceae and fossils. KEY RESULTS: The inflorescence is an indeterminate spike with sessile flowers, each in the axil of a bract, developing in acropetal, helical succession. Flowers consist of two (occasionally three) stamens with basifixed tetrasporangiate anthers and latrorse dehiscence by a longitudinal slit. The gynoecium lacks a style but has 3-4 stigma branches and a single, basal orthotropous and unitegmic ovule. The fruit is a drupe with large multicellular epidermal protuberances. The pollen is very small, inaperturate and areolate, with hemispherical microechinate exine elements. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the superficial similarities with different genera of Piperaceae and Saururaceae, the segregate position of Verhuellia revealed by molecular phylogenetics is supported by morphological, developmental and anatomical data presented here. Unitegmic ovules and inaperturate pollen, which are synapomorphies for the genus Peperomia, are also present in Verhuellia.",M1
20233455,"Prevalence of a virus similar to human hepatitis B virus in swine.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to established evidence of the existence of a novel member of the hepadnavirus family endemic in swine. Temporarily this virus was designated as swine hepatitis B virus (SHBV). This SHBV can be detected by using human hepatitis B virus diagnostic kits including ELISA, immunohistochemical staining, and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Also seroprevalence of pig farms in Beijing, China, and pathological features of SHBV infection was determined. RESULTS: Screened result shows that overall prevalence of HBsAg was 24.8%, closed to that of anti-HBsAg, whereas HBeAg and anti-HBe were barely detectable. The distribution of HBsAg and HBcAg was examined by immunohistochemistry of liver samples. Typical hepatitis pathological change, such as spotty parenchymal cell degeneration, necrosis of hepatocytes and proliferation of fibrous connective tissue were observed during histopathological analysis. Analysis of HBsAg-positive serum with TEM revealed two morphologic forms, 20 nm and 40 nm sized particles, similar to small spherical and Danes particles of HBV. Observation of the ultrastructure of the liver also found HBV-like particles in the nucleus of hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our research result implies that SHBV could be a causative agent of swine. The discovery of SHBV will unveil novel evolutionary aspects of hepatitis and provides new information for further hepadnavirus research.",M1
20225473,"Effect of collagenase and esterase on resin-dentin interface: a comparative study between a total-etch adhesive and a self-etch adhesive.PURPOSE: To examine the effects of collagenase and esterase activity on the microtensile bond strength and nanoleakage at the resin-dentin interfaces of two adhesive systems: a total-etch adhesive (Single Bond 2: SB) and a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond: SE). METHODS: Resin composites were bonded to the occlusal dentin surfaces of extracted human premolars with either SB or SE. The bonded teeth were sectioned into beams and assigned to one of four storage conditions: phosphate buffer solution (24 hours), phosphate buffer solution (4 weeks), collagenase solution (4 weeks), or esterase solution (4 weeks). Microtensile bond strength was evaluated and analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Failure mode was analyzed under SEM, and nanoleakage was examined with <e>TEM</e>. RESULTS: The bond strength of SE was superior to that of SB after 4-week storage in three aqueous solutions. Collagenase and esterase solutions did not decrease the bond strength of SB any more than the phosphate buffer solution (P &gt; 0.05). In regard to SE, the bond strength after 4-week storage in collagenase solution was lower than in the phosphate buffer solution (P &lt; 0.05). TEM images revealed increasing tendency of nanoleakage in the bonded interfaces after storage in collagenase and esterase solutions.",M1
20218568,"Conformational structural changes of bacteriorhodopsin adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes.The interaction between purple membranes, composed of proteins of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and their native surrounding lipids, and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) has been investigated. In this work, sonication has been used to debundle SWNT in buffer solution without surfactant before the addition of native purple membranes. The sample was then sonicated in a bath for a short time, followed by a centrifugation. The supernatants contain proteins in excess and SWNT as individual and small bundles covered by a bR layer with an average thickness of 1.5 nm. <e>TEM</e> and AFM observations support the idea that only a protein monolayer surrounds the tubes. Optical absorption and infrared spectroscopy measurements provide evidence that the proteins adsorbed onto the SWNT undergo orientational changes of the helical segments in bR and helix conformational changes. We ascribe the main driving force to the hydrophobic interactions between the sidewall of the SWNT and the hydrophobic residues of the alpha-helices of bR.",M1
20214881,"Assessment of penetration of quantum dots through in vitro and in vivo human skin using the human skin equivalent model and the tape stripping method.Quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as an important class of nanoparticles (NPs) with potential applications in medicine. However, little is known about penetration of QDs through human skin. This study investigated skin penetration of QDs in both in vivo and in vitro human skin. Using the tape stripping method, this study demonstrates for the first time that QDs can actually penetrate through the stratum corneum (SC) of human skin. Transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>) and energy diverse X-ray (EDX) analysis showed accumulation of QDs in the SC of a human skin equivalent model (HSEM) after dermal exposure to QDs. These findings suggest possible transdermal absorption of QDs after dermal exposure over a relatively long period of time.",M1
20210456,"Enhanced photoacoustic stability of gold nanorods by silica matrix confinement.Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has garnered much attention for its high contrast and excellent spatial resolution of perfused tissues. Gold nanorods (GNRs) have been employed to further enhance the imaging contrast of PAT. However, the photon fluences typically needed for PA wave induction often also result in GNR shape changes that significantly reduce the efficiency of acoustic wave generation. In this work, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate amorphous silica-coated gold nanorods (GNR-Si) in an effort to improve contrast agent stability and ameliorate efficiency loss during photoacoustic (PA) wave induction. <e>TEM</e> and optical absorption spectra measurements of GNR and GNR-Si show that encasing GNRs within amorphous silica provides substantial protection of nanorod conformation from thermal deformation. PA signals generated by GNR-Si demonstrate considerably greater resistance to degradation of signal intensity with repetitive pulsing than do uncoated GNRs, thereby enabling much longer, high-contrast imaging sessions than previously possible. The prolongation of high-contrast imaging, and biocompatibility and easy surface functionalization for targeting ligands afforded by amorphous silica, suggest GNR-Si to be potentially significant for the clinical translation of PAT.",M1
20207730,"Ring-shaped Rad51 paralog protein complexes bind Holliday junctions and replication forks as visualized by electron microscopy.In mammals, there are five Rad51 paralogs that form two distinct complexes in vivo. One complex is composed of Rad51B-Rad51C-Rad51D-Xrcc2 (BCDX2) and the other Rad51C-Xrcc3 (CX3). We co-expressed and purified human BCDX2 and CX3 protein complexes from insect cells and investigated their binding preferences and structure using transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). We visualized the binding of BCDX2 and CX3 to DNA templates containing replication forks and Holliday junctions, intermediates observed during DNA replication and recombination, respectively. We show that both complexes bind with exceptionally high specificity to the DNA junctions with little binding observed elsewhere on the DNAs. Further analysis of the structure of free or DNA-bound BCDX2 and CX3 complexes revealed a multimeric ring structure whose subunits are arranged into a flat disc around a central channel. This work provides the first EM visualization of BCDX2 and CX3 binding to Holliday junctions and forked DNAs and suggests the complexes form ring-shaped structures.",M1
20206920,"Reversible vesicles based on one and two head supramolecular cyclodextrin amphiphile induced by methanol.Reversible vesicles based on supramolecular inclusion of hydroxypropyl-beta-CD (HPbetaCD) and N,N'-bis(ferrocenylmethylene)-diaminohexane (BFD) were prepared in water and methanol-water mixtures. The inclusion stoichiometry of HPbetaCD with BFD was in a molar ratio of 2:1, which could be named as 'two head' supramolecular amphiphile when the solvent was water. However, the inclusion stoichiometry of HPbetaCD with BFD would tend to be a molar ratio of 1:1 based on introduction of methanol to the solvent, especially when the volume ratio of methanol and water was more than 1:4, which could be named as 'one head' supramolecular amphiphile. The inclusion compounds could switch between 'one head' and 'two head' conformations by changing the methanol concentration of the solvents. The vesicles were also found to be responsive to the stimulus of external molecules. When the inclusion ability between HPbetaCD and an external guest was relatively stronger, the vesicles were easily destroyed. Furthermore, the vesicles disappeared after adding an oxidizing agent. NMR was used to confirm the conformation of the mixture of HPbetaCD and BFD in water. The structure and morphology of the vesicles were characterized by <e>TEM</e> and DLS. The vesicles may be used in smart materials, drug delivery and molecular recognition.",M1

The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), thermal gravimetry analyses (TGA), zeta potential (zeta-potential) titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The BBB penetration and distribution of PEGylated PFMSNs and FMSNs in rat brain were investigated not only at the cellular level with Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), but also at the subcellular level with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results provide direct evidence that PEGylated PFMSNs could penetrate the BBB and spread into the brain parenchyma.",M1
20206128,"Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and ganglioside GM1 spontaneously form small homogeneous vesicles at specific concentrations.The morphology and size of hydrated lipid dispersions of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) mixed with varying mole percentages of the ganglioside GM1 were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of these same mixtures, doped at 0.5 mol% with doxyl labeled lipids, was used to investigate acyl-chain packing. Results show that for 20-30% GM1, hydrated BMP:GM1 mixtures spontaneously form small spherical vesicles with diameters approximately 100 nm and a narrow size distribution profile. For other concentrations of GM1, hydrated dispersions with BMP have non-spherical shapes and heterogeneous size profiles, with average vesicle diameters&gt;400 nm. All samples were prepared at pH 5.5 to mimic the lumen acidity of the late endosome where BMP is an essential component of intraendosomal vesicle budding, lipid sorting and trafficking. These findings indicate that GM1 and BMP under a limited concentration range spontaneously form small vesicles of homogeneous size in an energy independent manner without the need of protein templating. Because BMP is essential for intraendosomal vesicle formation, these results imply that lipid-lipid interactions may play a critical role in the endosomal process of lipid sorting and trafficking.",M1
20205275,"Factors influencing intercellular spaces in the rat esophageal epithelium.AIM: To evaluate the effect of acute stress, hydrochloric acid, ethanol, aspirin, and prednisolone on the intercellular spaces of the esophageal epithelium. METHODS: Part I, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into eight groups and treated with the damaging or control factors. The esophagus of each rat was macroscopically inspected. Histological changes in mucosal biopsies were examined by light microscopy, and the widths of intercellular spaces were determined by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Part II, in part I, we found that acute stress and aspirin induced dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) of the esophageal epithelium. Therefore, the effect of acid suppression pretreatment with esomeprazole on esophageal epithelial DIS induced by water immersion and restraint stress (WRS) and aspirin was further investigated to determine the association of DIS with acid reflux. After administration of 0.9% sodium chloride solution or esomeprazole solution orally for five days, rats underwent WRS or intragastric administration of aspirin solution. Esophageal epithelial intercellular spaces were investigated by TEM. RESULTS: (1) The five damaging factors produced no lesions or inflammation in esophageal mucosa of rats under either gross or routine histological inspections. Esophageal epithelial intercellular space diameters in stress and aspirin groups were significantly greater, nearly three or two-fold respectively, than those in their corresponding control groups (stress model: 0.38 + or - 0.05 microm vs 0.13 + or - 0.02 microm, P &lt; 0.01; aspirin model: 0.32 + or - 0.12 microm vs 0.19 + or - 0.05 microm, P &lt; 0.01). Neither intragastric administration of hydrochloric acid or ethanol, nor hypodermic injection of prednisolone produced DIS compared with their corresponding control groups (hydrochloric acid model: 0.24 + or - 0.03 microm vs 0.19 + or - 0.05 microm, P &gt; 0.05; ethanol model: 0.25 + or - 0.10 microm vs 0.19 + or - 0.05 microm, P &gt; 0.05; prednisolone model: 0.20 + or - 0.03 microm vs 0.14 + or - 0.03 microm, P &gt; 0.05); and (2) No significant difference in the intercellular space diameters was observed between the group pretreated with esomeprazole and the control group, in both the stress and aspirin models (stress model: 0.35 + or - 0.05 microm vs 0.37 + or - 0.05 microm, P &gt; 0.05; aspirin model: 0.24 + or - 0.02 microm vs 0.27 + or - 0.03 microm, P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acute stress and aspirin can induce DIS of the esophageal epithelium in rats, and it is not correlated with acid reflux.",M1
20200711,"Superparamagnetic gamma-Fe2O3@SiO2 nanoparticles: a novel support for the immobilization of [VO(acac)2].This work reports a detailed investigation about the physicochemical properties of superparamagnetic gamma-Fe(2)O(3) nanomaterial synthesized by the co-precipitation method and coated with two silica shells, and its application as support for the immobilization of oxovanadium(IV) acetylacetonate ([VO(acac)(2)]). The influence of the silica coatings on the surface composition and physicochemical interactions of the core-shell nanocomposites is discussed based on the combination of several techniques: electron microscopy techniques (SEM and <e>TEM</e> with EDS), DLS, powder XRD, XPS, FTIR and magnetic characterization. The identity of the iron oxide, gamma-Fe(2)O(3), was confirmed by XPS, FTIR and by the Rietveld refinement of the PXRD pattern. The results obtained by electron microscopy techniques, XRD and magnetization indicated that the gamma-Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles are superparamagnetic and present an average size of approximately 6.5 nm. The first silica coating leads to a core-shell nanomaterial with an average particle size of 21 nm and upon the second coating, the average size increases to 240 nm. Magnetic measurements revealed that the silica-coated nanomaterials maintain the superparamagnetic state at room temperature, although with an expected reduction of the magnetization saturation due to the increase of the silica shell thickness. Furthermore, a numerical fit of the temperature dependence of magnetization was performed to determine the core size distribution and the effect of the silica coatings on the dipolar magnetic interactions. [VO(acac)(2)] was covalently immobilized on the surface of the silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with amine groups, as confirmed by chemical analysis and XPS. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated the catalytic performance of the novel magnetic hybrid nanomaterial in the epoxidation of geraniol, which presented high selectivity towards the 2,3-epoxygeraniol product and easy recovery by magnetic separation.",M1
20200420,"An all-in-one adhesive does not etch beyond hybrid layers.Continuous etching of aggressive all-in-one adhesives occurs in wet dentin tubules after polymerization of the adhesives. This study challenged the hypothesis that unpolymerized acidic monomers from an aggressive all-in-one self-etching adhesive continue to etch beyond dentin hybrid layers. Dentin surfaces bonded with Adper Prompt L-Pop were sectioned into 0.3-mm-thick slabs. Some of the slabs were stored in water (pH 6.8) or glycine buffer (pH 11.1) for six weeks and then examined by CLSM, SEM, and <e>TEM</e>. The rest were immersed in a biomimetic remineralizing medium for up to 4 months. Morphologic analysis indicated no difference in demineralization thickness between the two 6-week storage groups. However, increased permeability and loss of integrity occurred along the base of the hybrid layers in the glycine buffer group, but not in the water storage group. These findings were also confirmed by the results of biomimetic remineralization along the bases of those hybrid layers.",M1
20188107,"Bioconjugation and characterisation of gold colloid-labelled proteins.Colloidal metal particles, in particular gold, have found many biological applications often as probes in light and electron microscopy, and more recently since the 1980s in membrane-based rapid immunoaffinity tests. The surface plasmon resonance absorbance properties in the visible spectroscopy region of gold colloids make them useful tools in medical devices, as the colloids are directly visible to the naked eye. Despite the relative ease with which gold-protein conjugates can be prepared a major issue is the manufacture of poor-quality and poorly characterised bioconjugates that can result in the under performance of subsequent diagnostic tests. This paper describes the preparation of good-quality conjugates for use in immunoassays by optimising the adsorption of antibodies onto the surface of gold colloids, followed by their subsequent characterisation. The conjugates were characterized for size, aggregation and quality using a range of techniques: UV-visible (UV/Vis) absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The biological activities of the conjugated products were also assessed using an immunoassay format and electrochemical measurements. By utilising a number of measurement techniques we aimed to gain a better understanding of the extent of particle aggregation, and the resulting stability and activity of the biological molecule on the surfaces of nanoparticles. The tools developed will enable researchers and companies to ensure the sensitivity, quality and reproducibility of batches of nanoparticle bio-conjugates.",M1
20187872,"Lipopolysaccharide interaction is decisive for the activity of the antimicrobial peptide NK-2 against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.Phosphatidylglycerol is a widely used mimetic to study the effects of AMPs (antimicrobial peptides) on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. However, the antibacterial activities of novel NK-2-derived AMPs could not be sufficiently explained by using this simple model system. Since the LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-containing outer membrane is the first barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, in the present study we investigated interactions of NK-2 and a shortened variant with viable Escherichia coli WBB01 and Proteus mirabilis R45, and with model membranes composed of LPS isolated from these two strains. Differences in net charge and charge distribution of the two LPS have been proposed to be responsible for the differential sensitivity of the respective bacteria to other AMPs. As imaged by <e>TEM</e> (transmission electron microscopy) and AFM (atomic force microscopy), NK-2-mediated killing of these bacteria was corroborated by structural alterations of the outer and inner membranes, the release of E. coli cytoplasma, and the formation of unique fibrous structures inside P. mirabilis, suggesting distinct and novel intracellular targets. NK-2 bound to and intercalated into LPS bilayers, and eventually induced the formation of transient heterogeneous lesions in planar lipid bilayers. However, the discriminative activity of NK-2 against the two bacterial strains was independent of membrane intercalation and lesion formation, which both were indistinguishable for the two LPS. Instead, differences in activity originated from the LPS-binding step, which could be demonstrated by NK-2 attachment to intact bacteria, and to solid-supported LPS bilayers on a surface acoustic wave biosensor.",M1
20187576,"Investigation of liposome formulation effects on rivastigmine transport through human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line (CACO-2).Transportations of rivastigmine containing liposomes across Caco-2 cells were studied and in vitro test results were compared with in vivo results. MTT test was used for cell viability studies. Series of formulations were prepared containing rivastigmine which is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Characterization and stability studies for liposome formulations were performed. Encapsulation efficiencies of liposomes were 35.4%, 25.2% and 29.9% for rivastigmine, rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate, rivastigmine-dimethyl-beta-CD liposomes, respectively. In stability studies, particle size and size distribution, zeta potential, rivastigmine amounts were determined and shelf lives of liposomes were calculated. Penetration properties of rivastigmine through Caco-2 cells, dialysis membrane and kinetics of release from liposomes were determined. Permeability coefficients were calculated after diffusion studies. The highest value of % cumulative amount of rivastigmine passed through caco-2 cell cultures was found to be 87.2% for rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate solution and 12.8% for rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate liposome. The highest permeability coefficient value was obtained with sodium taurocholate liposomes for -0.75. Rivastigmine liposomes and solutions were also applied to animals. Acetyl choline esterase (AChE) activity was determined by the Ellman method on mice. %AChE inhibition values were calculated using blood and brain tissue samples.

Materials S2 and S3 present much higher values of Ti wt% (ca. 3%) than S1 (ca. 1%), indicating the higher functionalization rate induced by the substitution of the chloro ligands by the thiolato ligands in the starting titanocene derivatives. The cytotoxicity of the non-functionalized MCM-41 and S1-S3 toward human cancer cell lines such as adenocarcinoma HeLa, human myelogenous leukemia K562 and human malignant melanoma Fem-x has been studied. In addition the cytotoxicity of these materials on normal immunocompetent cells such as stimulated (PBMC+PHA) and non-stimulated (PBMC-PHA) peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been also studied. M(50) values (quantity of material needed to inhibit normal cell survival by 50%) of the studied surfaces show that non-functionalized MCM-41 was not active against any of the studied cells, while the functionalized surfaces S1-S3 were active against all the tested human cancer cells. The cytotoxic activity of surfaces S2 and S3 were very similar, however, S1 showed lower cytotoxic activity. This phenomenon indicates that the cytotoxicity of the titanocene-functionalized materials strongly depends on the titanium content.",M1
20179848,"Photoactive europium(III) centered mesoporous hybrids with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone functionalized SBA-16 and organic polymers.A series of novel ternary organic-inorganic mesoporous polymeric hybrids TTFA-S16-Eu-PMMA, TTFA-S16-Eu-PMAA, and TTFA-S16-Eu-PVP (TTFA = 2-Thenoyltrifluoroacetone; PMMA = polymethyl methacrylate; PMAA = polymethacrylic acid; PVP = polyvinylpyrrolidone) have been assembled by the Eu(3+) complex covalently attaching to the TTFA directly functionalized ordered mesoporous SBA-16 and organic polymer. FTIR, UV, XRD, <e>TEM</e>, N(2) adsorption measurements, photoluminescent spectra, and TG plots were characterized, and the results reveal that they all have high surface area, uniformity in the mesostructure, and good crystallinity. In addition, the ternary rare earth mesoporous polymeric hybrids show an overall increase in luminescent lifetime and quantum efficiency compared to binary rare earth mesoporous hybrid TTFA-S16-Eu, especially the mesoporous hybrid with PVP exhibits the highest luminescence quantum efficiency and longest lifetime.",M1
20178323,"Outer wall selectively oxidized, water-soluble double-walled carbon nanotubes.The outer walls of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) were selectively oxidized using a combination of oleum and nitric acid. Intercalation of oleum between bundled DWNTs enabled a homogeneous reaction by equally exposing all outer wall surfaces to the oxidants. At optimized reaction conditions, this double-wall chemistry enabled high water solubility through carboxylic acid functional groups introduced to the outer wall, while leaving the inner tube intact, as shown by Raman scattering and high resolution <e>TEM</e>. These outer wall selectively oxidized DWNTs retained electrical conductivity up to 65% better than thin films of similarly functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes, which can be attributed to enhanced electrical percolation via the nonoxidized inner tubes.",M1
20175510,"In vivo behavior of large doses of ultrashort and full-length single-walled carbon nanotubes after oral and intraperitoneal administration to Swiss mice.Carbon nanotube (CNT) materials are of special interest as potential tools for biomedical applications. However, available toxicological data concerning single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) remain contradictory. Here, we compared the effects of SWNTs as a function of dose, length, and surface chemistry in Swiss mice. Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), Raman, near-infrared (NIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies have been used to characterize the tested materials. The dose of SWNT materials used in this study is considerably higher than that proposed for most biomedical applications, but it was deemed necessary to administer such large doses to accurately assess the toxicological impact of the materials. In an acute toxicity test, SWNTs were administered orally at a dose level of 1000 mg/kg bodyweight (b.w.). Neither death nor growth or behavioral troubles were observed. After intraperitoneal administration, SWNTs, irrespective of their length or dose (50-1000 mg/kg b.w.), can coalesce inside the body to form fiberlike structures. When structure lengths exceeded 10 mum, they irremediably induced granuloma formation. Smaller aggregates did not induce granuloma formation, but they persisted inside cells for up to 5 months after administration. Short (&lt;300 nm) well-individualized SWNTs can escape the reticuloendothelial system to be excreted through the kidneys and bile ducts. These findings suggest that if the potential of SWNTs for medical applications is to be realized, they should be engineered into discrete, individual  molecule-like  species.",M1
20175145,"Toxic effects of ethanol on bovine serum albumin.The toxic effects of ethanol on bovine serum albumin (BSA) were measured by resonance light scattering (RLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV), circular dichroism (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). The results indicated that ethanol had toxic effects on BSA, which led to protein denaturation and the effects increased with the ethanol dose. By means of RLS, BSA was found to aggregate in the presence of ethanol and particles smaller than 100 nm were observed from TEM. The fluorescence spectra showed that the intensity of the characteristic peak of BSA decreased and blue shifted, because of changes in the BSA skeleton structure, as well as alteration of the microenvironment of tryptophan (Trp) residues. The conformation changes of BSA were also shown by UV and CD spectrometry.",M1
20174983,"Flow field-flow fractionation: a versatile approach for size characterization of alpha-tocopherol-induced enlargement of gold nanoparticles.Flow field-flow fractionation (FlFFF) was used for size characterization of gold nanoparticles. The measured particle sizes obtained from FlFFF for the commercial 10 nm gold nanoparticle standard and the gold nanoparticles synthesized in the laboratory were in good agreement with those measured by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Further, the capability of alpha-tocopherol to induce enlargement of gold nanoparticles by catalysis of the reduction of AuCl(4)(-) by citrate was observed by monitoring the changes in particle size of gold nanoparticles using FlFFF. The effects of alpha-tocopherol and incubation time on enlargement of the gold nanoparticles were examined. Higher concentrations of alpha-tocopherol resulted in larger nanoparticles. At fixed alpha-tocopherol concentration, larger nanoparticles were formed at longer incubation times.",M1
20173233,"Controlling nanopore size, shape and stability.Solid-state nanopores are considered a promising tool for the study of biological polymers such as DNA and RNA, due largely to their flexibility in size, potential in device integration and robustness. Here, we show that the precise shape of small nanopores (approximately 5 nm diameter in 20 nm SiN membranes) can be controlled by using transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>) beams of different sizes. However, when some of these small nanopores are immersed in an aqueous solution, their resistance is observed to decrease over time. By comparing nanopores of different shapes using (scanning) TEM both before and after immersion in aqueous solution, we demonstrate that the stability of small nanopores is related to their three-dimensional geometry, which depends on the TEM beam size employed during pore fabrication. Optimal stability is obtained using a TEM beam size of approximately the same size as the intended nanopore diameter. In addition, we show that thermal oxidation can serve as a means to independently control nanopore size following TEM fabrication. These observations provide key guidelines for the fabrication of stable solid-state nanopores on the scale of nucleic acids and small proteins.",M1
20170140,"Nanoparticles from lipid-based liquid crystals: emulsifier influence on morphology and cytotoxicity.Here, monoolein-based nanoparticles (NPs), obtained through fragmentation of bulk liquid crystalline phases, and stabilized by two different emulsifiers, namely, Pluronic F127 (PF127) and lauroylcholine chloride (LCh), are investigated for structural features and for short-term in vitro cytotoxicity. Depending on the emulsifiers, different morphologies of the lipid NPs (cubosomes and liposomes) are obtained, as demonstrated by cryo-<e>TEM</e> images. Although NPs offer many advantages in medical applications and various chemicals used for their preparation are under investigation, so far there are no standardized procedures to evaluate cell biocompatibility. Two different protocols to evaluate the impact of these lipid NPs on biological systems are presented. Results show that nanoparticles stabilized by PF127 (cubosomes) display a relevant toxicity toward different cell lines, whereas those stabilized by LCh (liposomes) affect cell viability at a much lesser extent.",M1
20166416,"Microtensile bond strength and interfacial characterization of 11 contemporary adhesives bonded to bur-cut dentin.OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated mechanically and ultra-morphologically 11 different adhesive systems bonded to dentin. METHODS: The microtensile bond strength (microTBS) of 11 contemporary adhesives, including two three-step etch&amp;rinse, three two-step etch&amp;rinse, two two-step self-etch and four one-step self-etch adhesives to dentin, were measured. The resultant interfacial ultra-structure at dentin was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Human third molars had their superficial dentin surface exposed, after which a standardized smear layer was produced using a medium-grit diamond bur. The selected adhesives were applied according to their respective manufacturer's instructions for microTBS measurement after storage in water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours or for TEM interfacial characterization. RESULTS: The microTBS varied from 11.1 to 63.6 MPa; the highest bond strengths were obtained with the three-step etch&amp;rinse adhesives and the lowest with one-step self-etch adhesives. TEM evaluation showed very different interaction patterns, especially for the self-etch adhesives.  Mild  self-etch adhesives demineralized the dentin surface sufficiently to provide micro-mechanical retention, while preserving hydroxyapatite within the hybrid layer to enable additional chemical interaction. CONCLUSIONS: When bonded to dentin, the adhesives with simplified application procedures (in particular, one-step self-etch adhesives) still underperform as compared to conventional three-step adhesives.  Mild  two-step self-etch adhesives that provide additional chemical bonding appear to most optimally combine bonding effectiveness with a simplified application protocol.",M1
20155373,"Identification of the nucleoli of Giardia lamblia with <e>TEM</e> and CFM.Giardia species are flagellated parasites of vertebrates and belong to the diplomonads, most of which have two nuclei. These organisms were classified among the earliest branching eukaryotes on the basis of small subunit rDNA sequences and their lack of many canonical organelles. However, some of these organelles have subsequently been identified in rudimentary form, such as Golgi that become apparent during encystation. One of the  missing  organelles has been the nucleolus, the site of rRNA synthesis, since it was not identified in earlier ultrastructural studies. In the current study, we visualized in-vitro-grown Giardia lamblia trophozoites by transmission electron microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. We found that each of the two nuclei contains a single small and deeply stained granular nucleolus, thus demonstrating that Giardia does indeed have nucleoli.",M1
20154380,"Combination of adenovirus and cross-linked low molecular weight PEI improves efficiency of gene transduction.Recombinant adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene therapy is an exciting novel strategy in cancer treatment. However, poor infection efficiency with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) down-regulated cancer cell lines is one of the major challenges for its practical and extensive application. As an alternative method of viral gene delivery, a non-viral carrier using cationic materials could compensate for the limitation of adenovirus. In our study, adenovectors were complexed with a new synthetic polymer PEI-DEG-bis-NPC (PDN) based on polyethylenimine (PEI), and then the properties of the vehicle were characterized by measurement of size distribution, zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). Enhancement of gene transduction by Ad/PDN complexes was observed in both CAR-overexpressing cell lines (A549) and CAR-lacking cell lines (MDCK, CHO, LLC), as a result of facilitating binding and cell uptake of adenoviral particles by the cationic component. Ad/PDN complexes also promoted the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that a combination of viral and non-viral gene delivery methods may offer a new approach to successful cancer gene therapy.",M1
20154374,"Metal-modified and vertically aligned carbon nanotube sensors array for landfill gas monitoring applications.Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) layers were synthesized on Fe-coated low-cost alumina substrates using radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (RF-PECVD) technology. A miniaturized CNT-based gas sensor array was developed for monitoring landfill gas (LFG) at a temperature of 150 degrees C. The sensor array was composed of 4 sensing elements with unmodified CNT, and CNT loaded with 5 nm nominally thick sputtered nanoclusters of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru) and silver (Ag). Chemical analysis of multicomponent gas mixtures constituted of CO(2), CH(4), H(2), NH(3), CO and NO(2) has been performed by the array sensor responses and pattern recognition based on principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA results demonstrate that the metal-decorated and vertically aligned CNT sensor array is able to discriminate the NO(2) presence in the multicomponent mixture LFG. The NO(2) gas detection in the mixture LFG was proved to be very sensitive, e.g.: the CNT:Ru sensor shows a relative change in the resistance of 1.50% and 0.55% for NO(2) concentrations of 3.3 ppm and 330 ppb dispersed in the LFG, respectively, with a wide NO(2) gas concentration range measured from 0.33 to 3.3 ppm, at the sensor temperature of 150 degrees C. The morphology and structure of the CNT networks have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and Raman spectroscopy. A forest-like nanostructure of vertically aligned CNT bundles in the multi-walled form appeared with a height of about 10 microm and a single-tube diameter varying in the range of 5-35 nm. The intensity ratio of the Raman spectroscopy D-peak and G-peak indicates the presence of disorder and defects in the CNT networks. The size of the metal (Pt, Ru, Ag) nanoclusters decorating the CNT top surface varies in the range of 5-50 nm. Functional characterization based on electrical charge transfer sensing mechanisms in the metal-modified CNT-chemoresistor array demonstrates high sensitivity by providing minimal sub-ppm level detection, e.g., download up to 100 ppb NO(2), at the sensor temperature of 150 degrees C. The gas sensitivity of the CNT sensor array depends on operating temperature, showing a lower optimal temperature of maximum sensitivity for the metal-decorated CNT sensors compared to unmodified CNT sensors. Results indicate that the recovery mechanisms in the CNT chemiresistors can be altered by a rapid heating pulse from room temperature to about 110 degrees C. A comparison of the NO(2) gas sensitivity for the chemiresistors based on disorderly networked CNTs and vertically aligned CNTs is also reported. Cross-sensitivity towards relative humidity of the CNT sensors array is investigated. Finally, the sensing properties of the metal-decorated and vertically aligned CNT sensor arrays are promising to monitor gas events in the LFG for practical applications with low power consumption and moderate sensor temperature.",M1
20153479,"Synthesis and cytotoxicity assessment of superparamagnetic iron-gold core-shell nanoparticles coated with polyglycerol.Core-shell iron-gold (Fe@Au) nanoparticles were synthesized by a facile reverse micelle procedure and the effect of water to surfactant molar ratio (w) on the size, size distribution and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles was studied. MTT assay was utilized to evaluate the cell toxicity of the nanoparticles. To functionalize the particles for MRI imaging and targeted drug delivery, the particles were coated by polyglycerol through capping with thiol followed by polymerization of glycidol. The characteristics of the particles were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). It was found that the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles increase by increasing the water to surfactant molar ratio (w). The particles were spherical in shape with a thin layer of gold. Complementary growth of the gold shell on the iron core was noticed. Meanwhile, two types of agglomeration including magnetic beads and magnetic colloidal nanocrystals clusters were observed dependent on the w-value. The magnetic measurement studies revealed the superparamagnetic behavior of the nanoparticles. MTT assay result indicated the synthesized nanoparticles are nontoxic that will be useful for biomedical applications.",M1
20149613,"Ardipusilloside I purified from Ardisia pusilla competitively binds VEGFR and induces apoptosis in NCI-H460 cells.The present study was to evaluate the effects of Ardipusilloside I isolated from Ardisia pusilla on the growth, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression and apoptosis of NCI-H460 cell line by MTT, ELISA and flow cytometer, respectively. The docking assay between Ardipusilloside I and VEGFR was studied by Sybyl/Sketch module. The change of microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>). DNA fragmentation was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A series of changes were observed in NCI-H460 cell treated by Ardipusilloside I, including microstructure, DNA fragmentation, protein expression of VEGFR, Bax and Bcl-2. The results showed Ardipusilloside I had a good docking with VEGFR and could inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of NCI-H460 cell in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle was significantly stopped at the G(1) phase. Under electronic microscope, the morphology of NCI-H460 cell treated with Ardipusilloside I showed nuclear karyopycnosis, chromatin agglutination and typical apoptotic body. VEGFR and Bcl-2 expression were decreased and Bax expression was increased. In conclusion, all these results demonstrate that Ardipusilloside I has a good docking with VEGFR and has an inhibitory effect on growth of NCI-H460 cell and can induce its apoptosis.",M1
20148529,"Role of solvent protic character on the aggregation behavior of polybenzimidazole in solution.The aggregation behavior of poly(4,4'-diphenylether-5,5'-bibenzimidazole) (OPBI) in polar aprotic (dimethyl acetamide, DMAc) and protic (formic acid, FA) solvents is studied as a function of the polymer concentration and solution temperature. The effects of solvent protic character on the aggregation behavior of OPBI are elucidated. The photophysical studies suggest that the OPBI chains form aggregated structures in both DMAc and FA solutions when the OPBI concentration is increased. The dependences of the emission spectra on the polymer concentrations in two solvents are not similar in nature, indicating that in both of the solvents the aggregations are intermolecular processes, though their mechanisms are different owing to the polyelectrolytic nature of OPBI in FA medium. The triexponential decay profiles obtained from the time-resolved fluorescence study for the concentrated solutions (both in DMAc and FA) display a negative fractional coefficient and longer excited state lifetime, providing support for the aggregations at higher concentration. The temperature dependence emission spectra suggest that the aggregations in both of the solvents destabilize with increasing temperature. The higher activation energy of aggregation (E(A)) in DMAc (5.62 KJ/mol) compared with that in FA (3.07 kJ/mol) reveals that the aggregation formation pathways are different in two solvents and stronger aggregates are formed in the former solvent. The dilute solution viscometry (DSV) studies demonstrate that the OPBI chains adapt a bigger extended conformation in FA compared with DMAc owing to the stronger intramolecular chain repulsion in FA arising due to the polyelectrolyte nature of OPBI in this solvent. A conformation transition of OPBI chains from compact collapsed to extended conformer is observed in DMAc solvent with increasing concentration, whereas any such transition is absent in FA medium. Transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>) images and circular dichroism (CD) spectra are also in agreement with the presence of a conformational transition in DMAc and the absence of it in FA. The temperature dependent DSV studies further support the disruption of aggregated structure with increasing temperature in both of the solvents. DSV studies exhibit that the deaggregation is driven by a conformation transition (extended to compact collapsed) in DMAc, whereas in FA the disruption happens without conformational transition.",M1
20146511,"Micellization activity of the natural lipopeptide [Glu1, Asp5] surfactin-C15 in aqueous solution.Surface tension, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FF-<e>TEM</e>), and circular dichroism (CD) have been used to study the self-aggregation properties of the natural lipopeptide [Glu(1), Asp(5)] surfactin-C15 in 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH 7.4. It has been found that the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of surfactin is 1.54 x 10(-5) M, the surface tension at the cmc (sigma(cmc)) is 27.7 mN/m, and the area per molecule at the air-water interface is 107.8 A(2). Surfactin molecules adopt a beta-sheet conformation already at low concentrations. This feature probably makes it surface-active at such low concentrations. From SANS and FF-TEM results, it is seen that surfactin exhibits a strong self-assembly ability to form sphere-like micelles and some larger aggregates even at the rare low concentration. The aggregation number of sphere-like micelles is much smaller than that for conventional surfactants of similar alkyl chain length.",M1
20136625,"Nanoemulsions as vehicles for topical administration of glycyrrhetic acid: characterization and in vitro and in vivo evaluation.Nano-emulsions are innovative colloidal systems characterized by high kinetic stability, low viscosity, and optical transparency, which make them very attractive in many dermatological applications. Furthermore their small size seems to favor the topical administration of actives which scarcely cross the skin. In the light of these interesting features, the present study was aimed to the evaluation, in vitro and in vivo, of glycyrrhetic acid (GA) release through the skin from the nanoemulsion system. GA-loaded nanoemulsion (GA(N)) was prepared by phase inversion temperature (PIT) method, and was characterized in order to determine mean droplet size and its stability during a well-defined storage period. Further Cryo-<e>TEM</e> studies were performed to obtain information regarding nanoemulsion structure. The GA release pattern from nanoemulsion was evaluated in vitro, to determine its percutaneous absorption through excised human skin (stratum corneum and epidermis, SCE), and in vivo evaluating GA topical anti-inflammatory activity on healthy human volunteers by the UVB-induced erythema model. Nanoemulsions prepared by PIT method showed a mean droplet diameter of 210 nm that drastically changed during a storage of 5 weeks at room temperature. In vitro and in vivo evidence showed that the nanoemulsion system significantly increased the transdermal permeability of GA in comparison to a control O/W emulsion (GA(O/W)) containing the same amount of active compound.",M1
20133870,"Transcriptional patterns in both host and bacterium underlie a daily rhythm of anatomical and metabolic change in a beneficial symbiosis.Mechanisms for controlling symbiont populations are critical for maintaining the associations that exist between a host and its microbial partners. We describe here the transcriptional, metabolic, and ultrastructural characteristics of a diel rhythm that occurs in the symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The rhythm is driven by the host's expulsion from its light-emitting organ of most of the symbiont population each day at dawn. The transcriptomes of both the host epithelium that supports the symbionts and the symbiont population itself were characterized and compared at four times over this daily cycle. The greatest fluctuation in gene expression of both partners occurred as the day began. Most notable was an up-regulation in the host of &gt;50 cytoskeleton-related genes just before dawn and their subsequent down-regulation within 6 h. Examination of the epithelium by <e>TEM</e> revealed a corresponding restructuring, characterized by effacement and blebbing of its apical surface. After the dawn expulsion, the epithelium reestablished its polarity, and the residual symbionts began growing, repopulating the light organ. Analysis of the symbiont transcriptome suggested that the bacteria respond to the effacement by up-regulating genes associated with anaerobic respiration of glycerol; supporting this finding, lipid analysis of the symbionts' membranes indicated a direct incorporation of host-derived fatty acids. After 12 h, the metabolic signature of the symbiont population shifted to one characteristic of chitin fermentation, which continued until the following dawn. Thus, the persistent maintenance of the squid-vibrio symbiosis is tied to a dynamic diel rhythm that involves both partners.",M1
20133110,"Do food microemulsions and dietary mixed micelles interact?Using microemulsions (ME) as delivery vehicles requires understanding whether water-insoluble molecules are delivered by an interaction of the ME system with the dietary mixed micelles (DMM) in the small intestine to give new mixed micelles, or by alternate paths. Diluted DMM and ME systems were mixed at various weight ratios to address this question. The individual and mixed systems were characterized by physical techniques that address this interaction from different aspects. This research showed that increased DMM concentration in ME/DMM mixed systems caused: (1) increased conformational order of the acyl chains and perturbed hydrogen bonds between the ethoxylate headgroups (based on ATR-FTIR results); (2) significant increase in microviscosity (from 1.7 to 3.3ns) (based on EPR results); (3) increased diffusivity of the surfactant molecules compared to their diffusivity in pure ME droplets, and decreased diffusivity of the taurochenodeoxycholate molecules compared to their diffusivities in pure DMM micelles (based on PGSE-NMR results); (4) formation or modification of intramolecular interactions (based on NOESY-NMR results); (5) decreased average droplet diameter and increased droplet density per unit area compared to pure ME systems (based on DLS and cryo-<e>TEM</e> results); and (6) fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two dyes (diphenylhexatriene and Nile Red), which were solubilized in each system separately (based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer results). These results show that DMM and ME interact to create ME-DMM mixed micelles, providing a potential pathway for delivering solubilized molecules.",M1
20133056,"Synthesis and evaluation of chromate and arsenate anions extraction ability of a N-methylglucamine derivative of calix[4]arene immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles.In this study, 5,17-bis-[(N-methylglucamine)methyl]-25,26,27,28-tetrahydroxy-calix[4]arene (3) was synthesized by the treatment of calix[4]arene with a secondary amine N-methylglucamine and formaldehyde. The calixarene derivative (3) was characterized by a combination of FTIR, (1)H NMR and elemental analyses. Followingly, using the macrocyclic building block, the compound 3 was immobilized by [3-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)propyl]trimethoxysilane-modified Fe(3)O(4) magnetite nanoparticles (EPPTMS-MN). The prepared calix[4]arene immobilized material was characterized by a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Moreover, the studies regarding the removal of arsenate and dichromate ions from the aqueous solutions were also carried out by using the compound in solid-liquid extraction experiments. It was found that the calix[4]arene-based magnetic material has high extraction ability towards dichromate and arsenate anions in 66% (at pH 1.5) and in 86% (at pH 3.5), respectively.",M1
20132996,"Staphylococcal strains adapted to epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG) show reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, oxacillin and ampicillin, increased heat tolerance, and altered cell morphology.Epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG) possesses many beneficial properties, such as anticarcinogenicity, antiatherogenicity, as well as antioxidant and antibacterial activities. However, the bacterial response to sublethal concentrations of EGCG has not been studied. Here we investigated whether short exposure of staphylococci strains to sublethal doses of EGCG can lead to adaptation and cross-resistance. Two-hour exposure of five strains to 20 microg/ml of EGCG did not affect the growth rate but significantly elevated the resistance towards antibiotics targeting the bacterial cell wall. The magnitude of cross-resistance towards such antibiotics varied with the staphylococci strain, with Staphylococcus aureus Newman exhibiting the highest magnitude of cross-resistance, showing a 2, 4 and 8-fold increase in resistance towards vancomycin, oxacillin and ampicillin respectively. All EGCG-adapted strains were also more heat tolerant than their control counterparts as derived from the Weibull model. Adaptation to EGCG led to a moderate increase in heat resistance of the adapted strains S. epidermis ATCC 12228, S. aureus Newman, and S. aureus ATCC 29213, and an extremely pronounced increase for S. aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus RN4220. The shape of the survival curve also varied with the staphylococci strain. Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) analysis revealed suppressed separation of daughter cells in cultures exposed to EGCG, as evidenced by the pseudomulticellular appearance and by more than 2-fold increase in cell wall thickness. These observations raise concerns over the potential of EGCG utilization in therapy in that it may contribute to the development and enhancement of microbial resistance mechanisms.",M1
20127802,"Major histocompatability complex class I expression and glial reaction influence spinal motoneuron synaptic plasticity during the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Recent studies have shown that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) expression directly influences the stability of nerve terminals. Also, the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has shown a significant impact on inputs within the spinal cord. Therefore, the present work investigated the synaptic covering of motoneurons during the induction phase of disease and progressive remissions of EAE. EAE was induced in C57BL/6J mice, which were divided into four groups: normal, peak disease, first remission, and second remission. The animals were killed and their lumbar spinal cords processed for in situ hybridization (IH), immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). The results indicated an increase in glial reaction during the peak disease. During this period, the TEM analysis showed a reduction in the synaptic covering of the motoneurons, corresponding to a reduction in synaptophysin immunolabeling and an increase in the MHC I expression. The IH analysis reinforced the immunolabeling results, revealing an increased expression of MHC I mRNA by motoneurons and nonneuronal cells during the peak disease and first remission. The results observed in both remission groups indicated a return of the terminals to make contact with the motoneuron surface. The ratio between excitatory and inhibitory inputs increased, indicating the potential for development of an excitotoxic process. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that MHC I up-regulation during the course of EAE correlates with the periods of synaptic plasticity induced by the infiltration of autoreactive immune cells and that synaptic plasticity decreases after recurrent peaks of inflammation.",M1
20122726,"Self-activated luminescent and mesoporous strontium hydroxyapatite nanorods for drug delivery.Multifunctional strontium hydroxyapatite (SrHAp) nanorods with luminescent and mesoporous properties have been successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. SEM and <e>TEM</e> images indicate that the mesoporous SrHAp samples consist of monodiperse nanorods with lengths of 120-150 nm, diameters of around 20 nm, and the mesopore size of 3-5 nm. The as-obtained SrHAp nanorods show an intense bright blue emission (centered at 432 nm, lifetime 11.6 ns, quantum efficiency: 22%), which might arise from CO(2)(*-) radical impurities in the crystal lattice under long-wavelength UV-light irradiation. Furthermore, the amount of trisodium citrate has an obvious impact on the particle size and the luminescence properties of the products, respectively. The drug storage/release test indicates that the luminescent SrHAp nanorods show a drug loading and controlled release properties for ibuprofen (IBU). Additionally, the emission intensity of SrHAp in the drug carrier system increases with the cumulative released amount of IBU, making the drug release might be easily tracked and monitored by the change of the luminescence intensity. This luminescent material may be potentially applied in the drug delivery and disease therapy fields.",M1
20122723,"The influence of nanoscale grooved substrates on osteoblast behavior and extracellular matrix deposition.To fight bone diseases characterized by poor bone quality like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, as well as in reconstructive surgery, there is a need for a new generation of implantable biomaterials. It is envisioned that implant surfaces can be improved by mimicking the natural extracellular matrix of bone tissue, which is highly a organized nano-composite. In this study we aimed to get a better understanding of osteoblast response to nanometric grooved substrates varying in height, width and spacing. A throughput screening biochip was created using electron beam lithography. Subsequently, uniform large-scale nanogrooved substrates were created using laser interference lithography and reactive ion etching. Results showed that osteoblasts were responsive to nanopatterns down to 75 nm in width and 33nm in depth. SEM and <e>TEM</e> studies showed that an osteoblast-driven calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralization was observed to follow the surface pattern dimensions. Strikingly, aligned mineralization was found on even smaller nanopatterns of 50 nm in width and 17 nm in depth. A single cell based approach for real time PCR demonstrated that osteoblast-specific gene expression was increased on nanopatterns relative to a smooth control. The results indicate that nanogrooves can be a very promising tool to direct the bone response at the interface between an implant and the bone tissue.",M1
20117198,"Folate mediated histidine derivative of quaternised chitosan as a gene delivery vector.Folate targeted gene delivery vectors showed enhanced accumulation in folate receptor expressing tumor model. In the present work, the water solubility and transfection efficiency of chitosans were improved by modifying the depolymerised trimethylated chitosans with histidine moiety. Folate mediated targeting was induced by conjugating poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEG-FA) on histidine modified chitosan polymer having low molecular weight of 15 kDa and high degree of quaternisation (HTFP15-H). The zeta potential and size of the HTFP15-H/pDNA nanoparticles were determined using dynamic light scattering technique and the results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). The morphology of the nanoparticles was found spherical in shape having core-shell nanostructure. The HTFP15-H derivative found to buffer in the pH range from 10 to 4. The blood compatibility in terms of percentage hemolysis, erythrocyte aggregation and also by platelet activation was found to be significantly improved compared to the control vector PEI. At a concentration of 10 microg the derivative promote the cell growth up to 139% compared to control at normal cell growing conditions. The transfection efficiency in KB cell line, which over expresses the folate receptor (FR) in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was also found to be comparable to the control. Moreover the enhanced cellular and nuclear uptake due to the conjugation of both folic acid and histidine makes it a potential vector for gene delivery applications.",M1
20112983,"Aptamer-based silver nanoparticles used for intracellular protein imaging and single nanoparticle spectral analysis.Aptamer-adapted silver nanoparticles (Apt-AgNPs) were developed as a novel optical probe for simultaneous intracellular protein imaging and single nanoparticle spectral analysis, wherein AgNPs act as an illuminophore and the aptamer as a biomolecule specific recognition unit, respectively. It was found that streptavidin-conjugated and aptamer-functionalized AgNPs show satisfactory biocompatibility and stability in cell culture medium, and thus not only can act as a high contrast imaging agent for both dark-field light scattering microscope and <e>TEM</e> imaging but also can inspire supersensitive single nanoparticle spectra for potential intercellular microenvironment analysis. Further investigations showed that caveolae-related endocytosis is likely a necessary pathway for Apt-AgNPs labeled PrP(c) internalization in human bone marrow neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH cells). The integrated capability of Apt-AgNPs to be used as light scattering and TEM imaging agents, along with their potential use for single nanoparticle spectral analysis, makes them a great promise for future biomedical imaging and disease diagnosis.",M1
20112925,"Synthesis of dental enamel-like hydroxyapatite through solution mediated solid-state conversion.An ordered dental enamel-like structure of hydroxyapatite (HAp) was achieved through a solution mediated solid-state conversion process with organic phosphate surfactant and gelatin as the mediating agent. Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) tests demonstrated uniform sizes in the obtained apatite nanorods which arranged in parallel to each other along the c-axis and formed organized microarchitectural units over 10 microm in size. The sizes of the synthetic hydroxyapatite nanorods were similar to that observed in enamel from human teeth. The formation and regulation of the orientation and size of HAp nanorods might lead to a better understanding of the biomineralization process for the preparation of high performance biomaterials.",M1
20107599,"Persistent ER stress induces the spliced leader RNA silencing pathway (SLS), leading to programmed cell death in Trypanosoma brucei.Trypanosomes are parasites that cycle between the insect host (procyclic form) and mammalian host (bloodstream form). These parasites lack conventional transcription regulation, including factors that induce the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, they possess a stress response mechanism, the spliced leader RNA silencing (SLS) pathway. SLS elicits shut-off of spliced leader RNA (SL RNA) transcription by perturbing the binding of the transcription factor tSNAP42 to its cognate promoter, thus eliminating trans-splicing of all mRNAs. Induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in procyclic trypanosomes elicits changes in the transcriptome similar to those induced by conventional UPR found in other eukaryotes. The mechanism of up-regulation under ER stress is dependent on differential stabilization of mRNAs. The transcriptome changes are accompanied by ER dilation and elevation in the ER chaperone, BiP. Prolonged ER stress induces SLS pathway. RNAi silencing of SEC63, a factor that participates in protein translocation across the ER membrane, or SEC61, the translocation channel, also induces SLS. Silencing of these genes or prolonged ER stress led to programmed cell death (PCD), evident by exposure of phosphatidyl serine, DNA laddering, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as typical morphological changes observed by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). ER stress response is also induced in the bloodstream form and if the stress persists it leads to SLS. We propose that prolonged ER stress induces SLS, which serves as a unique death pathway, replacing the conventional caspase-mediated PCD observed in higher eukaryotes.",M1
20104349,"Crystallization of synthetic haemozoin (beta-haematin) nucleated at the surface of lipid particles.The mechanism of formation of haemozoin, a detoxification by-product of several blood-feeding organisms including malaria parasites, has been a subject of debate; however, recent studies suggest that neutral lipids may serve as a catalyst. In this study, a model system consisting of an emulsion of neutral lipid particles was employed to investigate the formation of beta-haematin, the synthetic counterpart of haemozoin, at the lipid-water interface. A solution of monoglyceride, either monostearoylglycerol (MSG) or monopalmitoylglycerol (MPG), dissolved in acetone and methanol was introduced to an aqueous surface. Fluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopic (<e>TEM</e>) imaging and dynamic light scattering analysis of samples obtained from beneath the surface confirmed the presence of homogeneous lipid particles existing in two major populations: one in the low micrometre size range and the other in the hundred nanometre range. The introduction of haem (Fe(iii)PPIX) to this lipid particle system under biomimetic conditions (37 degrees C, pH 4.8) produced beta-haematin with apparent first-order kinetics and an average half life of 0.5 min. TEM of monoglycerides (MSG or MPG) extruded through a 200 nm filter with haem produced beta-haematin crystals aligned and parallel to the lipid-water interface. These TEM data, together with a model system replacing the lipid with an aqueous organic solvent interface using either methyl laurate or docosane demonstrated that the OH and C[double bond, length as m-dash]O groups are apparently necessary for efficient nucleation. This suggests that beta-haematin crystallizes via epitaxial nucleation at the lipid-water interface through interaction of Fe(iii)PPIX with the polar head group. Once nucleated, the crystal grows parallel to the interface until growth is terminated by the curvature of the lipid particle. The hydrophobic nature of the mature crystal favours an interior transport resulting in crystals aligned parallel to the lipid-water interface and each other, strikingly similar to that seen in malaria parasites.",M1
20103053,"Unfolded protein response in fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy: a unifying pathogenic pathway?PURPOSE: To assess for activation of the unfolded protein response in corneal endothelium of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy patients. DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative case series of laboratory specimens. METHODS: Corneal specimens of patients with Fuchs dystrophy and controls with corneal pathologic features other than Fuchs dystrophy were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) to evaluate for structural changes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in corneal endothelium. TEM images were evaluated for alterations of rough endoplasmic reticulum as a sign of unfolded protein response. Normal autopsy eyes, Fuchs dystrophy corneas, and keratoconus corneas were used for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of patient corneas for 3 unfolded protein response markers (GRP78, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, C/EBP homologous protein) and 2 apoptosis markers (caspase 3 and 9). Immunohistochemistry signal quantitation of corneal endothelium for evaluation of marker expression was performed using automated software. Corneal sections were assessed quantitatively for levels of immunohistochemistry marker expression. RESULTS: TEM showed enlargement of rough endoplasmic reticulum in corneal endothelium of all Fuchs dystrophy specimens. Immunohistochemistry quantitation demonstrated a significant increase in mean signal in corneal endothelium from Fuchs dystrophy patients for markers GRP78, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, C/EBP homologous protein, and caspase 9 compared with non-Fuchs dystrophy corneas (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: Results of both TEM and immunohistochemistry indicate activation of unfolded protein response in Fuchs dystrophy. Unfolded protein response activation leads to endothelial cell apoptosis in Fuchs dystrophy and may play a central pathogenic role in this disease.",M1

20097547,"Structural and morphological transition of long-chain phospholipid vesicles induced by mixing with short-chain phospholipid.Effects of a short-chain phospholipid, dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC), on the structure and morphology of membrane assemblies of a long-chain phospholipid, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), were examined by fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-<e>TEM</e>). It was found by fluorescence measurements that DHPC affects on the gel and liquid crystalline state of DMPC vesicle membranes in different ways. Further, the result of DSC suggested that, along the transition process from DMPC vesicle to DMPC-DHPC mixed micelle, there are at least three different concentration regions which are characterized by the individual variation pattern of the transition temperature and enthalpy change. The cryo-TEM micrographs demonstrated the formation of thread-like assemblies in the second region and the coexistence of the assemblies and spherical micelles in the third region. Thus, it was concluded that the structural transition from DMPC vesicle to DMPC-DHPC mixed micelle could occur in a stepwise manner through the formation of the thread-like assembly, which cannot be described by the three-stage model of vesicle to micelle transition.",M1
20095618,"In-situ template synthesis of a polymer/semiconductor nanohybrid using amphiphilic conducting block copolymers.In this study, we synthesized organic/inorganic hybrid materials containing cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles using a novel amphiphilic conducting block copolymer as a synergistic structure-directing template and an efficient exciton quencher of the hybrid. The amphiphilic rod-coil block copolymer of polyphenylene-b-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (PPH-PVP) was first prepared from its coil-coil precursor block copolymer of poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene)-b-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (PCHD-PVP) by using sequential anionic polymerization followed by the aromatization reaction of converting the PCHD block to form conducting PPH. The synthesized PCHD-PVP block copolymers self-assembled into different bulk nanostructures of lamellae, cylinders, and spheres at a volume fraction similar to that of many coil-coil block copolymer systems. However, an enhanced chain-stiffness-induced morphological transformation was observed after the aromatization reaction. This is evidenced by the <e>TEM</e> observation in which both spherical and cylindrical structured PCHD-PVPs transform into lamellar structured PPH-PVPs after aromatization. In addition to the bulk-phase transformation, the rigid-rod characteristic of the conducting PPH block also affects the self-assembling property of the block copolymers in their solution state. CdS nanoparticles were synthesized in situ in a selective solvent of THF using PCHD-PVP and PPH-PVP micelles as nanoreactors. The PPH-PVP/Cd ion in THF exhibits a new ringlike structure of uniform size (approximately 50 nm) with PPH in the inner rim and complexed PVP/Cd ions in the outer rim as a result of the effects of strong intermolecular forces between PPH segments and the solvophobic interaction. CdS nanoclusters were subsequently synthesized in situ from the PPH-PVP/Cd(2+) ring structure, forming a nanohybrid with intimate contact between the PPH domain and CdS nanoparticles. In particular, we found that there is an efficient energy/electron transfer between the conducting PPH domain and CdS nanoparticles in the hybrid, resulting in an enhanced PL quenching effect. The novel nanohybrid shows the potential to be used for optoelectronic applications.",M1
20085569,"A note on langerhans cells in the oesophagus epithelium of domesticated mammals.Using the zinc-iodide osmium tetroxide (ZIO) method, <e>TEM</e> and immunohistochemistry (for CD1a and langerin), the study demonstrates Langerhans cells in the oesophageal epithelium of domesticated mammals (herbivores: horse, cattle, goat; omnivores: pig, dog, laboratory rat; carnivores: cat), although with variations between the species. The ZIO method and TEM showed this cell type in the cat and, sporadically, in the horse; CD1a (+) Langerhans cells were demonstrated in the ovine, porcine and murine oesophagus. Positive staining for langerin was detected in single cells of the caprine, canine, murine and feline oesophagus and more distinct in almost all the cell layers of the equine and porcine oesophagus epithelium. The findings are discussed comparing specifically the results for CD1a and langerin, whereby the latter C-type lectin may be of importance in species with a rather thick oesophagus epithelium, such as that present in the plantivorous and most of the omnivorous animals, where antigenic pressure is reduced.",M1
20085481,"Comparing milled fiber, Quebec ore, and textile factory dust: has another piece of the asbestos puzzle fallen into place?Results of a meta-analysis indicate that the variation in potency factors observed across published epidemiology studies can be substantially reconciled (especially for mesothelioma) by considering the effects of fiber size and mineral type, but that better characterization of historical exposures is needed before improved exposure metrics potentially capable of fully reconciling the disparate potency factors can be evaluated. Therefore, an approach for better characterizing historical exposures, the Modified Elutriator Method (MEM), was evaluated to determine the degree that dusts elutriated using this method adequately mimic dusts generated by processing in a factory. To evaluate this approach, elutriated dusts from Grade 3 milled fiber (the predominant feedstock used at a South Carolina [SC] textile factory) were compared to factory dust collected at the same facility. Elutriated dusts from chrysotile ore were also compared to dusts collected in Quebec mines and mills. Results indicate that despite the substantial variation within each sample set, elutriated dusts from Grade 3 fiber compare favorably to textile dusts and elutriated ore dusts compare to dusts from mines and mills. Given this performance, the MEM was also applied to address the disparity in lung cancer mortality per unit of exposure observed, respectively, among chrysotile miners/millers in Quebec and SC textile workers. Thus, dusts generated by elutriation of stockpiled chrysotile ore (representing mine exposures) and Grade 3 milled fiber (representing textile exposures) were compared. Results indicate that dusts from each sample differ from one another. Despite such variation, however, the dusts are distinct and fibers in Grade 3 dusts are significantly longer than fibers in ore dusts. Moreover, phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) structures in Grade 3 dusts are 100% asbestos and counts of PCM-sized structures are identical, whether viewed by PCM or transmission electron microscope (<e>TEM</e>). In contrast, a third of PCM structures in ore dusts are not asbestos and only a third that are counted by PCM are also counted by TEM. These distinctions also mirror the characteristics of the bulk materials themselves. Perhaps most important, when the differences in size distributions and PCM/TEM distinctions in these dusts are combined, the combined difference is sufficient to completely explain the difference in exposure/response observed between the textile worker and miner/miller cohorts. Importantly, however, evidence that such an explanation is valid can only be derived from a meta-analysis (risk assessment) covering a diverse range of epidemiology study environments, which is beyond the scope of the current study. The above findings suggest that elutriator-generated dusts mimic factory dusts with sufficient reliability to support comparisons between historical exposures experienced by the various cohorts studied by epidemiologists. A simulation was also conducted to evaluate the relative degree that the characteristics of dust are driven by the properties of the bulk material processed versus the nature of the mechanical forces applied. That results indicate it is the properties of bulk materials reinforces the theoretical basis justifying use of the elutriator to reconstruct historical exposures. Thus, the elutriator may be a valuable tool for reconstructing historical exposures suitable for supporting continued refinements of the risk models being developed to predict asbestos-related cancer risk.",M1
20085257,"Effective photocatalytic disinfection of E. coli K-12 using AgBr-Ag-Bi2WO6 nanojunction system irradiated by visible light: the role of diffusing hydroxyl radicals.Urgent development of effective and low-cost disinfecting technologies is needed to address the problems caused by an outbreak of harmful microorganisms. In this work, we report an effective photocatalytic disinfection of E. coli K-12 by using a AgBr-Ag-Bi(2)WO(6) nanojunction system as a catalyst under visible light (lambda &gt;or= 400 nm) irradiation. The visible-light-driven (VLD) AgBr-Ag-Bi(2)WO(6) nanojunction could completely inactivate 5 x 10(7) cfu mL(-1) E. coli K-12 within 15 min, which was superior to other VLD photocatalysts such as Bi(2)WO(6) superstructure, Ag-Bi(2)WO(6) and AgBr-Ag-TiO(2) composite. Moreover, the photochemical mechanism of bactericidal action for the AgBr-Ag-Bi(2)WO(6) nanojunction was investigated by using different scavengers. It was found that the diffusing hydroxyl radicals generated both by the oxidative pathway and the reductive pathway play an important role in the photocatalytic disinfection. Moreover, direct contact between the AgBr-Ag-Bi(2)WO(6) nanojunction and bacterial cells was not necessary for the photocatalytic disinfection of E. coli K-12. Finally, the photocatalytic destruction of the bacterial cells was directly observed by <e>TEM</e> images and further confirmed by the determination of potassium ion (K(+)) leakage from the killed bacteria. This work provides a potential effective VLD photocatalyst to disinfect the bacterial cells, even to destruct the biofilm that can provide shelter and substratum for microorganisms and resist to disinfection.",M1
20083304,"One-year stability of resin-dentin bonds created with a hydrophobic ethanol-wet bonding technique.Dentin bonding performed with hydrophobic resins using ethanol-wet bonding should be less susceptible to degradation but this hypothesis has never been validated. OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study evaluated stability of resin-dentin bonds created with an experimental three-step BisGMA/TEGDMA hydrophobic adhesive or a three-step hydrophilic adhesive after one year of accelerated aging in artificial saliva. METHODS: Flat surfaces in mid-coronal dentin were obtained from 45 sound human molars and randomly divided into three groups (n=15): an experimental three-step BisGMA/TEGDMA hydrophobic adhesive applied to ethanol (ethanol-wet bonding-GI) or water-saturated dentin (water-wet bonding-GII) and Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose [MP-GIII] applied, according to manufacturer instructions, to water-saturated dentin. Resin composite crowns were incrementally formed and light-cured to approximately 5mm in height. Bonded specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 24h and sectioned into sticks. They were subjected to microtensile bond test and <e>TEM</e> analysis immediately and after one year. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: MP exhibited significant reduction in microtensile bond strength after aging (24h: 40.6+/-2.5(a); one year: 27.5+/-3.3(b); in MPa). Hybrid layer degradation was evident in all specimens examined by TEM. The hydrophobic adhesive with ethanol-wet bonding preserved bond strength (24h: 43.7+/-7.4(a); one year: 39.8+/-2.7(a)) and hybrid layer integrity, with the latter demonstrating intact collagen fibrils and wide interfibrillar spaces. SIGNIFICANCE: Coaxing hydrophobic resins into acid-etched dentin using ethanol-wet bonding preserves resin-dentin bond integrity without the adjunctive use of MMPs inhibitors and warrants further biocompatibility and patient safety's studies and clinical testing.",M1
20078424,"Intracellular aggregation of human stefin B: confocal and electron microscopy study.BACKGROUND: Protein aggregation is a major contributor to the pathogenic mechanisms of human neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in the CSTB (cystatin B) gene [StB (stefin B)] cause EPM1 (progressive myoclonus epilepsy of type 1), an epilepsy syndrome with features of neurodegeneration and increased oxidative stress. Oligomerization and aggregation of StB in mammalian cells have recently been reported. It has also been observed that StB is overexpressed after seizures and in certain neurodegenerative conditions, which could potentially lead to its aggregation. Human StB proved to be a good model system to study amyloid fibril formation in vitro and, as we show here, to study protein aggregation in cells. RESULTS: Endogenous human StB formed smaller, occasional cytoplasmic aggregates and chemical inhibition of the UPS (ubiquitin-proteasome system) led to an increase in the amount of the endogenous protein and also increased its aggregation. Further, we characterized both the untagged and T-Sapphire-tagged StB on overexpression in mammalian cells. Compared with wild-type StB, the EPM1 missense mutant (G4R), the aggregate-prone EPM1 mutant (R68X) and the Y31 StB variant (both tagged and untagged) formed larger cytosolic and often perinuclear aggregates accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization. Non-homogeneous morphology of these large aggregates was revealed using <e>TEM</e> (transmission electron microscopy) with StB detected by immunogold labelling. StB-positive cytoplasmic aggregates were partially co-localized with ubiquitin, proteasome subunits S20 and S26 and components of microfilament and microtubular cytoskeleton using confocal microscopy. StB aggregates also co-localized with LC3 and the protein adaptor p62, markers of autophagy. Flow cytometry showed that protein aggregation was associated with reduced cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that endogenous StB aggregates within cells, and that aggregation is increased upon protein overexpression or proteasome inhibition. From confocal and TEM analyses, we conclude that aggregates of StB show some of the molecular characteristics of aggresomes and may be eliminated from the cell by autophagy. Intracellular StB aggregation shows a negative correlation with cell survival.",M1
20075867,"Evidence for a protein tether involved in somatic touch.The gating of ion channels by mechanical force underlies the sense of touch and pain. The mode of gating of mechanosensitive ion channels in vertebrate touch receptors is unknown. Here we show that the presence of a protein link is necessary for the gating of mechanosensitive currents in all low-threshold mechanoreceptors and some nociceptors of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using <e>TEM</e>, we demonstrate that a protein filament with of length approximately 100 nm is synthesized by sensory neurons and may link mechanosensitive ion channels in sensory neurons to the extracellular matrix. Brief treatment of sensory neurons with non-specific and site-specific endopeptidases destroys the protein tether and abolishes mechanosensitive currents in sensory neurons without affecting electrical excitability. Protease-sensitive tethers are also required for touch-receptor function in vivo. Thus, unlike the majority of nociceptors, cutaneous mechanoreceptors require a distinct protein tether to transduce mechanical stimuli.",M1
20070969,"Asymmetric flow field flow fractionation of aqueous C60 nanoparticles with size determination by dynamic light scattering and quantification by liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure photo-ionization mass spectrometry.A size separation method was developed for aqueous C60 fullerene aggregates (aqu/C60) using asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AF4) coupled to a dynamic light scattering detector in flow through mode. Surfactants, which are commonly used in AF4, were avoided as they may alter suspension characteristics. Aqu/C60 aggregates generated by sonication in deionized water ranged in size from 80 to 260 nm in hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) as determined by DLS in flow through mode, which was corroborated by analysis of fractions by DLS in batch mode and by <e>TEM</e>. The mass of C60 in each fraction was determined by LC-APPI-MS. Only 5.2+/-6.7% of the total aqu/C60 mass had Dh less than 80 nm, while 58+/-32% of the total aqu/C60 mass had Dh between 80 and 150 nm and 14+/-9.2% of the total aqu/C60 were between 150 and 260 nm in Dh. With the optimal fractionation parameters, 77+/-5.8% of the aqu/C60 mass eluted from the AF4 channel, indicating deposition on the AF4 membrane had occurred during fractionation; use of alternative membranes did not reduce deposition. Channel flow splitting increased detector response although channel split ratios greater than 80% of the channel flow led to decreased detector response. This is the first report on the use of AF4 for fractionating a colloidal suspension of aqu/C60.",M1

20061815,"New methods allowing the detection of protein aggregates: a case study on trastuzumab.Aggregation compromises the safety and efficacy of therapeutic proteins. According to the manufacturer, the therapeutic immunoglobulin trastuzumab (Herceptin) should be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride before administration. Dilution in 5% dextrose solutions is prohibited. The reason for the interdiction is not mentioned in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documentation, but the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Summary of Product Characteristics states that dilution of trastuzumab in dextrose solutions results in protein aggregation. In this paper, asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (FFF), fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) have been used to characterize trastuzumab samples diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride, a stable infusion solution, as well as in 5% dextrose (a solution prone to aggregation). When trastuzumab samples were injected in the FFF channel using a standard separation method, no difference could be seen between trastuzumab diluted in sodium chloride and trastuzumab diluted in dextrose. However, during FFF measurements made with appropriate protocols, aggregates were detected in 5% dextrose. The parameters enabling the detection of reversible trastuzumab aggregates are described. Aggregates could also be documented by fluorescence microscopy and TEM. Fluorescence spectroscopy data were indicative of conformational changes consistent with increased aggregation and adsorption to surfaces. The analytical methods presented in this study were able to detect and characterize trastuzumab aggregates.",M1

The colloid obtained at a pH of 8.5 is found to consist of monodispersed and nearly spherical silver nanoparticles of size approximately 4 nm which is a significant advancement in biosynthesis. The high crystallinity with fcc phase is evidenced by clear lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM image and peaks in the XRD pattern corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes.

20057054,"A toolkit for the characterization of CCD cameras for transmission electron microscopy.Charge-coupled devices (CCD) are nowadays commonly utilized in transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) for applications in life sciences. Direct access to digitized images has revolutionized the use of electron microscopy, sparking developments such as automated collection of tomographic data, focal series, random conical tilt pairs and ultralarge single-particle data sets. Nevertheless, for ultrahigh-resolution work photographic plates are often still preferred. In the ideal case, the quality of the recorded image of a vitrified biological sample would solely be determined by the counting statistics of the limited electron dose the sample can withstand before beam-induced alterations dominate. Unfortunately, the image is degraded by the non-ideal point-spread function of the detector, as a result of a scintillator coupled by fibre optics to a CCD, and the addition of several inherent noise components. Different detector manufacturers provide different types of figures of merit when advertising the quality of their detector. It is hard for most laboratories to verify whether all of the anticipated specifications are met. In this report, a set of algorithms is presented to characterize on-axis slow-scan large-area CCD-based TEM detectors. These tools have been added to a publicly available image-processing toolbox for MATLAB. Three in-house CCD cameras were carefully characterized, yielding, among others, statistics for hot and bad pixels, the modulation transfer function, the conversion factor, the effective gain and the detective quantum efficiency. These statistics will aid data-collection strategy programs and provide prior information for quantitative imaging. The relative performance of the characterized detectors is discussed and a comparison is made with similar detectors that are used in the field of X-ray crystallography.",M1

This Letter reports on the morphological transformations of the membrane fragments leading to multilamellar vesicle formation. The surfactant membranes were swollen with tetra(11-methoxy-11-oxoundecyl)tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (3) (a cyclosiloxane with covalently attached fatty-acid esters) up to 50 mol % based on the surfactant content. That compound was synthesized by hydrosilylation of 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane with four molecules of methyl undec-10-enoate. Using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-<e>TEM</e>), it has been shown that densely stacked multilamellar vesicles form spontaneously in the sonicated DODAB dispersion containing 50 mol % of the compound 3 after adjusting pH to the value of 9.5. This occurs as a result of the hydrolysis of ester bonds of the compound 3 inside the membrane with formation of tetra(11-carboxyundecyl)tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (4). The carboxylic groups in compound 4 are ionized under experimental conditions. That results in the appearance of the negative charge at the surface which neutralizes the positively charged molecules of DODAB, thus reducing repulsive interactions between the membrane fragments. Additionally, as was shown using Langmuir monolayer measurements, the presence of compound 4 expands the DODAB film and decreases its bending rigidity. That makes the bending process considerably easier and promotes formation of multilamellar vesicles.",M1
20051612,"Fabrication of single-phase titanium carbide layers from MWCNTs using high DC pulse.Single-phase layered titanium carbide (TiC) was successfully synthesized by reacting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) under a high direct current (DC) pulse. Single-phase TiC layer fabrication is confirmed as the transformation of multi-layered graphene from MWCNTs. Therefore its thickness and width is almost identical to those of transformed graphene layers. This is the first report on the formation of single-phase layered nano-TiC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-<e>TEM</e>) were used for the characteristic analysis of single-phase layered TiC structures.",M1
20049986,"Development and ultrastructure of Cystoisospora canis Nemeséri, 1959 (syn, Isospora canis) monozoic cysts in two noncanine cell lines.Cystoisospora canis is a coccidial parasite of the intestinal tract that can cause severe disease in dogs. Clinical signs include watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss. Extraintestinal stages of Cystoisospora spp. have been demonstrated in the mesenteric lymph nodes of paratenic hosts. Information on the biology of extraintestinal stages of canine Cystoisospora species is limited. The current study examined the development of C. canis in 2 noncanine cell lines and the ultrastructure of the monozoic cysts that formed. Monolayers of bovine turbinate cells and African green monkey kidney cells were grown on coverslips and inoculated with excysted C. canis sporozoites. Coverslips were collected on various days and fixed and stained for light microscopy (LM) or transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). A single, centrally located, slightly crescent-shaped sporozoite surrounded by a thick cyst wall within a parasitophorous vacuole was observed with the use of LM and TEM. No division and no multinucleated stages were observed with either LM or TEM. With TEM, typical organelles of sporozoites were observed, such as rhoptries, dense granules, a crystalloid body, polysaccharide granules, and a conoid. The structure and ultrastructure of C. canis monozoic cysts produced in vitro are similar to extraintestinal cysts of other Cystoisospora species in experimentally infected animals and those of Cystoisospora belli observed in immunocompromised humans. This is the first study that fully demonstrates in vitro the development of what structurally resemble extraintestinal cysts of a Cystoisospora spp.",M1
20047726,"Transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>) of equine conceptuses at 14 and 16 days of gestation.The present study gives a detailed ultrastructural description of equine conceptuses at Day 14 (n = 2) and Day 16 (n = 3) after ovulation. Whereas on Day 14 only primitive structures were seen, on Day 16 neurulation and formation of mesodermal somites had taken place. The ectoderm of the embryo itself and the surrounding trophoblast ectodermal cells were characterised by specific cell surface differentiations. At the embryonic ectodermal cell surface (14 and 16 days) remarkable protruded and fused cytoplasmic projections were seen, typically associated with macropinocytotic events involved in macromolecule and fluid uptake. This finding adds an important point to the expansion mode of the hypotone equine conceptus, which is characterised by 'uphill' fluid uptake. Numerous microvilli and coated endocytotic pits at the apical trophoblast membrane emphasised its absorptive character. Endodermal cells were arranged loosely with only apically located cellular junctions leaving large intercellular compartments. At the border of the embryonic disc apoptotic cells were regularly observed indicating high remodelling activities in this area. Conspicuous blister-like structures between ectoderm and mesoderm were seen in the trilaminar part of Day-14 and -16 conceptuses. These were strictly circumscribed despite not being sealed by cellular junctions between germinal layers. It is possible that these blisters are involved in embryo positioning; however, further studies are needed to verify this.",M1
20044909,"Development of repaglinide loaded solid lipid nanocarrier: selection of fabrication method.Repaglinide solid lipid nanoparticles (RG-SLN) were fabricated using stearic acid as lipid. Pluronic F68 (PLF68) and soya lecithin were used as a stabilizer. SLNs were prepared by modified solvent injection and ultrasonication methods. SLNs prepared with modified solvent injection method have larger particle size (360+/-2.5nm) than prepared with ultrasonication method (281+/-5.3nm). The zeta potential of the prepared formulations by these two methods varied from - 23.10 +/-1.23 to -26.01 +/-0.89 mV. The maximum entrapment efficiency (62.14 +/-1.29%) was obtained in modified solvent injection method. The total drug content was nearly same (98%) in both the methods. In vitro release studies were performed in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) using dialysis bag diffusion technique. The cumulative drug release was 30% and 50% within 2 hrs in modified solvent injection and ultrasonication method, respectively. This indicates that RG-SLN prepared from modified injection method released the drug more slowly than SLNs prepared with ultrasonication method. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that repaglinide (RG) entrapped in the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) exist in an amorphous or molecular state. Repaglinide loaded solid lipid nanoparticles prepared with both methods were of spherical shape as observed by transmission electron microscopy (<e>TEM</e>). These results suggest that modified solvent injection method is more suitable for preparation of repaglinide SLNs using stearic acid.",M1
20043934,"Zinc protects human peripheral blood lymphocytes from Cr(III)(phenanthroline)3-induced apoptosis.We have studied the effect of Cr(III)(phen)3 [(tris(1,10-phenanthroline) chromium(III) chloride)] on lymphocytes in order to find out if metallothioneins (MTs) are produced in the process. We also investigated whether zinc pretreatment is able to protect cells from apoptosis reported to occur for this compound. Our results indicate that MT synthesis is induced by Cr(III)(phen)3, and it has been identified as the MT-3 isoform through RT-PCR which has not been reported earlier. By zinc pretreatment, this apoptosis is reversed as inferred from cytotoxicity studies, Annexin-V/PI staining, ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining and DNA fragmentation pattern and ultrastructural investigations using <e>TEM</e> and SEM. The zinc pretreatment reduces the amount of ROS produced by Cr(III)(phen)3. The MT-1a and 1b synthesized by zinc (also evidenced through RT-PCR experiments) is possibly able to scavenge ROS which is one of the early signaling molecules that lead to apoptosis. Zinc pretreatment also reverses the changes in downstream signaling events such as mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP levels and the activation of caspase-3. This is the first report on the induction of MT-3 in lymphocytes due to a metal stress or any other stimuli. Even though MT-3 is synthesized here, apoptosis still occurs due to ROS production on Cr(III)(phen)3 exposure when the cells have not been primed with zinc.",M1
9003540,"Anti-recombinogenic and convertible co-mutagenic effects of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) and other 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleoside analogs in S. cerevisiae MP1.In experiments using yeast, without addition of an external metabolic activation system, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) was co-mutagenic and showed an insignificant anti-recombinogenic effect in combination with triethylene melamine (<e>TEM</e>). In the presence of activating S9-mix, the anti-recombinogenicity and co-mutagenicity could clearly be seen. At higher concentrations the co-mutagenic effect was converted into anti-mutagenicity. The other three 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleoside analogs were tested only in the presence of activating S9-mix and showed similar effects. As TEM is a direct alkylating agent that is inactivated by liver microsomes, the higher activity in presence of S9-mix can be interpreted as resulting from metabolic activation of the 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleoside analogs. In previous experiments using yeast bacteria, Drosophila or mice, tumor promoters were co-recombinogenic/anti-mutagenic, and co-carcinogens were co-mutagenic/anti-recombinogenic. Thus, there is not only an operational difference between tumor promoters and co-carcinogens but a real difference in respect to their genetic effectiveness. As up to now only co-carcinogens have shown co-mutagenic and anti-recombinogenic effects, it is perhaps possible that, within a certain concentration range, 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleoside analogs may have co-carcinogenic activity in carcinogenicity tests. At higher concentrations the co-carcinogenic effect may be converted into an anti-carcinogenic one.",M2
7739603,"Comparison of the mutagenicity and mutagen specificity of ethylenimine with triethylenemelamine in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa.Studies have been performed to compare the mutagenicity and mutagenic specificity of the trifunctional alkylating agent, triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>), and a closely related monofunctional agent, ethylenimine (EI), in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a 2-component heterokaryon (H-12) of Neurospora crassa. The primary objective of our studies was to characterize the genetic damage produced by each agent with regard to (1) mutagenic potency, and (2) the spectrum of specific-locus mutations induced in a lower eukaryotic organism. As in higher eukaryotes, specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of H-12 result from gene/point mutations, multilocus deletion mutations, and multiple-locus mutations. Specific-locus mutations resulting from gene/point mutation and multilocus deletion mutation can be detected in higher eukaryotes, but multiple-locus mutations can be detected only with difficulty or not at all. Our experiments with the ad-3 forward-mutation assay have demonstrated that TEM is a strong mutagen (maximum forward-mutation frequency between 100 and 1000 ad-3 mutations per 10(6) survivors) and EI is a moderate mutagen (maximum forward-mutation frequency between 10 and 100 ad-3 mutations per 10(6) survivors) for the induction of specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region. Classical genetic tests were used to identify the different genotypic classes and subclasses among the EI- and TEM-induced ad-3 mutations from each experiment. The overall data base demonstrates that both EI- and TEM-induced ad-3 mutations result predominantly from gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci (97.3% and 95.5%, respectively), and infrequently from multilocus deletion mutations (2.7% and 4.5%, respectively). Heterokaryon tests for allelic complementation on TEM- and EI-induced ad-3B mutations, however, have revealed a difference between the percentages showing allelic complementation (63.1% and 40.9%, respectively). Based on the specific revertibility of complementing and noncomplementing ad-3B mutations induced by other agents, this difference in the percentages of ad-3B mutations showing allelic complementation results from a difference between the spectrum of genetic alterations at the molecular level. In addition, comparison of the ratio of TEM-induced ad-3A and ad-3B mutations with those induced by EI has revealed a difference between the ad-3B/ad-3A ratios. Additional comparisons are made of the mutagenic effects of TEM and EI with those of other chemical mutagens and carcinogens in the ad-3 specific-locus assay in Neurospora.",M2
7870102,"Triethylenemelamine: induction of specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon 12 of Neurospora crassa.The mutagenicity of the trifunctional alkylating (or cross-linking) agent <e>TEM</e> (triethylenemelamine or 2,4,6-tris(1-aziridinyl)-1,3,5-triazine) in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region was studied with a two-component heterokaryon (H-12) of Neurospora crassa. The objective was to characterize the genetic damage produced by this chemical to determine the spectrum of specific-locus mutations induced in a lower eukaryotic organism and to compare this spectrum with that induced in the mouse. Specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of strain H-12 result from gene/point mutations, multiple-locus mutations, and multilocus deletion mutations at the closely linked ad-3A and ad-3B loci. These loci control two sequential biochemical reactions in the purine biosynthetic pathway. A 0.1 M solution of TEM was used to treat conidial suspensions of H-12 for 20, 40, 80, 120, or 170 min to obtain dose-response curves for (1) inactivation of conidia, and (2) the induction of specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region. These experiments demonstrated that TEM is a strong mutagen (maximum forward-mutation frequency between 100 and 1000 ad-3 mutations per 10(6) survivors) for the induction of specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region. Both biochemical and classical genetic tests were used to characterize the TEM-induced ad-3 mutations from each of the five treatment groups to distinguish between the different genotypic classes and subclasses. The overall data base from these genetic studies demonstrates that TEM-induced ad-3 mutations result predominantly (95.5% [769/805]) from gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci, and from a low percentage (4.5% [36/805) of multilocus deletion mutations. In addition, TEM induces an unusually high frequency of multiple-locus mutations with sites of recessive lethal damage closely linked with the ad-3 region. Comparison of the dose-response curves for the major classes and subclasses of TEM-induced ad-3 mutations demonstrates (1) that gene/point mutations and multilocus deletion mutations increase as the 1.4 power of TEM treatment time, and (2) that the two classes of TEM-induced multiple-locus ad-3 mutations consisting of gene/point mutations with separate sites of recessive lethal damage increase at about the 1.96 power of TEM treatment time. When the data from the present specific-locus studies are compared with those in the mouse, we find, insofar as such comparisons are possible, that a similar spectrum of specific-locus mutations has been induced by TEM in each assay system.",M2
7529883,"Chromosome analysis of human spermatozoa exposed to antineoplastic agents in vitro.We studied in vitro the cytogenetic effects of six antineoplastic agents, bleomycin (BM), cyclophosphamide (CP), daunomycin (DM), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), mitomycin C (MMC) and triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) on spermatozoa, using an interspecific in vitro fertilization system between zona-free hamster oocytes and human or bull spermatozoa. In preliminary experiments with bull spermatozoa, clastogenic effects were clearly shown with BM, DM, MMS and TEM, but not with CP and MMC. In main experiments, the effects of the first four chemicals were studied in detail with human spermatozoa. Total numbers of 585 and 512 spermatozoa were karyotyped in the control and the chemical-treated groups respectively. The incidence of spermatozoa with structural chromosome aberrations was 34.5%, 53.0%, 59.3%, and 55.6% in the BM (50 micrograms/ml, 90 min), DM (0.1 microgram/ml, 90 min), MMS (100 micrograms/ml, 120 min) and TEM (0.1 micrograms/ml, 120 min) groups respectively, each showing a significantly higher incidence than the matched controls (10.1-13.5%). Breakage-type aberrations were more frequent than exchange-type aberrations in the BM, MMS and TEM groups, while the exchange-type aberrations were more frequent in the DM group. Exchanges were mainly of the chromatid type in the DM, MMS and TEM groups, while chromosome-type exchanges occurred more frequently in the BM group. These results are discussed in relation to previous data on chemical-induced chromosome aberrations in mammalian somatic cells and in mouse spermatozoa.",M2
8525468,"Measurement of DNA integrity and structure in Xenopus embryos in the presence of hydroxyurea, actinomycin-D, and triethylenemelamine using the fluorescent probe Hoechst 33258.Cell health assay of water quality (CHAWQ) is an assay using intracellular biomarkers measured by optical techniques. CHAWQ uses embryos of the South African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, and optical transducers of intracellular biomarkers to obtain rapid assessment of toxicity to frog embryos. Since the biomarkers are common to all cells, CHAWQ can indicate toxicity of different classes of chemicals. Among the biomarkers used are 1) the change in synthesis rate, 2) the structure, or 3) the environment of DNA. Measurement of DNA to detect genotoxicants has previously used extracted DNA or flow cytometry to detect alterations in DNA content or configuration. We report the use of viable frog embryos and the fluorescent probe Hoechst 33258 to detect the effect of three DNA-active chemicals--actinomycin-D, hydroxyurea, and triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>)--on DNA in intact embryos. We found that we can detect changes in the DNA in the presence of toxicants at concentrations comparable to longer-term assays but following a much shorter time of drug exposure. Actinomycin-D caused a fluorescence decrease, TEM caused a fluorescence increase, whereas hydroxyurea gave a biphasic response. Hydroxyurea caused a decrease at low concentrations and an increase at higher concentrations. Concentration-response data for TEM, hydroxyurea, and actinomycin-D generated EC50 values of 0.1 mg/ml, 1.4 mg/ml, and 6.34 micrograms/ml, respectively.",M2
7509029,"Sister-chromatid exchanges in Picea abies--a test for genotoxicity in forest trees.A genotoxicity test, based on the evaluation of sister-chromatid exchange frequencies, has been developed for the spruce fir. The basic frequency was 36.9 SCEs/cell. Mitomycin C treatment (MMC, 5 x 10(-6) M, 0.5 h) doubled the 'spontaneous' SCE frequency, maleic hydrazide treatment (MH, 5 x 10(-4) M, 0.5 h) increased it nearly 7-fold. This corresponds to data obtained previously for Vicia faba. Chromatid-type aberrations were induced by the same mutagens (MH, 5 x 10(-4) M, 0.5 h; MMC 2 x 10(-5) M, 1 h) or by triethylenemelamine (TEN, 2 x 10(-4) M, 0.5 h). MH treatment resulted in aberration yields comparable to those observed in Vicia faba, MMC and <e>TEM</e> were less efficient aberration inducers in P. abies. While SCEs may be counted for single chromosomes, for reliable evaluation of chromatid aberrations large numbers of complete and well spread metaphases have to be inspected.",M2
7686626,"Combined application of MH and <e>TEM</e> for conditioning treatment simultaneously triggers two protective functions against induction of chromatid aberrations in Vicia faba root tip meristem cells.Conditioning pre-exposure of Vicia faba root tip meristem cells to triethylenemelamine (TEM) does not trigger an adaptive response to maleic hydrazide (MH) and vice versa. Since TEM conditioning treatment can induce protective effects (as evident from the yield of metaphases with chromatid aberrations) against TEM challenging treatment and MH conditioning can trigger an adaptive response to MH challenging treatment, two different protective functions are apparently triggered in dependence on the agent used for conditioning pre-exposure. When a mixture of TEM and MH is being used for conditioning treatment, adaptive responses to both TEM and MH can simultaneously be induced and significantly reduce the yield of metaphases with chromatid aberrations observed after challenge treatment with TEM or MH.",M2
7686625,"Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide does not prevent adaptive responses triggered by heavy metal salts in Vicia faba.Copper sulfate, lead nitrate, and cadmium nitrate conditioning treatments of Vicia faba root tip meristem cells result in adaptive responses to triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>)- and maleic hydrazide (MH)-induced genotoxic effects, i.e., they significantly reduce the yield of metaphases with chromatid aberrations. Contrary to adaptive responses triggered by low clastogen concentrations or heat shock, protective effects induced by heavy metals cannot be prevented by inhibition of protein synthesis and last for a much longer time span (up to at least 48 h). These and other data support the conclusion that the cells can react to the impact of external factors by various inducible functions which eventually protect their DNA from damage.",M2
1363495,"Transplacental genotoxicity of triethylenemelamine, benzene, and vinblastine in mice.Transplacental cytogenetic effects of triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>), benzene, and vinblastine on maternal mice and their fetuses have been investigated using micronucleus and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) as genetic endpoints. CD-1 mice were treated on day 14 and 15 of gestation with TEM (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg), benzene (439,878, and 1,318 mg/kg), and vinblastine (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection at 24 hr intervals, and sacrificed 40 hr after the first injection. Erythrocytic precursor cells in maternal bone marrow and fetal livers (2-4) from each pregnant mouse were used for the micronucleus and/or the SCE analyses. Significant dose-related increases in both micronuclei and SCE were found in maternal bone marrow and fetal liver following TEM treatment. Benzene at the highest dose (1,318 mg/kg) also caused a significant increase in micronuclei and SCE in both maternal bone marrow and fetal liver cells. The embryonic genotoxic effect of TEM was much higher than that of benzene for both genetic endpoints, and the frequency of micronuclei induced by benzene was higher in fetal liver than in maternal bone marrow cells. Vinblastine, a spindle poison, induced micronuclei but not SCE. Micronuclei induction by vinblastine was 7 fold greater in maternal bone marrow than in fetal liver cells. All three chemicals were cytotoxic in maternal bone marrow cells, but not in fetal liver cells except for TEM, which showed a weak cytotoxicity in fetal liver cells in the micronucleus assay. These results indicate that TEM, benzene, and vinblastine are transplacental genotoxicants in mice.",M2
2366786,"Comparison of single/multiple-dose protocols using triethylenemelamine and procarbazine hydrochloride for the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test.Treatment of mice with a single dose of either 4.8 mg/kg of triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) or 348 mg/kg of procarbazine hydrochloride (PC) induced higher frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPE) after 48 h than after 24 h. The same observation was made when animals were treated with 1.6 or 8 mg/kg of TEM or 116 or 580 mg/kg of PC for 2 consecutive days (double-dose protocol). Surprisingly, the third dose of either 1.6 or 8 mg/kg of TEM caused lower MPE frequencies at the 72-h than at the 48-h sampling time. The observation that lower MPE frequencies after 72 h were also accompanied by reduced bone marrow toxicity might have reflected a drug-related adaptive reaction of the animals, for example the induction of detoxifying enzymes. Mean MPE frequencies as well as bone marrow toxicity were also slightly decreased after the third dose of either 116 or 580 mg/kg of PC, but statistical analysis showed no differences between the 48-h and the 72-h sampling times as regards the MPE frequencies and bone marrow toxicity. In addition to the high mean MPE frequency observed after 2 doses of 116 mg/kg of PC at the 48-h sampling time, a late increase in micronucleus induction was also seen after triple dosing at the 96-h sampling time. The present experiments with TEM and PC showed similar sensitivity for the multiple-dose assays when compared with the single-dose micronucleus test. In the case of the triple-dose assay, bone marrow toxicity proved to be a critical factor for appropriate dose selection. The computerized image analysis system was a convenient and time-saving tool for the automatic scoring of large quantities of cells for micronuclei as well as for the evaluation of bone marrow depression from the entire cell population analyzed for micronuclei.",M2

Protection was prevented by pretreatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSI), an inhibitor of the synthesis of plant phytochelatins (PCs), indicating that the NiCl2-triggered PC synthesis may be involved in the protective functions induced by NiCl2 conditioning treatment. BSI (instead of NiCl2) conditioning treatment triggered protection against MH but not against TEM.",M2
2157148,"Genotoxic potency in mouse spermatogonial stem cells of triethylenemelamine, mitomycin C, ethylnitrosourea, procarbazine, and propyl methanesulfonate as measured by F1 congenital defects.Male ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with <e>TEM</e>, MMC, ENU, PCZ, or PMS and mated to untreated females of the same strain on days 64-80 after the treatment. Copulations during this period involve sperm that were spermatogonial stem cells at the time of the treatment. The fetuses were examined on day 18 of pregnancy for external and skeletal abnormalities. The 5 mutagens tested all caused significant increases in the incidence of abnormal fetuses over the control level. The genotoxically effective dose, in mmole/kg, for producing fetal abnormalities with a frequency of 2% was estimated to be 0.007 for TEM and MMC, 0.6 for ENU, 1.8 for PCZ, and 3.0 for PMS. These values correlate well with the mutagenic potency estimated from the data reported for inducing specific-locus mutations in spermatogonial stem cells. Irrespective of the kind of mutagen used, external abnormalities represented by cleft palate and dwarfism occurred more frequently than skeletal abnormalities represented by rib malformations. It is concluded from these data that F1 fetal abnormalities can serve as sensitive indicators for quantitatively assessing the genotoxicity of a chemical agent in spermatogonial stem cells.",M2

2767059,"Long-term effects of triethylenemelamine exposure on mouse testis cells and sperm chromatin structure assayed by flow cytometry.The toxic and potentially mutagenic actions of triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) on mouse body and testis weights, testicular cell kinetics, sperm production, sperm head morphology, and sperm chromatin structure were assessed in two experiments. The first experiment examined effects of four dose levels of TEM, assayed 1, 4, and 10 wk after toxic exposure. In the second study, effects from five dosage levels were measured at 1, 4, and 10 wk, and the highest dosage level was evaluated over 44 wk. TEM produced an expected dose related loss of spermatogenic activity and subsequent recovery as determined by dual-parameter (DNA, RNA) flow cytometry (FCM) measurements of testicular cells. Both testicular weights and caudal sperm reserves remained generally below controls after 44 wk recovery following exposure to the highest (1.0 mg/kg daily x 5) dosage. Chromatin structure alterations, defined as increased susceptibility to DNA denaturation in situ, and sperm head morphology were highly correlated (.87-.93, P less than .001) with dose and with each other. Data obtained from the sperm chromatin structure essay (SCSA) on fresh sperm was highly correlated with measurements of aliquots of the same sample collected over 44 wk, frozen, and then measured on the same day. Sperm head morphology and sperm chromatin structure remained abnormal at 44 wk for the 1.0 mg/kg TEM dosage, suggesting that the abnormalities, present long after the initial toxic response, may be a result of mutation. This study demonstrates that flow cytometry provides a unique, rapid, and efficient means to measure effects of reproductive toxins and potential mutagens.",M2
2753023,"Initiating carcinogen, triethylenemelamine, induces micronuclei in skin target cells.Keratinocytes from mouse skin were cultured for a short period in vitro following single or multiple treatments at low dose levels in vivo with the known chromosome-damaging agent triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>). The chemical was applied to the skin of HRA/Skh hairless mice at concentrations corresponding to those reported to initiate cancer in initiation-promotion assays. A significant dose-related depression in keratinocyte cell recovery occurred over the dose range 0.3-1 mg TEM/mouse (single or multiple treatments). Under the same conditions, a dose-related induction of micronuclei was observed using the cytokinesis-block method with cytochalasin B. A similar frequency of micronuclei was detected in binucleate cells from mice treated with single or multiple applications of TEM. Mice held for 12-48 h post-treatment, before removal of skin for in vitro culture, yielded highest micronuclei frequencies. These results indicate that the same target cell population, skin keratinocytes, can be used to investigate both genotoxicity and carcinogenesis, and that micronucleus induction in these cells may be a sensitive signal of skin cancer initiation.",M2
3193976,"Heat shock protection against induction of chromatid aberrations is dependent on the time span between heat shock and clastogen treatment of Vicia faba root tip meristem cells.Variation of the time span between heat shock (hs) and clastogen treatment of V. faba root tip meristems showed that hs protection is a very quick response (effective after less than 10 min) and lasting for up to 240 min in the case of induction of chromatid aberrations by maleic hydrazide (MH). Analogous protective responses are significantly slower and shorter when <e>TEM</e> is used for aberration induction. This, together with absence of 'clastogenic cross-adaptation' to these agents and differential effects of benzamide (BA, an inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribosylation) pretreatment before hs on hs protection, suggests that hs before clastogen treatment triggers at least 2 clastogen-specific, protective functions which eventually result in protection against these 2 clastogens.",M2
3412373,"Sister-chromatid exchanges induced by triethylenemelamine: in vivo and in vivo/in vitro studies in mouse and Chinese hamster bone marrow and spleen cells.This study was designed to obtain sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies in bone marrow and spleen cells of mice and Chinese hamsters under in vivo and in vivo/in vitro systems following treatment of animals with varying doses (15-405 micrograms/kg) of triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>). A dose-related SCE response was found in both species, tissues, and systems analyzed following TEM treatment. In vivo, similar responses were noted for both tissues in both species. However, in vivo/in vitro, the response was lower than in vivo and it varied with the tissue. The spleen cells were more sensitive and gave higher numbers of SCEs than bone marrow of both species at the two highest doses tested (135 and 405 micrograms/kg).

Novobiocin treatment before heat shock did not prevent heat shock protection against both clastogens; novobiocin application after heat shock prevented protective effects.

No such protection occurred when the alkylating agent triethylenemelamine (TEM) was used for challenge treatment. The differential response of pretreated cells to MH on the one hand (protection) and to TEM (no protection) on the other supports the conclusion that clastogenic adaptation is due to different inducible (repair?) functions, which eventually exert protection against clastogenic impacts.",M2

3362157,"Mutagen-induced fetal anomalies and death following treatment of females within hours after mating.In an earlier study (Generoso et al., 1987), it was observed that the mutagen, ethylene oxide (EtO), produced remarkable increases in the incidence of developmental abnormalities and death of fetuses when early zygotic stages were exposed. This is a major finding in experimental induction of embryopathy, implicating genetic damage to the zygotes as the likely cause. In the subsequent study reported here, 3 other mutagens--ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), and triethylene melamine (<e>TEM</e>), were studied for embryopathic effects following exposure of dictyate oocytes, prefertilization oviducal eggs and sperm, early pronuclear zygotes, zygotes undergoing pronuclear DNA synthesis, and two-cell embryos. All 4 mutagens produced developmental abnormalities among living fetuses following exposure of early pronuclear zygotes (the only stage studied for this endpoint in this report). With respect to stage specificity and gestational timing of death of conceptuses, EMS and EtO on one hand and ENU and TEM on the other, are very similar to one another. EMS, like EtO, produced a high incidence of midgestation and late fetal deaths only in prefertilization oviducal eggs and sperm and in early pronuclear eggs. In contrast, ENU and TEM produced high losses of conceptuses in all postmating stages studied but death occurred primarily prior to or around the time of implantation. Thus, the frequency of induction and the expression of embryopathy, which ranged from early embryonic preimplantation and late fetal deaths to subtle fetal anomalies, are dependent upon the stage exposed and the mutagen used.",M2
3345738,"Detection of <e>TEM</e>-induced reciprocal translocations in F1 sons of CD-1 male mice: comparison of sequential fertility evaluation and cytogenetic analysis.To determine the positive and negative classification error rates associated with the HTA in our laboratory, F1 sons of TEM-exposed CD-1 male mice were evaluated by the sequential fertility method with subsequent cytogenetic analysis. Males who sired three litters of size 10 or less when mated to primiparous females from either the B6C3F1 or the BCF1 strain were classified as partial steriles. When meiotic chromosome analyses revealed the presence of at least two cells containing multivalent figures, males were classified as translocation heterozygotes. When the fertility evaluation and the cytogenetic analysis were compared, normal fertility was observed on 5 of 83 (6.02%) translocation-bearing F1 males mated to B6C3F1 tester females and on 3 of 83 (3.61%) F1 males mated to BCF1 tester females. Thus, the false-negative error rates were 6.02% and 3.61% with these two tester strains. Multivalent figures were not observed in the meiotic chromosomes of 410 F1 males. Of these, 12 (2.93%) had reduced fertility when mated to the B6C3F1 tester strain as did 7 (1.71%) mated to the BCF1 strain. Thus, the false-positive error rates with these two tester strains were 2.93% for the B6C3F1 strain and 1.71% for the BCF1 strain. Our results indicate that non-zero error rates, both false-positive and false-negative, are associated with the sequential mating method HTA. In addition, the magnitude of these error rates was influenced not only by the tester female strain but also by the genotype of the F1 male.",M2

This may be indicative that inducible processes connected with ribosylation reactions are involved in the protective effects exerted by clastogenic adaptation. No increase by benzamide pretreatment was observed in the yield of metaphases with TEM- or MH-induced chromatid aberrations after conditioning and challenge treatment, respectively. High benzamide concentrations (1 h, 5 X 10(-3) M) exerted protective effects against TEM challenging but not against MH.",M2

The chemicals were administered to male mice (C3Hf X 101)F1 by IP injection or gavage using acute or 5-day subacute regimens. After completion of dosing, methyl-[3H]thymidine [( 3H]TdR) was injected into the testes, and spermatozoa were collected 16 days later. The sperm heads were isolated, and UDS was determined by the amount of [3H]TdR incorporated. Acute administration of MMS (2-100 mg/kg) induced a strong, dose-related UDS response. The response was slightly higher with IP injection than with gavage. The UDS response after five daily doses of 50 mg MMS/kg was 20-30% higher than that induced by a single IP or gavage dose. Acute administration of TEM (0.05-4.0 mg/kg) by IP injection or gavage induced weak and variable responses. Retesting TEM using inbred C3Hf mice produced weak but exposure-related responses with both acute IP and gavage treatments. There was a slight increase in UDS response with subacute IP injection but not with subacute gavage. Acute testicular injection of TEM produced a higher but more variable UDS response. The study showed that gavage, as well as IP injection, can be used for the administration of test chemicals and that the subacute 5-day regimen induced a higher UDS response than the acute regimen. Furthermore, the testicular route may enhance the detection of weak UDS inducers.",M2

Other bile acids enhanced the mutagenic and recombinogenic effects of TEM. Chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid had stronger comutagenic than corecombinogenic effects; hyodeoxycholic acid did not show this difference. Ox gall and a mixture of bile acids antagonized the genotoxic effect of TEM, and it therefore seems plausible that in normal composition bile acids neutralize each other, i.e., the comutagenic (corecombinogenic) effect of one substance is antagonized by the antimutagenic (antirecombinogenic) effect of another one. However, when the composition is altered, bile acids may become harmful.

These 3 chemicals are triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>), mitomycin C, and cyclophosphamide. All three of these chemicals produced DNA damage which was readily detectable by alkaline elution. Both TEM and mitomycin C produced DNA interstrand cross-links, although TEM was a more potent cross-linker on an equimolar basis than mitomycin C. Cyclophosphamide produced both DNA cross-links and DNA strand breaks. Alkaline elution in the absence of proteinase K indicated that some of the strand breaks appeared to be closely associated with protein. These studied indicate that the alkaline elution technique is capable of detecting DNA damage in mammalian germ cells produced by chemical mutagens. This technique may prove useful as a screening tool for identifying chemicals which cause heritable mutations in mammals.",M2

A dose of 0.01-1.0 mumol of TEM applied once a week for 32 weeks to the skin of the backs of mice did not produce any detectable tumors. A dose of 2.5 mumol applied once a week over the same period produced only a single papilloma in a group of 20 mice. However, when mice were treated with a single dose of 1 mumol of TEM followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) twice a week, 88% of the mice produced papillomas after 28 weeks. Using the same protocol, a single application of hexamethylmelamine (HMM), pentamethylmelamine (PMM), or melamine followed by promotion with TPA had no significant tumor initiating activity.

7266560,"Effect of caffeine on the frequency of chromosome aberrations induced in vivo by triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) and adriamycin (ADR) in mice.The effect of caffeine on the chromosomal aberrations induced in vivo by TEM and ADR was studied. BALB/c mice were treated intraperitoneally according to the schedule summarized in Table 1. Animals injected only with caffeine exhibited a significant increase in the frequency of gaps with the doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg and in the frequency of breaks with all the doses given. Treatments with TEM induced a significant increment of gaps, breaks and chromatid exchanges. ADR increased the frequency of gaps and breaks and induced centric fusions. Combined treatments with TEM plus caffeine evidenced the potentiating ability of the latter drug. Conversely, in mice injected with ADR and caffeine, only the frequency of centric fusions was increased. These results could be explained by assuming that: (1) the primary lesions induced by ADR are not repaired by post-replication mechanisms; (2) the binding of ADR to the DNA molecule inhibits the unscheduled DNA synthesis necessary to perform the reparation of damaged segments. On the other hand, the increased frequency of biarmed chromosomes in ADR-caffeine treatments probably results from the induction of chromosomal stickiness of the heterochromatin regions.",M2

Similar modified responses to X-irradiation have now been observed in stem spermatogonia that are recovering from treatment with the chemical mutagen, TEM. (1) In contrast to a normal response to 900 R, high translocation yields were obtained when this dose was administered 24 h after a TEM treatment. (2) A small but non-significant increase above a normal response to 500 R was obtained when this dose followed 24 h after TEM treatment and a normal response to 500 R was obtained from the reverse order treatment (500 R + TEM). (3) When given 4 days after a TEM treatment, the translocation yield from 500 R was only about half that normally obtained. Unexpectedly, a similar low response was obtained from the reverse order treatment which, if verified, would suggest selective cell killing by the TEM. THe chemical administered alone, was almost totally ineffective in producing recoverable translocations in stem spermatogonia. Since it is unlikely that TEM and X-rays should similarly synchronize the cell cycle of surviving stem spermatogonia it is concluded that the modified genetic responses obtained result from a different cause. Depletion of the stem-cell population is suggested as the common mediating factor. This may 'trigger' the radio-resistant, long cycling stem cells into a more active cycle such that, 24--48 h later, survivors may be highly 'synchronized' into either a sensitive cell-cycle stage or transient state preparatory to entering a shorter cell cycle to achieve repopulation. The low translocations yields obtained with longer intervals between treatments may typify the genetic response of the repopulating stem cells.",M2

This relationship does not hold for isopropyl methanesulfonate (IMS), which induced only negligible frequencies of heritable translocations at doses that induced high levels of dominant lethal mutations.

A fairly high level of dominant lethals were observed in female guinea-pigs mated at the first oestrus after irradiation (23.4 +/- 6.4%) with a lower yield at 3 months (9.6 +/- 8.2%). Neither of the chemicals caused any significant induction of dominant lethals at either mating time. In the reproductive capacity experiments, the mean litter size of irradiated female guinea-pigs was reduced for about 12 months and this was especially marked in the first 6 months following treatment. Neither of the chemicals caused any significant differences in early litter sizes but there was a noticeable reduction in the litter sizes of TEM-treated females in the 18--24 month interval. With Djungarian hamsters a marked effect of X-rays on reproductive capacity was apparent. After 400 rad a smaller proportion of irradiated females littered in the first 25-day interval than after the other treatments, and no irradiated females produced more than one litter. Neither of the chemicals caused such a drastic reduction in fertility but TEM-treated females produced fewer litters and became sterile at an earlier age than control or IPMS-treated females. With IPMS, the number of litters produced was similar to the controls.

162283,"<e>TEM</e>-induced gene mutations at enzyme loci in the mouse.Strain DBA/2J male mice were treated with triethylenemelamine (TEM) and subsequently mated to strain C57BL/6J females. Tissues from F1 progeny produced in these crosses were then examined using starch gel electrophoresis for the presence of presumed induced mutations at a series of 11 specific enzyme loci. In the course of this study, four heritable mutations were identified at the following loci: Es-1, Ldh-1, Pgm-1, and Gpi-1. Of these four, the first two were apparently segregating in parental males and were not TEM-induced. Both of these are viable and fertile in the heterozygous and homozygous condition, and neither confers any readily apparent deleterious effect to the animal. The latter mutations (Pgm-1 and Gpi-1) are presumably induced. Although viable and fertile in the heterozygous state, we have not recovered any offsping homozygous for either of these two mutations.",M2
732859,"Expression of <e>TEM</e>-induced damage to postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis of the mouse during early embryogenesis. II. Cytological investigations.After treatment of postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis of the mouse with TEM (0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg), dose- and stage-of-spermatogenesis-dependent frequencies of cytogenetic aberrations can be observed in early embryos. The frequencies of first-cleavage metaphases exhibiting structural aberrations (all of the chromosome type), the frequencies of 2 cell embryos and of 4--8 cell embryos containing nuclei accompanied by micronuclei or nuclei connected by bridges show a close correlation to frequencies of preimplantation loss of embryos recorded in a dominant lethal test. The frequencies of morulae/blastulae exhibiting blastomeres with micronuclei show a close correlation to the frequencies of total (pre- and post-implantation) loss of embryos. This indicates delayed expression of TEM-induced chromosomal damage which could persist undetected in very early stages of embryogenesis.",M2

The present study demonstrates the utility of a fish, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), as a model test system in which water-borne chemical mutagens may be assayed for dominant lethal effects. Mature male guppies were injected with three doses of triethylenemelamine (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) in addition to a control sham treatment. Each male was subsequently mated to virgin females. In an alternative test, male fish were allowed to swim in triethylenemelamine solutions of known concentration for a period of 24 h prior to being mated to virgin female guppies. 10 days following matings, females were dissected, and numbers of live and dead embryos were recorded.

All males treated with TEM were fertile,and cytological analysis of meiotic cells showed no chromosomal rearrangements. Semi-sterility and sterility were noted in F1 sons of TEM-treated animals. This semi-sterility and sterility were associated with reciprocal translocations.

Potential translocation carriers among F1 males were selected after two breedings and confirmed by cytogenetic analysis. Translocation heterozygotes were obtained in offspring of the TEM-treated groups, but not in the control groups. In F1 males produced from the first week of mating, the frequencies of translocations were 0, 1.78 6.2 and 10.0% for the control group and groups receiving TEM at 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.050 mg/kg/day, respectively, and in those produced from the third week of mating, the values were 0 and 2.1%, respectively, for the control group and the group receiving TEM at 0.050 mg/kg/day. F1 males from the second week of mating were not studied for the induction of heritable translocations. TEM-induced dominant lethality and heritable translocations were most prominent in the first week of mating after 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, heritable translocations appeared to be a more sensitive endpoint than dominant lethal mutations for the measurement of mutagenic effects of TEM.",M2

The ova were collected at intervals ranging from 12 h to 10.5 days after single intraperitoneal injection of TEM. Very few structural aberrations were seen in the metaphase-I cells after TEM treatment. There was, however, a very clear effect on the female genome when first cleavage mitoses were analyzed.

565312,"The production of chromosome aberrations in various mammalian cells by triethylenemelamine.The cytogenetic effects of triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) were studied using five different mammalian tissues. Treatments of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg TEM on differentiating mouse spermatogonia and bone marrow cells showed no significant differences in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations produced in these two tissues. At higher doses, however, the sensitivites of the two tissues appear to be different. The frequency of aberrations varies with time after treatment, with the greatest amount occurring at the latter fixation times. Results of an experiment on primary spermatocytes indicated a correlation between the frequency of chromosome aberrations and DNA replication. Human peripheral leukocytes were utilized in an attempt to clarify the cell-stage specificity of TEM-induced chromosome aberrations. Cultures were treated with TEM prior to PHA stimulation (G0), as well as various time intervals after stimulation (late G,1 S, and G2). The most sensitive stages of the cell cycle to aberration induction were later G1 and S, with chromatid aberrations the predominant type. A very low yield of chromosome damage was observed with the G0 and G1 treated stages. The experiments described tend to support the view that TEM is most effective at inducing aberrations when an intervening round of DNA replication has occurred.",M2

Investigations with in vitro embryo culture.After treatment of postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis of the mouse with TEM, dose and stage of spermatogenesis-dependent disturbances of the early embryonic development can be observed both in vivo and after in vitro culture of the embryos. The observations in both systems can be correlated. The embryo-culture system thereby enables analysis of the expression of mutagen-induced damage more accurately than the in vivo dominant lethal test. With the doses used (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) TEM-treatment of the fathers did not affect the rate of fertilized and cleaving eggs during the first three weeks post-treatment but severely disturbed the further development of the embryos at all stages up to implantation, exhibiting a maximum effect on morulae.",M2

A preliminary workshop was held to resolve scoring differences, to develop a joint protocol and common glossary, and to reach agreement on uniform reporting methods. Osborne-Mendel rats from a common source were sent to each laboratory. Triethylenemelamine (<e>TEM</e>) was used at doses of 100, 200, 300 and 400 microgram/kg to induce clastogenic effects; results were compared to those of a control group of untreated animals. Femoral bone marrow cells were evaluated with the scorers unaware of the dosage. Final results showed highly significant dose effects with the test compound, and most laboratories showed a similar pattern of dose response. This study illustrates that rat cytogenetic analysis can be an effective test system for evaluation of a compound for mutagenic potential, particularly for the index reflecting the proportion of abnormal cells, but that results should be interpreted cautiously when arbitrary values are assigned for some of the categories being analyzed, as was done in this project for the category of severely damaged cells.",M2

Decreases in the number of implants per pregnant female were noted during this same period, with only minor decreases in fertility. In contrast, oral injections of TEM resulted in only fluctuations in the percent of fetal mortality.

The mortality and the fertility of the treated females were recorded. The rate of dominant lethals, of entire sex chromosome loss and partial loss of the Y chromosome, the sex ratio, and the rate of mosaics were determined on the progency.

These males were mated with untreated females twice a week during 24 days after the treatment. On day 3 of gestation, embryos were flushed out from uteri and examined cytologically as well as cytogenetically. A dominant-lethal test was conducted using the male treated in the same way. Paternal treatment of TEM caused developmental retardation of the embryos obtained from the matings on 20 post-injection days. These embryos frequently showed micronuclei in interphase cells and structural chromosome aberrations in methaphases. Most of these aberrations were chromosome types, such as breaks and exchanges, and premature chromosome condensations. The developmental retardation as well as the frequency of chromosome aberrations was most marked in the matings on post-injection day 13. Similarly, the highest dominant-lethal effect was shown in the group mated on post-injection days 11--13. It was concluded that TEM induces chromosome damage in the post-meiotic germ cells and then this damage in turn produces chromosome aberrations in the embryos, resulting in high incidence of dominant lethality.",M2

These doses induced comparably high dominant lethal effects in pachytene spermatocytes of mice. Cytological analysis at diakinesis-metaphase I stage showed that whereas 76.4% of the cells treated with X rays at pachytene stage had aberrations, the frequencies observed in two TEM experiments were only 0.8 and 2.2%. On the other hand, 5% of the progeny from TEM-treated pachytene spermatocytes were found to be translocation heterozygotes. This is the first report on the recovery of heritable translocations from treated spermatocytes of mice. The aberration frequencies observed for TEM in diakinesis-metaphase I were much too low to account for all the lethal mutations and heritable translocations. Thus, the formation of the bulk of aberrations induced by TEM in pachytene spermatocytes was delayed--a marked contrast to the more immediate formation of X-ray-induced aberrations. It is postulated that the formation of the bulk of TEM-induced aberrations in pachytene spermatocytes and in certain postmeiotic stages occurs sometime during spermiogenesis, and not through the operation of postfertilization pronuclear DNA synthesis.",M2

Elevation of DNase I- and protein content of the kidneys and a (short-dated) increase of incorporation of 14C-phenylalamine into microsomes of liver of 14C-orotic acid into RNA of liver and kidney suggest that the influence of 6-MU is mediated at least partly by a specfically anabolic effect.",M2

The pattern of sensitivity differed with the chemical. IMS was most effective when pronuclear formation was already completed and the majority of the zygotes were presumably undergoing DNA synthesis. EMS, on the other hand, induced its most pronounced effects when eggs in the course of second meiotic division and zygotes in early pronuclear stages were treated. The greatest effect of TEM was observed when zygotes were treated at the early pronuclear stage. EMS and TEM, in contrast to IMS, are similar to radiations in that zygotes undergoing DNA synthesis are more resistant to them than are the early pronuclear stages. In the case of IMS, effects induced in the most sensitive postcopulation-precleavage stage were 6 to 9 times greater than in the most sensitive precopulatory dictyate oocytes or male germ cells. On the other hand, in the case of EMS and TEM, the most sensitive precopulatory male germ cells, but not the dictyate oocytes, were more sensitive than the most sensitive postcopulation stages.",M2

Dose-levels of TEM which do not affect fertilization but yield high incidence of dominant-lethal mutations in sperm and spermatids were shown to produce relatively high frequencies of (a) premature chromosome condensation (PCC), (b) structural chromosome anomalies (breakage-reunion phenomena), and (c) micronuclei in these embryos. The results indicate that genetic death of embryos is mainly due to imbalance (i.e. loss) of genetic material, either from breaks leading to lagging fragments and micronuclei, or from the segregation of various types of exchange figures (dicentrics, rings etc.) resulting in mechanical disturbances of cleavage division. It is suggested that PCC, to some extent, is an expression of TEM-induced long-lived lesions which, transmitted into the egg, prevent the chromosomes in question from replicating and/or condensing normally. This phenomenon could well be associated with loss of chromosome material resulting in embryonic death.",M2

The procedure followed was that of Matter and Schmid with the following modifications: (a) direct flushing of bone marrow with 0.2 ml calf fetal serum. (b) air drying slides for a period of only I h, and (c) the use of pH 6.0 phosphate buffer to dilute both Wright and Giemsa stains. With this technique a dose response curve was generated for both TMP and TEM, using mice as the experimental animal. With TMP, a doubling over background was found when a concentration of 0.5 g/kg per day for five days was administered. To establish a statistically significant doubling dose over the control, a minimum of five animals must be used with 2000 polychromatic cells being analyzed per animal. Of the two antischistosomal agents tested, hycanthone yielded an increase of 20-fold in the number of micronuclei over control at 40 mg/kg administered i.p. for five days, while with niridazole no increase in micronuclei at several concentrations tested both by single and multiple injection was found.

The animals were slaughtered on day 9 or pregnancy. Corpora lutea and living and dead embryos were counted to estimate embryonic loss. Thereafter chromosome-analysis of bone marrow cells and embryonic tissue took place. Highter TEM dosage increased the rate of embryonic loss. It increased from 28.1% with a dose of 3 X 0.4 mg TEM to 75.7% with 3 X 0.6 mg TEM. The level of embryonic loss depends on the time of treatment during different stages of early gestation.

The flies were raised from larvae which had been treated with 1630 R of X-rays at the age of 48-52 hours. An additional group of wa/wa females and wa males came from larvae that had been fed with triethylene melamine (TEM) at the age of 22-24 hours. The twin spots apparently were the result of induced unequal mitotic recombination, i.e. from unequal sister-strand recombination in the males and from unequal sister-strand recombination as well as, possibly, unequal recombination between homologous strands in the females. That is, a duplication resulted in waDp wa/wa dark-apricot ommatidia and the corresponding deficiency in an adjacent area of wa/Df wa light-apricot ommatidia. In an additional experiment sister-strand mitotic recombination in the ring-X chromosome of ring-X/rod-X females heterozygous for w and wco is believed to be the cause for X-ray induced single mosaic spots that show the phenotype of the rod-X marker.",M2

The pattern of effects on spermatocytes, unlike midspermatids and early spermatozoa, indicated possible cytotoxic damage, so for the determination of TEM dose-response curves in the induction of genetic damage only the data for midspermatids and early spermatozoa were used. The TEM dose-effect curves for those two stages differ markedly from ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) dose-effect curves. Beginning with the lowest doses at which significant effects are observed, there is a considerably more rapid increase in dominant-lethal effects with dose of EMS than TEM. Another marked difference between the two compounds is in the ratio of the genetically effective dose (as measured by dominant-lethal mutations) to the lethal dose. The ratio is 1:100 for TEM and only 1:3.5 for EMS; thus, TEM is mutagenic far below its toxic level. Obviously, these results have important implications not only for our understanding of the nature of chemical induction and recovery of chromosomal aberrations but also for the practical problems of evaluating the mutagenic effects of chemicals.",M2
