17911646,"OX40 controls functionally different T cell subsets and their resistance to depletion therapy.T cell depletion is a widely used approach in clinical transplantation. However, not all T cells are equally sensitive to depletion therapies and a significant fraction of T cells persists even after aggressive treatment. The functional attributes of such T cells and the mechanisms responsible for their resistance to depletion are poorly studied. In the present study, we showed that CD4(+) T cells that are resistant to polyclonal anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) mediated depletion exhibit phenotypic features of memory cells and uniformly express OX40 on the cell surface. Studies using the foxp3gfp knockin mice revealed that the remaining CD4(+)OX40(+) cells consist of Foxp3(+) Tregs and Foxp3(-) T effector/memory cells. The ALS-resistant CD4(+)OX40(+) cells failed to mediate skin allograft rejection upon adoptive transferring into congenic Rag(-/-) mice, but removal of Foxp3(+) Tregs from the OX40(+) cells resulted in prompt skin allograft rejection. Importantly, OX40 is critical to survival of both Foxp3(+) Tregs and T effector/memory cells. However, OX40 exhibits opposing effects on the functional status of Foxp3(+) Tregs and T effector/memory cells, as stimulation of OX40 on T effector cells induced amplified cell proliferation but stimulation of OX40 on the Foxp3(+) Tregs impaired their suppressor functions. Our study demonstrates that OX40 is a critical molecule in regulating survival and functions of depletion-resistant T cells; and these findings may have important clinical implications.",M1
16904981,"Abrogation of recurrent autoimmunity in the NOD mouse: A critical role for host interleukin 4.BACKGROUND: We previously established a clinically relevant strategy to abrogate recurrent autoimmunity and enable long-term islet graft survival, involving antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>)-depletion of recipient T cells and intraportal administration of donor pancreatic lymph node cells (PLNCs) along with islet grafts. In this study, we investigated whether Th2 cytokines were required for the tolerizing ability of ALS/PLNC treatment in islet transplantation. METHODS: ALS-treated diabetic NOD recipient mice, and NOD recipient mice deficient in interleukin 4 (IL-4-/-) or 10 (IL-4/10-/-) were transplanted with NOR or NOD.scid islets intraportally along with donor PLNC. Blood glucose levels were monitored to access graft function, sections of graft-bearing livers were histologically examined, and ELISPOT assays were used to assess cytokine profile and frequency of islet-reactive CD4 T cells. RESULTS: We found that ALS/PLNC was not effective in prolonging islet graft survival in diabetic NOD hosts deficient in either IL-4 (NOD.IL-4-/-) or in IL-4 and IL-10 (NOD.IL4-/-/10-/-) (mean survival time, 36 days), contrasting the long-term survival of islet grafts in wild-type NOD mice (mean survival time, &gt; 80 days). In contrast, PLNC deficient in IL-4 promoted long-term graft survival in wild-type NOD hosts similar to that in wild-type PLNC. In wild-type NOD recipients of either wild-type PLNC or IL-4-/- PLNC, the host autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells produced predominately IL-4 coincident with long-term graft survival, whereas, in NOD.IL-4-/- recipients with rejected grafts, the autoreactive T cells produced interferon gamma and low amounts of IL-4. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that abrogation of recurrent autoimmunity requires host IL-4 and that manipulation of the autoreactive cytokine profile in long-term diabetes may be an effective strategy for islet transplant therapies.",M1
16713179,"Short administration of polyclonal anti-T cell antibody (<e>ALS</e>) in NOD mice with extensive insulitis prevents subsequent development of autoimmune diabetes.Treatment of overtly diabetic NOD mice with antilymphocyte serum (ALS), a polyclonal anti-T cell antibody, leads to cure of diabetes. Here, we investigated whether ALS-treatment of NOD mice after development of extensive insulitis prevents onset of diabetes. Female NOD mice were treated with two doses of ALS at 14, 19 or 23 weeks of age. No further treatment was given. In untreated female NOD mice, diabetes developed starting at 13 weeks and reached 68% by 37 weeks. ALS-treatment at 14, 19 or 23 weeks when histology showed progressive insulitis completely prevented onset of overt diabetes in 9/12, 11/12 or 12/12 mice, respectively. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests in 43 week-old ALS-treated, diabetes-free mice showed a normal pattern. Co-adoptive transfer of lymphoid cells prepared from ALS-treated diabetes-free mice together with splenocytes from overtly diabetic NOD mice resulted in marked delay in diabetes onset in NOD.SCID mice, suggesting the presence of autoimmune regulatory cells in ALS-treated mice. Autoimmune regulatory cells were CD4(+)CD25(+), but not CD4(+)CD25(-), T cells. Thus, treatment of euglycemic individuals who already show signs of autoimmune diabetes with a short course of polyclonal anti-T cell antibody may effectively prevent onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",M1
16547248,"CD4+ regulatory T cells are spared from deletion by antilymphocyte serum, a polyclonal anti-T cell antibody.Broad T cell depletion has been used as an integral part of treatment in transplantation and autoimmune diseases. Following depletion, residual T cells undergo homeostatic proliferation and convert to memory-like T cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of T cell depletion by antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), a polyclonal anti-T cell Ab, on CD4(+) regulatory T cells. After ALS treatment, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells underwent proliferation and expressed a memory T cell marker, CD44. One week after ALS treatment, both CD25(+) and CD25(-) T cells exhibited increased suppression of alloresponses in vitro, which waned thereafter to the levels mediated by naive CD25(+) and CD25(-) T cells. By real-time PCR analyses, ALS treatment of CD4-deficient mice adoptively transferred with Thy1.2(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) and Thy1.1(+)CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(-) T cells resulted in the appearance of Thy1.2(+)CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(+) and Thy1.1(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells, suggesting the conversion between CD25(+) and CD25(-) T cells. Naive CD25(+) T cells expressed a higher level of intracellular Bcl-x(L) than CD25(-) T cells. Up-regulation of the Bcl-x(L) molecule during ALS-induced homeostatic expansion further promoted survival of CD25(+) and, to a lessor degree, CD25(-) cells. These results indicate that CD25(+) T cells are spared from ALS-mediated deletion, with some CD25(+) T cells converting to CD25(-) T cells, and continue to exhibit regulatory activity. The concomitant presence of T cell deletion and continuous regulatory T cell activity may underlie the therapeutic effect of ALS, particularly in treatment of autoimmune diseases.",M1
16297056,"The effect of anti-lymphocyte serum on subpopulations of blood and tissue leucocytes: possible supplementary mechanisms for suppression of rejection and the development of opportunistic infections.Xenogeneic anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) remains a major reagent for immunosuppression in clinical practice, but mechanisms of action and risks of opportunistic infection have not been considered in the context of innate immunity and its role in immune responsiveness. Rabbit anti rat ALS was administered intraperitoneally. Blood was taken for flow cytometry to establish absolute counts of leucocyte subsets. Tissues were harvested for immunohistology to evaluate interstitial dendritic cells and tissue macrophages. At day 2 of ALS therapy, T cells are completely depleted, as anticipated. B cells are undiminished and form approximately 90% of blood leucocytes. Monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are substantially (approximately 80%), but not completely, depleted, and there is a trend for diminished numbers of putative dendritic cells. Neither interstitial dendritic cells nor tissue macrophages in heart are affected. The results at day 7 were very similar to day 2. Substantial depletion of blood monocytes and NK cells might attenuate the innate immune system, and represent a possible supplementary mechanism (in addition to T cell depletion) for suppression of rejection. It might be of particular importance in reducing defences against infections. Monitoring these parameters could be of clinical value.",M1
16201179,"[Induced tolerance to cardiac allografts with intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells]OBJECTIVE: To study the methods and mechanisms of immune tolerance in cardiac transplantation. METHODS: Male DA rat hearts were transplanted to male Lewis rats using Ono's model and randomly divided into four groups: untreated (group I), intrathymic injection of 2.5 x 10(7) DA splenocytes to Lewis rat (group II), intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) to Lewis recipient (group III), intrathymic injection of 2.5 x 10(7) DA splenocytes combined with intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (ALS) to Lewis recipient (group IV). 21 days later heart transplantation was performed. Mean survival time (MST), histological changes and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) were measured after operation. RESULTS: In the group of intrathymic injection of spleen cells combined with ALS treatment, the survival time of heart allografts [MST: (81.8 +/- 7.6)d] was significantly longer than in the groups I [MST: (7.3 +/- 1.0) d], group II [MST:(7.8+/- 1.0)d], and group III [MST(8.2 +/- 1.2) d, P &lt; 0.01]. Only a few inflammatory cells infiltrated in cardiac allografts in group IV. MLR of group IV were significantly decreased compared with those of the normal control (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The role of thymus as a special site for induction and maintenance of specific immunological unresponsiveness to organ allografts was confirmed. T cell clonal deletion may play an important role in this immune tolerance.",M1
16042064,"[The role of polyclonal anti-T-lymphocyte antibodies (ATG) in the kidney transplantation]The successes in the kidney transplantation are closely connected with the successes of the immunology and the advance of the immunosuppressive therapy. The main task of the modern immunosuppressive therapy is the insurance of medicines with a minimum nephro-toxicity, and the optimum protection regarding the adoptive body against an early reaction of rejection. The polycomponent anti-T-limphocitic antibodies (ATG) give us the opportunity of that. The polycomponent anti-T-limphocitic antibodies or the antilimphocitic serum (<e>ALS</e>) are xenogenetic polycomponent antibodies, that are directed to the human T-limphocites, i.e. antitimocitic globuline (ATG). They are received by immunization of rabbits or horses with human thymus limphoid cells. They are received for the first time by horses, and later on by rabbits. The last patent medicines have more powerful effect. In spite of the side effects of the polycomponent ATG, the patent medicine is used for inductive treatment after transplantation of organs and for a treatment of acutely rejection of the graft. We have treated 15 patients after kidney transplantation with ATG for a period of an year in the ward of kidney transplantation in The Clinic of Urology. The patients with transplantation are at the age of 21 to 50 years old, and by sex--11 male and 4 female patients. 9 of them are transplanted from alive donor and 6--from a dead body. We have applied the patent medicine of ATG Timoglobuline in a phial of 5 mg\ml intravenally in a bank of 500 ml physiological solution according to the weight and the blood test of the patients. We have applied a fourfold immunosuppressive therapy: Urbazon, Imuran, CyA(Neoral) +ATG. CONCLUSIONS: ATG is a mixture of monocomponent polyspecific antibodies, which, in spite of its side effects, has been applied successfully in transplantation for more than 30 years. In the course of many years anti-CD3 patent medicine OKT3 has been the only one monocomponent antibody for the treatment of an acute rejection of the graft for inductive therapy in transplanted patients.A chimerical (baziliksimab) and humanized (daklizumab) monocomponent antibodies of the alpha-chain of the receptor for IL-2 (CD25) are used for the prophylaxis of the episodes of acutely rejection of the transplanted kidney during the last 10 years. ATG does not consists of anti-CD25 antibodies. That is why the simultaneously application of ATG with baziliksimab or daklizumab is expected to have an additional effect with a complementary mechanism of efficacy.",M1
15919414,"The immunologic function of 1B2+ double negative (CD4-CD8-) T cells in the 2C transgenic mouse.BACKGROUND: 2C mice bearing the cytotoxic TCR for class I L(d) on a C57BL/6 (B6) background have a preponderance of 1B2+CD8+ T cells directed against L(d). These naive CD8+ T cells are not directly cytotoxic without prior in vivo or in vitro activation. However, after in vitro sensitization, they become highly cytotoxic and will acutely and specifically reject a tolerant L(d+) BALB/c heart graft. Anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) treatment eliminates CD4+ and CD8+ cells and a large double negative (CD4-CD8-) 1B2+ non-cytotoxic transgenic cell population remains. The immunological function of this unique peripheral population of T cells is investigated in the 2C transgenic mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the activation characteristics of the 2C CD4-CD8- T cells, 2C peripheral T cells were analyzed for 1B2+, CD8+, and CD4+ marker by FACS before and 48-h after 0.5 cc ALS i.p. Similarly, in vitro, the response of these 2C CD4-CD8- T cells remaining after deletion of mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with ALS plus complement were evaluated by mixed lymphocyte culture and cytotoxic T lymphocyte after 7 days culture with BALB/c, IL-2, or BALB/c + IL-2. Parallel experiments were performed with control non-transgenic B6 mice. Following in vitro culture with BALB/c + IL-2, 2C CD4-CD8- T cells were injected into B6 mice with a tolerant BALB/c heart (tolerization via anti-CD4 mAb and intrathymic BALB/c) to determine their immunogenicity. RESULTS: While peripheral T cells in control B6 mice have &lt;5% CD4-CD8- cells, transgenic 2C mice have a significantly increased percentage at 29 to 35% (P &lt; 0.01). After the deletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with either in vivo or in vitro ALS, 2C CD4-CD8- T cells increased to 96 to 99%. After 7-day culture, the 2C CD4-CD8- T cells decreased again to 33 to 38%. Simultaneously, 2C CD8+ T cells decreased from 56 to 62% to 0.1 to 3% after ALS treatment, but again increased to 61 to 70% after in vitro culture. Untreated 2C cells responded to IL-2 or BALB/c antigen equally well. However, after ALS treatment, CD4-CD8- T cells responded to IL-2 and IL-2 plus antigen, but not BALB/c antigen alone. Finally, CD4-CD8- T cells cultured for 7 days with BALB/c + IL-2 rejected the tolerant BALB/c heart in 5.3 +/- 0.3 days. CONCLUSION: In the periphery of transgenic 2C mice is a unique CD4-CD8- population of T cells bearing the transgenic specific marker 1B2. These non-cytotoxic cells can be optimally stimulated to develop marked specific L(d) cytotoxicity in parallel with the expression of the CD8+ epitope.",M1
15808566,"Effect of streptavidin on cardiac allograft prolongation is due to host T-Cell suppression.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of streptavidin immunomodulation in the high-responder WF-to-Lewis combination. METHODS/RESULTS: We examined the effects of streptavidin on the proliferative response of T cells in coculture studies. Two to 200 microg/mL streptavidin significantly (P &lt; .001) suppressed the proliferation of Lewis T cells to WF by 76%-83% compared with untreated responders. Next, we studied the survival of WF cardiac allografts in Lewis recipients pretreated with streptavidin. A 5-day course of peritransplantation recipient treatment with streptavidin doses of 8, 12, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg combined with single dose of 0.5 mL antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) significantly (P &lt; .001) prolonged cardiac allograft survival from MST of 7 +/- 0.5 and 8 +/- 0.5 days in naive and ALS-treated controls to 15 +/- 1, 20 +/- 3, 16 +/- 3, 17 +/- 3, and 23 +/- 2 days, respectively. In contrast, posttransplantation administration of 80 mg/kg streptavidin resulted in animal death, suggesting toxicity of this dose. Additionally, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg streptavidin administration for 10 consecutive days resulted in significant graft prolongation (MST of 18 +/- 1 and 21 +/- 1 days, respectively; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Although peritransplantation streptavidin treatment is effective in prolonging rat cardiac allografts in the high-responder WF-to-Lewis combination, it does not induce permanent graft survival as observed in the low-responder combination of Lewis-to-ACI. Our finding of in vitro immunomodulatory effect of streptavidin on T-cell proliferation suggests that its in vivo effect is partly due to prevention of T-cell activation following antigen exposure.",M1
15548965,"Targeted T-cell depletion or CD154 blockade generates mixed hemopoietic chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in mice treated with sirolimus and donor bone marrow.BACKGROUND: The administration of donor specific bone marrow (DSBM) to mice conditioned with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and sirolimus can result in stable multilineage mixed chimerism and long-term graft survival. This study seeks to determine if either the targeted depletion of CD4 and/or CD8 pos T cells or costimulation blockade can substitute for ALS and preserve the efficacy of this regimen. METHODS: C57BL/6 recipients of BALB/c skin allografts were treated with DSBM (150 x 10(6) cells), sirolimus (24 mg/kg intraperitonealy), and either ALS or various monoclonal antibodies (alphaCD4, alphaCD8, alphaCD154 alone or in combination). Recipient peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) depletion, donor chimerism, and deletion of donor reactive T cells were assessed using flow cytometry. The specificity of immunologic nonreactivity and the presence of immunoregulatory activity were assessed through a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. RESULTS: The administration of ALS, sirolimus, and DSBM resulted in sustained recipient PBMC depletion, transient chimerism, and prolonged graft survival. The substitution of an equivalent degree and duration of targeted depletion of either CD4 or CD8 pos T cells alone for ALS failed to produce chimerism or prolonged graft survival. In contrast, depletion of both CD4 and CD8 pos T cells resulted in durable multilineage chimerism, indefinite allograft acceptance (&gt;350 days), and donor-specific tolerance to secondary skin grafts. Substitution of alphaCD154 monoclonal antibody for ALS also resulted in a state of mixed chimerism and donor specific tolerance. This tolerant state appears to be maintained at least partially through clonal deletion and suppression. CONCLUSION: Either combined CD4 and CD8 T-cell depletion or alphaCD154 blockade can effectively substitute for ALS in producing chimerism and tolerance in this model.",M1
15385800,"Active role of chimerism in transplantation tolerance induced by antilymphocyte serum, sirolimus, and bone-marrow-cell infusion.BACKGROUND: A regimen consisting of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), sirolimus, and donor bone-marrow-cell (BMC) infusion induces indefinite skin allograft survival across fully mismatched mouse strain combinations. We investigated the role of chimerism in this transplantation tolerance model. MATERIALS: B10.A (H-2a) mice were treated with ALS on day -1 and 2, sirolimus, and infusion of (C57BL/6xDBA/2)F1 (B6D2F1, H-2(b/d)) BMCs on day 7 relative to DBA/2 (D2) skin grafting on day 0. At postgraft days 30, 50 and 120, the recipient mice were injected intravenously with splenocytes prepared from either naive or D2 mixed chimeric B10.A mice that had been sensitized in vivo to B6. Changes in chimerism and graft survival were monitored. RESULTS: Although D2 skin grafts were rejected with a median survival time of 63.8 days in B10.A mice given ALS and sirolimus alone, they survived more than 200 days in all B10.A mice given ALS, sirolimus, and B6D2F1 BMCs. Chimerism became evident 21 days postgrafting and progressively increased thereafter to 20% at postgraft day 200. Infusion of anti-B6 presensitized cells resulted in depletion of chimeric donor cells and subsequent graft rejection regardless of the timing of injection. Injection of presensitized cells in mice given ALS and sirolimus alone had no effect on graft survival. Injection of presensitized cells that were cytotoxic to alloantigen expressed by BMCs but tolerant to skin reduced, but did not deplete, established chimerism and allowed continued allograft survival. CONCLUSIONS: Chimeric donor cells play a major role in both the early and late phases of transplantation tolerance induced by the ALS, sirolimus, and BMC regimen.",M1
15331543,"Long-term islet graft survival in NOD mice by abrogation of recurrent autoimmunity.Islet transplantation has great potential for curing type 1 diabetes; however, long-term islet survival using conventional immunosuppression remains elusive. We present a novel strategy for inducing long-lasting islet graft survival in diabetic NOD mice in the absence of posttransplant immunosuppression by initial treatment with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) followed by coadministration of donor pancreatic lymph node cells (PLNCs). When treated with ALS/PLNC, diabetic NOD mice become normoglycemic and tolerated minor antigen-disparate islet grafts for &gt;100 days and syngeneic islet grafts indefinitely. Donor T-cells are required for graft prolongation, and tolerant hosts have long-term donor T-cell chimerism. Strikingly, host autoreactive T-cells from mice with long-surviving islet grafts predominantly produce interleukin-4, whereas autoreactive T-cells from mice that rejected their islet grafts predominantly produce interferon-gamma. We thus demonstrate a clinically relevant approach for ablation of recurrent autoimmunity in islet transplantation, involving donor lymphocyte-driven alteration of pathogenic autoreactive T-cells.",M1
15316366,"Potent skin allograft survival prolongation using a committed progenitor fraction of bone marrow in mice.BACKGROUND: The infusion of donor bone marrow (BM) into mice conditioned with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and sirolimus (Sir) prolongs skin allograft survival and produces chimerism. This study identifies the BM cell(s) responsible for this effect and determines whether enrichment for these cells will improve efficacy. METHODS: Skin grafts from BALB/C mice were transplanted into C57BL/6 or C57BL/10 recipients by using ALS, Sir, and BM (or fractions). BM was fractionated by using immunomagnetic beads. Flow cytometry was used for phenotyping and detecting chimerism. RESULTS: The median graft survival in mice receiving 25 million BM cells was 61 days. Infusion of BM depleted of cells expressing CD19, CD3, CD11c, and c-kit had no effect on median graft survival, whereas infusion of fractions enriched for those cells resulted in median graft survival of 38, 48, 28, and 83 days, respectively. The administration of higher doses (4 x 10(6) and 8x10(6)) of fractions enriched for c-kit resulted in median graft survival of 124 and 197 days, respectively, without chimerism. This favorably compared with mice receiving 150 million BM cells that demonstrated transient mixed chimerism and a median graft survival of 190 days. The majority of cells in the c-kit+-enriched fraction expressed lineage markers. Removal of lineage positive cells from BM before infusion shortened median graft survival (90 days), indicating that the c-kit+ lin+ population is largely responsible for prolongation of graft survival. CONCLUSIONS: Cells enriched for C-kit+lin+ constitute approximately 5% of murine BM cells and are more potent than whole BM at prolonging skin allograft survival in mice treated with ALS and Sir.",M1
15220193,"Cure of overt diabetes in NOD mice by transient treatment with anti-lymphocyte serum and exendin-4.Treatment of overtly diabetic NOD mice with anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), a polyclonal anti-T-cell antibody, abrogates autoimmunity and achieves partial clinical remission. Here we investigated whether the addition of exendin-4, a hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and beta-cell replication and differentiation, improves induction of remission by ALS. Transient treatment of overtly diabetic NOD mice with ALS and exendin-4 achieved complete remission in 23 of 26 mice (88%) within 75 days, accompanied by progressive normalization of glucose tolerance, improved islet histology, increased insulin content in the pancreas, and insulin release in response to a glucose challenge. Syngeneic islets transplanted into mice cured by treatment with ALS plus exendin-4 remained intact, and cotransfer of lymphocytes from cured mice delayed diabetes induction by adoptive transfer, suggesting the long-lasting presence of autoimmune regulatory cells. Although ALS alone also achieved reversal of diabetes, the frequency of remission was low (40%). No treatment or exendin-4 alone failed to produce remission. These results show that exendin-4 synergistically augments the remission-inducing effect of ALS. The addition of beta-cell growth factors, such as exendin-4, to immunotherapy protocols with anti-T-cell antibodies presents a potential novel approach to the cure of patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes.",M1
12858248,"Extension of composite tissue allograft survival across major histocompatibility barrier under short course of anti-lymphocyte serum and cyclosporine a therapy.In this study, the authors investigated the effects of combined use of cyclosporine A (CsA) and anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) on the survival of rat hindlimb allografts across a fully allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) barrier between Brown-Norway rats (BN, RT1 n) and Lewis rats (LEW, RT1 l). Thirty transplantations were performed in five groups of six rats each: Group 1 was the isograft control; Group 2 was the allograft control; Group 3 received ALS, Group 4 received CsA, and Group 5 received CsA and ALS. Treatment was started 2 hr before surgery and was then given for 21 days. Donor-derived chimerism was monitored by FACS analysis. Survival time was calculated as the number of post-transplant days until the first signs of rejection. The allografts in Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4 survived a mean of 5, 6, and 33 days, respectively. The longest mean survival time-51 days-was noted in Group 5 (p&lt;0.05). Donor- derived chimerism peaked at 17 percent and fell to 0 percent at the time of rejection. A combined protocol of ALS/CsA extended survival of rat hindlimb allografts across a fully allogeneic MHC barrier.",M1
12792521,"Immunoprotection of rat islet xenografts by cotransplantation with sertoli cells and a single injection of antilymphocyte serum.BACKGROUND: Islet transplantation has become a clinical reality; however, before it can be extended to young juvenile diabetics an unlimited supply of tissue is needed and the use of chronic immunosuppression should be eliminated. This study was designed to determine whether Sertoli cells can immunoprotect islet xenografts. METHODS: Lewis rat islets were cotransplanted with Balb/c Sertoli cells in diabetic Balb/c mice treated with one injection of anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). RESULTS: When islets were transplanted alone, in combination with Sertoli cells, or in combination with ALS, mean graft survival times were 10.9+/-0.8, 14.0+/-1.2, or 12.2+/-0.7, respectively. When islets were combined with Sertoli cells and ALS, mean graft survival time increased to 64.9+/-8.1. CONCLUSIONS: Sertoli cells are able to prolong the survival of islet xenografts when combined with ALS, thereby supporting their use as a means to immunoprotect cellular grafts such as islets for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",M1
12792518,"Chimerism and tolerance in rat recipients of intestinal allografts from <e>ALS</e>-treated donors with and without adjunct naïve-donor-strain bone-marrow cells.BACKGROUND: BN --&gt; LEW small-intestine transplantation (SITx) given a 28-day course of tacrolimus results in partial tolerance and prolonged alloengraftment despite the development of indolent chronic rejection (CR). We determined whether the CR was associated with the quantity or quality of passenger leukocytes contained in the unmodified or antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-depleted BN intestine at the time of transplantation, and with the subsequent migration and persistence of these donor leukocytes in the LEW recipients (chimerism). METHODS: Four experimental cohorts were defined by differences of the BN allografts and by the infusion (or not) of naïve donor (bone marrow cells [BMC]) on the day of the BN --&gt; LEW SITx. All LEW recipients were treated with the same 28-day course of tacrolimus. The LEW animals received: (1) unaltered intestine; (2) intestine from ALS-treated donor; (3) intestine from ALS-treated donor plus BMC from naive BN donor on day 0; and (4) unaltered intestine and BMC from unmodified (naïve) BN donor. RESULTS: Blood chimerism during the first 2 weeks after transplantation was lowest in the recipients of intestine from ALS-treated donors (groups 2 and 3), apparently because of the nearly complete elimination from the bowel of alphabetaTCR+ passenger leukocytes. After 2 weeks posttransplant to 5 months, greater than 2% of circulating donor cells were seen in animals given adjunct BMC from naïve BN donors (groups 3 and 4); this was associated with the absence of CR in the intestinal allografts. With lower levels of chimerism, moderate CR including arteritis and fibrosis in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes was found in the intestinal grafts of all group 1 and group 2 animals. Nevertheless, the CR-prone recipients in groups 1 and 2 had equivalent weight gain for greater than or equal to 150 days as in the CR-free groups 3 and 4. Detailed tissue chimerism studies in groups 1 to 3 showed that most of the donor cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues were rapidly replaced, but that the residual donor constituency of up to 6% in the allografts of group 3 was nearly 10-fold greater at 150 days than in groups 1 and 2 and closely reflected the findings in blood. CONCLUSION: The development of CR in intestinal allografts to which the recipients are partially tolerant is associated with a decline with time of donor-leukocyte chimerism. Multilineage chimerism in the recipient, and a similar profile of donor cells in the allografts, is better achieved with infused donor BMC than with the normal intestinal passenger leukocytes of the intestine. The difference may be because of a higher number of precursor and pluripotent stem cells in BMC.",M1
12544867,"Induction of tolerance to hind limb allografts in rats receiving cyclosporine A and antilymphocyte serum: effect of duration of the treatment.BACKGROUND: This study assessed the ability of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and cyclosporine A (CsA) to induce tolerance for hind limb composite tissue allograft in rats without chronic immunosuppression. METHODS: Hind limb transplantations were performed in Lewis-Brown-Norway (LBN, RT1(1+n)) and Lewis (LEW, RT1(1)) rats. Treatment consisted of ALS only (0.4 mL/kg), CsA only (16 mg/kg), and a combination of CsA and ALS, and it was administered 12 hr before surgery at three different intervals (7, 14, and 21 days). Long-term survivors were tested for tolerance by standard skin grafting from the recipient (LEW), the donor (LBN), and the third party (ACI, RT1 ) 60 days after cessation of the treatment and by mixed lymphocyte reaction at 100 days. T-cell lines were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Single use of ALS in all treatment intervals did not prolong allograft survival. Single use of CsA extended survival up to 23 days in the 21-day protocol group. CsA and ALS caused indefinite survival in two of six rats in the 14-day protocol and in all six rats in the 21-day protocol (&gt;420 days). The six long-term survivors in the 21-day protocol accepted the skin grafts from the donor (LBN) and the recipient (LEW) and rejected third-party grafts (ACI). Tolerant animals showed a donor-specific hematopoietic chimerism of 35% to 42% in the peripheral blood. Mixed lymphocyte reaction assay demonstrated tolerance to the host and donor alloantigens and increased response to the third party. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of CsA and ALS for 21 days induced donor-specific tolerance in the recipients of the rat hind limb composite tissue allografts. The mechanism of tolerance should be investigated further.",M1
12457363,"Induction of donor-specific tolerance in rat hind-limb allografts under antilymphocyte serum and cyclosporine A protocol.Composite tissue allograft (CTA) transplantation became a clinical reality despite major side effects associated with the administration of chronic immunosuppression. Development of new treatment modalities eliminating life-long immunosuppression is essential for the future of CTA transplantation. In this study, combined use of cyclosporine A (CsA) and antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) was tested for the potential to induce tolerance in the rat hind-limb allograft recipients across a major histocompatibility (MHC) barrier (Lewis-Brown-Norway [LBN, RT1(l+n)] to Lewis [LEW, RT1(l)] rats). Thirty transplantations were performed in 5 experimental groups. Animals received CsA and ALS 12 hours before surgery for 21 days thereafter. Although the allograft controls rejected their limbs at day 7 combined treatment of CsA and ALS resulted in indefinite survival (over 420 d) in all allograft recipients. Long-term survivors showed 35% to 42% of donor-specific chimerism in the peripheral blood. Clinical tolerance was confirmed by acceptance of the donor-specific skin grafts and immunocompetence was confirmed by rejection of the third-party grafts. Mixed lymphocyte reaction revealed suppressed response against donor-type antigens and increased response to third-party antigens. Donor-specific tolerance across MHC barrier was induced in CTA allografts under 21 days protocol of ALS/CsA.",M1
12352905,"Immunologic mechanisms in tolerance produced in mice with nonradiation-based lymphoablation and donor-specific bone marrow.BACKGROUND: These experiments evaluate the mechanisms associated with tolerance in mice treated with sirolimus, antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), and donor-specific bone marrow (BM). METHODS: Tolerance to fully MHC-incompatible skin allografts was induced as follows: C57Bl/10 (H2b) recipients received 0.5 mL of rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal ALS on days -1, +2, and +5 relative to B10.A (H2k) donor skin grafting on day 0. Sirolimus was given in a single dose (24 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on day 6. Freshly harvested B10.A (H2k) donor-specific BM was administered at a dose of 25 x 10(6) (ALS/BM25/sirolimus) or 150 x 10(6) (ALS/BM150/sirolimus) cells intravenously on day 7. Skin allograft survival was correlated with the recipient's immunologic status. Recipients were assayed for suppressor cell activity (mixed lymphocyte coculture assays), clonal deletion (T-cell receptor Vbeta11 assay), peripheral and thymic chimerism (flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), and anergy (response to exogenous interleukin 2). RESULTS: Mice treated with ALS/BM25/sirolimus showed specifically prolonged but not indefinite allograft survival (median survival time 116 days). Allograft survival correlated with donor-specific clonal deletion and the presence of donor class II mRNA in the recipient's thymus. Mice given the ALS/BM150/sirolimus protocol showed indefinite donor-specific tolerance. Tolerance could not be broken with the administration of high doses of interleukin 2. Splenocytes taken from mice 14 days after tolerance induction inhibited donor-specific and third-party mixed lymphocyte culture proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. This suppression could be ablated by depleting splenocytes of cells of donor origin before use in coculture. Clonal deletion was detectable 30 days after tolerance induction in mice treated with ALS/BM150/sirolimus and was maintained indefinitely. CONCLUSION: Induction of tolerance by ALS, BM, and sirolimus results in a state of donor-specific tolerance, and multilineage chimerism evolves that is permanent and associated with clonal deletion of alloreactive T cells.",M1
11579288,"Donor and recipient pretransplant conditioning with nonlethal radiation and antilymphocyte serum improves the graft survival in a rat small bowel transplant model.BACKGROUND: Lymphoid tissue within the intestinal graft require immunomodulatory strategies to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) after transplant. Herein, we evaluate the potential advantage of donor-specific bone marrow infusions in donor and or recipient preconditioned with total body irradiation and or antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) on the incidence of GVHD and rejection after small bowel transplantation. METHODS: Heterotopic SBTx was performed from DA to Lewis rats and distributed in nine groups: control group G0 (n=4) and G1 (n=6) without irradiation; recipients in G2 (n=4) were given 400 rd although in groups 3 (n=5), G4 (n=6), G6 (n=5), G7 (n=5), and G8 (n=6) with 250 rd. Donors in G5 (n=4) and G6 were given 250 rd of total body irradiation 2 hours before intestinal retrieval. Donors and recipients in G7 and donors in G8 additionally received ALS (day -5). G1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were infused with UDBM and G4 with the same amount of TCDBM. Animals received tacrolimus for 15 days and accessed for rejection, GVHD and for chimerism analysis. RESULTS: High mortality due to GVHD was observed in G2, 3, and 4, and correlated with high levels of donor T cells in recipients blood. G0 and G1 showed early acute rejection with progression toward chronic rejection, in contrast to the preconditioned groups. High and low doses of total body irradiation resulted in allogeneic and in a mixed chimerism, respectively. Decrease in donor chimeric cells after 11 weeks in preconditioned groups was correlated with severe allograft rejection. CONCLUSION: Donor preconditioning with 250 rd and or ALS combined with recipient preconditioning and donor-specific bone marrow infusions prevented GVHD and resulted in a transient mixed chimerism with inhibition of allograft rejection after small bowel transplantation.",M1
11301194,"Combined host-conditioning with CTLA4-Ig, tacrolimus, anti-lymphocyte serum, and low-dose radiation leads to stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism.The toxic dose of irradiation required to achieve stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism is the major limitation to its clinical application in transplantation and other nonmalignant conditions such as hemoglobinopathies. This study examines the additive effect of costimulatory blockage, to our previously described tacrolimus-based conditioning regimen, in further reducing the dose of total-body irradiation to achieve stable mixed chimerism in rats. Fully mismatched, 4- to 6-week-old ACI and Wistar Furth rats were used as donors and recipients, respectively. Recipients were administered CTLA4-Ig 2mg/kg/day (alternate days) in combination with tacrolimus 1 mg/kg/day (daily) from day 0 through day +10, anti-lymphocyte serum 10 mg at day +10 (single dose), and total-body irradiation ranging from 100-600 cGy, prior to bone marrow transplantation (day 0) with 100 x 10(6) of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells. Levels of donor chimerism were determined over a period of 12 months. The short course of CTLA4-Ig, tacrolimus, and <e>ALS</e> led to dramatic engraftments at reduced doses of irradiation: 100% (5/5) and 93% (13/14) of the animals developed mixed chimerism at 400 cGy and 300 cGy, respectively. At 300 cGy, recipients exhibited durable, multilineage mixed chimerism at 365 days with donor cells ranging from 19-42% (mean 23.4%) with no evidence of graft-vs-host disease. These mixed chimeras exhibited in vitro (mixed lymphocyte reaction) and in vivo (skin grafts) donor-specific tolerance. This study suggests that addition of costimulatory blockade to a tacrolimus-based conditioning regimen reduces the dose of irradiation required to achieve stable multilineage chimerism in rats.",M1
10752754,"Role of transplant induction therapy on recurrence rate of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.Individuals with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are at risk for recurrence of disease following renal transplantation. The rate of recurrence has been estimated to range from 20% to 30%. The factors associated with an increased probability of recurrence are not known, although the rapidity of progression of disease, age at onset, and the presence of diffuse mesangial proliferation in the native kidney have all been implicated. We analyzed the data from 35 patients with FSGS who received 37 renal transplants at this institution between October 1968 and December 1997. Recurrence was diagnosed by the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria and a transplant biopsy compatible with the diagnosis. Sixteen recurrences were noted, with an overall recurrence rate of 43%. The risk of recurrence was associated with the use of antilymphocytic serum (<e>ALS</e>) for initial induction therapy; being 11% in those who received no induction therapy versus 53% in those who received ALS. Furthermore, in the latter group, the rate of recurrence was 88% in those who received antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM) versus 40% in those who received Minnesota antilymphocytic globulin. Factors such as race, sex, age at time of diagnosis, rapidity of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), response to alkylating agents and/or cyclosporin therapy prior to ESRD, age at time of transplant, donor source, and triple or double immunosuppressive therapy did not appear to have an effect on the rate of recurrence. We conclude that induction therapy with ALS at time of transplantation increases the risk of recurrence of FSGS following renal transplantation.",M1
11045634,"Donor T cells are not required for induction of allograft tolerance in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum, rapamycin, and donor bone marrow cells.BACKGROUND: Postgraft infusion of donor bone marrow cells (BMC) effectively induces tolerance to skin allografts in antilymphocyte serum- and rapamycin-treated recipients in fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched mouse strain combinations. We used various gene knockout mice to examine the role of donor T cells and B cells in BMC-induced allograft tolerance. METHODS: All recipient mice received <e>ALS</e> on days -1 and 2 and rapamycin (6 mg/kg) on day 7 relative to fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched skin grafting on day 0. Donor BMC prepared either from mice lacking CD4- and/or CD8a-, or CD3epsilon-expressing cells or B cells, or from corresponding wildtype mice, were given on day 7. The level and phenotypes of chimerism was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: All T cell- and B cell-deficient BMC were as effective as wild-type BMC in inducing prolongation of skin graft survival. A low degree of chimerism without donor type T cells was detected in tolerant mice given T cell-deficient BMC or wild-type BMC 60 days after transplantation. Chimeric cells were composed of B cells and macrophages/monocytes. Low level chimerism without donor T or B cells was also present in tolerant mice given B cell-deficient BMC. CONCLUSION: Donor type T cells and T cell chimerism are not required for induction of allograft tolerance by the antilymphocyte serum/rapamycin/donor BMC-infusion protocol. Donor B cells also do not participate in tolerance induction. Thus, infusion of T cell-depleted BMC in conjunction with conventional immunosuppressive regimens will be a simple, safe, and effective way to induce allograft tolerance in clinical organ transplantation.",M1
10423320,"Skin allograft survival following intrathymic injection of donor bone marrow.BACKGROUND: Success has been reported using intrathymic injection in the preconditioning regimen to induce allograft tolerance. Although long-term stable tolerance has been achieved in numerous rodent vascularized solid organ allograft models, tolerance to skin transplants has only been achieved across minor antigenic or concordant species disparities. This study sought to induce tolerance across an allogeneic barrier in a rat model with a major genetic disparity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lewis rats were injected intrathymically with 1 x 10(8) Brown-Norway (BN) bone marrow cells and intraperitoneally with 1.0 cc of rabbit anti-rat anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). Twenty-one days later, BN skin grafts were placed on the injected animals. Control groups were included to isolate the effect of technique, thymic manipulation, strain specificity, and ALS. RESULTS: Animals receiving both intrathymic bone marrow cells and ALS had a skin graft median survival time of 24 days versus 8 days for the control group (P = 0.003). Groups receiving anti-lymphocyte serum alone or intrathymic bone marrow cell injection alone exhibited no skin graft survival prolongation. Mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed normal responsiveness of tolerant animal lymphocytes to donor strain lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: This protocol utilizing the intrathymic injection of donor bone marrow cells along with short-term immunosuppression with anti-lymphocyte serum produced markedly prolonged survival of skin allografts transplanted across a major histocompatibility barrier. Although tolerance was incomplete, significant prolongation has not previously been reported in genetic disparities of this degree. These results suggest that the application of this technique for central immune modulation may be beneficial for allograft tolerance induction and deserves further study in large animals models.",M1

9810502,"The effect of thymic inoculation to induce tolerance of allogeneic thyroid grafts in the outbred rabbit.Many studies have demonstrated that allograft tolerance can be achieved in inbred rats and mice following intrathymic injection of donor cells or antigen and treatment with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). In outbred dogs, xenografts, and inbred rat strains with major MHC antigen difference, tolerance has not similarly been induced. The focus of this study was to determine whether allogeneic thyroid graft tolerance could be achieved in outbred rabbits. In the experimental group (n = 5), recipients received an intrathymic injection of donor lymphocytes and a single treatment of ALS. Controls (n = 5) received intrathymic cell culture medium and ALS treatment. Donor-recipient allogenicity was monitored with mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) over 18 weeks. Donor thyroid tissue was placed into recipient gluteal muscle fibres one week following the last MLC measurement. A third group of rabbits (n = 4) received thyroid autografts without any other treatment. There were no differences in MLC stimulation indices (SI) between the control and experimental group nor did MLC (SI) change within groups. All thyroid autografts survived the two week monitoring period and demonstrated normal appearing thyroid follicles on histologic examination. All thyroid allografts showed severe acute rejection reactions on biopsy within one week. Further studies using outbred animals to examine the role of thymic inoculation are required to determine whether similar techniques might be successful in the human.",M1

9728927,"A partial conditioning strategy for achieving mixed chimerism in the rat: tacrolimus and anti-lymphocyte serum substantially reduce the minimum radiation dose for engraftment.Development of partial conditioning strategies to achieve reliable engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow with minimum recipient morbidity could extend the therapeutic application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to enzyme deficiency states, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune diseases, and the induction of tolerance for solid organ and cellular allografts. In this study we describe a nonmyeloablative rat BMT model and examine the effect of clinically available immunosuppressants on the minimum amount of total body irradiation (TBI) required for allogeneic engraftment. Donor ACI marrow was depleted of T cells using immunomagnetic beads and transplanted to major histocompatibility complex- and minor antigen-mismatched Wistar Furth (WF) rats (ACI --&gt; WF) conditioned with varying doses of TBI. Recipients conditioned with TBI alone required myeloablation with 1000 cGy for reliable allogeneic marrow engraftment. Administration to WF recipients of a single dose of anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) 5 days prior to BMT together with a limited course of tacrolimus (1 mg/kg/day) resulted in engraftment of ACI bone marrow at only 500 cGy TBI. ACI --&gt; WF recipients were stable mixed chimeras (mean donor chimerism 49% at 330 days post-BMT). Chimerism was multilineage. All recipient animals were free of graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that a nonmyeloablative conditioning strategy based on low-dose TBI and a limited course of tacrolimus plus ALS can produce long-term mixed multilineage chimerism.",M1

9583862,"Indefinite survival of skin allografts in adult thymectomized, antilymphocyte serum-treated mice given bone marrow and thymus grafts of donor origin: tolerance induction by donor bone marrow and thymus.BACKGROUND: Perigraft immunosuppression with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and postgraft infusion of donor bone marrow cells (BMC), which induces allograft unresponsiveness in a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate mouse combination, is much less effective in class I and II MHC-disparate strain combinations. Because the thymus plays a central role in the maturation, differentiation, and education of T lymphocytes, which are the principal mediator of allograft responses, we examined whether transplantation of donor-specific thymus combined with adult thymectomy of recipients enhances the tolerogenic effect of ALS and donor BMC infusion in a strongly histoincompatible class I and II MHC-disparate DBA/2-to-B6AF1 mouse strain combination. METHODS: Adult thymectomy was performed 4 weeks before grafting. B6AF1 mice received ALS (days -1 and 2), skin allografts (day 0), and BMC and/or thymus grafts (ThyTx) (day 7). Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect donor cells in tolerant mice. Limiting dilution assay was used to calculate the frequencies of precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes against donor and third-party alloantigens. The presence of suppressor cells was determined by in vivo adoptive transfer assay and in vitro coculture mixed lymphocyte culture. RESULTS: When adult thymectomy and postgraft donor ThyTx were combined with ALS and donor BMC, DBA/2 allograft survival was prolonged with all grafts surviving for &gt;122 days. Third-party (DBA/1) or recipient ThyTx was not effective. The tolerant mice accepted the second donor skin allografts but acutely rejected the third-party grafts. No significant chimerism was detected. Marked reduction of precursor cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies continued only against donor alloantigens after second donor and third-party skin grafting. No suppressor cell activity was detected. Immunopathological analysis revealed that the cells in the ThyTx of tolerant mice are of donor origin. CONCLUSION: Donor ThyTx combined with donor BMC infusion in adult thymectomized, ALS-treated mice induced clonal deletion of donor-reactive T cells.",M1
9521210,"Importance of natural killer cells in the rejection of hamster skin xenografts.BACKGROUND: In the hamster to rat xenogeneic combination, antibodies, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells have all been implicated in the process of rejection. 3.2.3 is a mouse IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against NKR-P1A on rat NK cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of this mAb independently and in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in a hamster to rat skin graft model in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved in xenograft rejection. METHODS: Lewis rats were recipients of hamster skin grafts. Various groups received antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) (days -1, 0, and +2), rapamycin (3 mg/kg; alternate days from day +1 through day +13), and 3.2.3 mAb (days 0, +1, and +2). Anti-hamster antibody production was determined serially with a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Lewis anti-hamster mixed lymphocyte reaction and cell-mediated lympholysis assays were performed within 7 days after rejection of the skin graft. NK cell function was tested using a cytotoxicity assay versus YAC-1 target cells on day 14 or day 15 after skin grafting. RESULTS: Median graft survival in untreated animals was 7 days. There was only modest prolongation in rats treated with rapamycin alone (median survival time [MST]=9 days) or ALS alone (MST=10 days). The use of 3.2.3 mAb in untreated rats (3.2.3 alone MST=7 days) and in ALS-treated rats (ALS+3.2.3 MST=9.5 days) did not improve graft survival. The combination of ALS+rapamycin substantially improved graft survival (MST=13 days), and even greater prolongation was seen with the addition of 3.2.3 mAb (ALS+rapamycin+3.2.3 MST=18.5 days). Cytotoxic antibodies, secondary mixed lymphocyte reaction responses, cytotoxic T cells, and normal NK activity were seen at the time of rejection in untreated rats as well as those treated with 3.2.3 mAb alone, ALS alone, ALS+3.2.3 mAb, and rapamycin alone. ALS+rapamycin completely blocked the formation of anti-hamster antibodies and cytotoxic T cells but did not suppress NK activity. The use of 3.2.3 mAb produced a marked but transient suppression of NK activity in all groups. CONCLUSION: Hamster skin xenografts can be rejected by Lewis rats in the absence of cytotoxic antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. ALS, rapamycin, and ALS+rapamycin do not suppress NK activity in Lewis rats, although their use produces a modest prolongation of hamster skin graft survival. The administration of 3.2.3 mAb to Lewis rats results in a marked but transient suppression of NK cell function, which substantially prolongs hamster skin graft survival only when antibody and cytotoxic T-cell production have also been suppressed.",M1
9500619,"Determination of an improved sirolimus (rapamycin)-based regimen for induction of allograft tolerance in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum and donor-specific bone marrow.BACKGROUND: Posttransplant donor-specific bone marrow (BM) infusion in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) induces specific unresponsiveness (tolerance) to skin allografts, which can be augmented by the adjuvant administration of chemotherapeutic immunosuppressive agents. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal dose and timing of administration of sirolimus (rapamycin) to induce maximal skin allograft survival in ALS-treated, BM-infused recipients. METHODS: DBA/2 donor skin grafts were placed on B6AF1 recipients (class I- and II-disparate). Groups of recipient mice (n=10 each) received combinations of the following treatment protocols: ALS, 0.5 ml on days -1 and 2; BM, 25x10(6) donor-specific cells on day 7; sirolimus, 6, 12, 18, or 24 mg/kg at times indicated; and cyclosporine, 50 mg/kg at times indicated. The immune status of putatively tolerant animals was examined with mixed lymphocyte cultures, cell-mediated lympholysis assays (CML), and limiting dilution analyses. RESULTS: When administered in conjunction with ALS/BM, a single dose of sirolimus (6 mg/kg) on days 21, 18, 14, 10, or 7 resulted in median skin graft survival times of 35, 26, 40, 46, and 103 days, respectively, versus a median survival of 27 days in mice given ALS and BM alone. The addition of cyclosporine to sirolimus (6 mg/kg) given on day 7 or days 7 and 10 did not significantly increase graft survival over that achieved with sirolimus alone. A single dose (18 or 24 mg/kg) of sirolimus administered on day 7 to ALS/BM-treated recipients resulted in 100% 200-day skin graft acceptance. Tolerant mice demonstrated nonspecific suppression of the mixed lymphocyte culture assays at 90 and 200 days and a nonspecific reduction of the CML assay at 50 days. By 200 days, the third-party CML response was restored, whereas donor-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity remained suppressed. There was a donor-specific reduction in the number of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones by limiting dilution assay at 120 days. In vivo specificity of immunosuppression induced with this protocol was demonstrated by indefinite survival of second donor-specific skin grafts placed on putatively tolerant mice at day 90, whereas third-party skin grafts were rejected in 14 days. CONCLUSION: A single dose of sirolimus (18-24 mg/kg) administered on day 7, within the context of an ALS/BM immunosuppressive regimen, reliably induces permanent skin allograft acceptance in this model. In vitro measures of immunocompetence demonstrated an early nonspecific suppression of the recipients immune status and later recovery of third-party immunoreactivity. In vivo testing indicates an operationally tolerant state that is donor-specific 90 days after treatment.",M1
9326417,"Use of CTLA4-Ig in combination with conventional immunosuppressive agents to prolong allograft survival.BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to determine the effectiveness of CTLA4-Ig, a novel immunosuppressive agent, in augmenting allograft survival when combined with either cyclosporine, sirolimus, donor-specific bone marrow alone (BM), or bone marrow in conjunction with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). METHODS: Full-thickness skin allografts were used in C3H to B6AF1 (class I mismatch) and AKR to C57BL/6 (complete mismatch) models. Groups of mice (n=6-14) were treated with various combinations of the following treatment protocols: murine CTLA4-Ig, L-6 control Ig, sirolimus, cyclosporine, ALS, or ALS/BM. RESULTS: In the class I mismatch model, L-6 control Ig had no effect whereas use of CTLA4-Ig alone resulted in a doubling of the median graft survival compared with controls. The addition of either sirolimus or cyclosporine to CTLA4-Ig increased graft survival over that achieved with CTLA4-Ig alone. CTLA4-Ig demonstrated no efficacy when used in combination with BM, ALS, or ALS/BM. CTLA4-Ig was clearly less effective in the complete mismatch model. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CTLA4-Ig may be effective clinically in combination with cyclosporine or sirolimus but offers no additional effectiveness in combination with antilymphocyte serum with or without donor-specific bone marrow.",M1
9311715,"Donor-specific tolerance by perioperative intrathymic injection of bone marrow cells in the rat cardiac allograft model: use of FK506 can shorten the necessary duration of pretransplant intrathymic conditioning.BACKGROUND: Many strategies of tolerance induction by intrathymic (IT) injection of donor alloantigens have been reported to date; however, the timing of IT injection is usually 1-3 weeks before transplantation. METHODS: To apply IT injection to cadaveric organ transplantation, 1 x 10(8) fully allogeneic bone marrow cells (BMC) of Buffalo (BUF; RT1b) rats were intrathymically injected into Wistar Furth (WF; RT1u) rats at the time of BUF cardiac allografting with short-course therapy of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and FK506 in our experimental model. RESULTS: Allogeneic IT injection of BUF BMC with ALS and FK506 indefinitely prolonged graft survival (mean survival time &gt; 210 days) in all WF rats. On day 130 after grafting, tolerant WF rats accepted donor BUF skin grafts (&gt; 120 days) but not third-party Lewis skin grafts. In control groups, syngeneic IT injection of WF BMC or intravenous injection of donor BUF BMC in combination with ALS/FK506 therapy failed to induce tolerance. In vivo testing was performed during induction (1 month) or during maintenance (6 months of tolerance. In the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), spleen T cells of tolerant rats at 1 month after grafting displayed hyporesponsiveness after stimulation with donor cells. The addition of interleukin (IL)-2 to MLR culture did not restore T-cell responsiveness. Tolerant rats had a significantly decreased frequency of T cytotoxic cell precursors (fTcp) of 1:4,926, and frequency of IL-2-producing T helper cell precursors (fThp) of 1:23,925, compared with naive rats (1: 2,158 and 1:4,266, respectively). By 6 months after grafting, however, the anti-donor MLR proliferative responses of tolerant rats had been restored to the levels of naive splenic T cells. These tolerant rats displayed restoration of the (fTcp) of 1:2,842 and of the (fThp) of 1:5,630, which were comparable frequencies of naive rats. Suppressor T cells did not contribute in this model. In cardiac grafts of tolerant rats induced by IT injection, expression of both Th1 (interferon-gamma and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines was detected in the early phase; thereafter, expression was completely inhibited, except for interferon-gamma in the chronic phase. CONCLUSIONS: Perfect donor-specific tolerance was obtained by IT injection of donor BMC at the time of transplantation, while alloimmune responses were maintained at levels similar to those of naive rats.",M1
9333422,"[Control of autoimmune processes by natural and other non-harmful methods]At present an increase of some autoaggressive diseases can be observed. The commonly used treatment consists of the administration of some immunosuppressive drug of some hormonal preparations. This type of therapy is accompanied by some undesired side effects, as these drugs influence also some other cell systems besides the immunologically active cells. These drugs are also known to lower the resistance to some intercurrent infections. Due to these undesired side effects some naturally occurring factors are introduced into the therapy. These are e.g., TGF-beta, or some interleukins (IL-10 etc.). In our department and immunosuppressively acting substance was isolated from DHL which had the ability to inhibit the AA (adjuvant arthritis) in rats. In humans this SF (suppressive factor) stimulates the CD 8+ cells which are known to have suppressoric activity. This SF was successfully applied in some autoaggressive diseases, e.g., atopic eczema, multiple sclerosis, some polyradiculoenuritis, amyotropic lateral sclerosis etc. In this paper the results in the <e>ALS</e> patients are given. Amongst other possibilities of the therapy the application of antilymphocyte sera, monoclonal antibodies to some CD markers of lymphocytes and some methods of hyposensitizations of tolerance induction are mentioned.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of sirolimus versus cyclosporine in augmenting the unresponsiveness induced by an antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>)/donor-specific bone marrow (BM)-based regimen across three levels of histoincompatibility: class I and II disparate (DBA/2 to B6AF1), complete mismatch (AKR to C57BL/6), and xenograft (ACI rat to B6AF1). METHODS: Full-thickness skin grafts were taken from donors and placed on recipients in standard fashion. Seven groups of recipient mice (n=10-28) received various combinations of the following treatment protocols: sirolimus, 1.5 mg/kg (3.0 mg/kg for xenografts) every other day from day 0 to day 12; cyclosporine, 50 mg/kg every other day from day 10 through 22; ALS, 0.5 ml on days -1 and 2 for allografts and days -1, 2, and 4 for xenografts; and BM, 25 million donor-specific cells IV on day 7. RESULTS: The administration of ALS or ALS/BM resulted in modest but significant prolongation of skin graft survival in all combinations tested. Cyclosporine combined with ALS or ALS/BM significantly extended allograft survival compared with ALS or ALS/BM alone (P&lt;0.05) but had no effect on xenograft survival. In contrast, the combination of sirolimus with ALS or ALS/BM resulted in a two- to threefold increase in allograft survival and over a fourfold increase in xenograft survival when compared with the comparable cyclosporine-based regimen. Additionally, lymphocytes isolated from class I and II incompatible mice with skin grafts surviving &gt;100 days demonstrated markedly reduced interleukin 2 and interferon-gamma secretion in response to irradiated donor-specific lymphocytes in culture. CONCLUSIONS: In the regimens tested, sirolimus was superior to cyclosporine in augmenting donor BM-induced skin graft prolongation in ALS-treated mice across all levels of histoincompatibility.",M1

A unidirectional GVHD model was used in which intravenous injection of 3-4 x 10(8) Lewis rat (donor) lymphocytes into (Lewis x Brown Norway)F1 rats (recipients) causes lethal GVHD. The donor animals were divided into five treatment groups. The group 1 donor animals received no treatment. The group 2 donors received a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of antilymphocyte antiserum (<e>ALS</e>). The group 3 donors received an intrathymic injection of 50x10(6) host splenocytes. The group 4 donors received both ALS (intraperitoneally) and intrathymic allograft. The group 5 donors received both ALS (intraperitoneally) and intravenous allograft. Two weeks after these treatments, 3-4x10(8) lymphocytes from each of these donors were injected (intravenously) into the recipients. The clinical signs of GVHD, as measured by profound weight loss, hair loss, inflammation of foot pads and ears, and profound splenomegaly, were evident in recipients of groups 1, 2, and 3 between days 9 and 10 and in the recipients (two of four) of group 5 on day 17. No GVHD was observed by histopathology in all 14 hosts that received lymphocyte injection from the group 4 donor animals (up to 300 days). These results demonstrate that GVHD can be eliminated by tolerizing donors toward host by intrathymic injection of the recipient-type lymphocytes into the donor. A single injection of ALS is necessary to possibly eliminate antihost response from the donor for the tolerance induction. The thymic route appears to be superior to the intravenous route for tolerance induction.",M1

8843586,"Late adjunctive therapy with single doses of rapamycin in skin-allografted mice treated with antilymphocyte serum and donor bone marrow cells.Temporary donor-specific unresponsiveness induced by treatment of skin allografted mice with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and donor bone marrow cells (BMC) can be converted to long-term graft survival and tolerance by adding adjunctive immunosuppressive agents, including rapamycin (Rapa). Rapa was given in a suboptimal dosing schedule to probe several aspects of its use in the promotion of tolerization. Single doses were given at 2 weeks post-transplantation to recipients prepared with ALS and donor BMC. Graft survival was markedly prolonged in a dose-dependent fashion by day +14, Rapa doses ranging from 0.75 to 6.0 mg/kg. Indefinite (&gt; 300 day) graft survival was observed in 26% of recipients given the highest Rapa dose. Short-term treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA) or deoxyspergualin (DSG) was ineffective when injected at this time. Rapa augmented the tolerizing effect of grafting with skin from newborn mice but had no significant additive or synergistic effects with the short course of CsA or with DSG given on days +1 to +3, even though the latter prolonged graft survival when added to the ALS/BMC protocol. Single doses of Rapa on day +1 also prolonged graft survival, but without any of the grafts surviving indefinitely. Later dosing on day +28 resulted in &gt; 70% of grafts surviving &gt; 300 days. Challenge grafting of these mice after day +300 resulted in delayed rejection of donor strain, but not third-party skin grafts. Rapa was very effective when given as widely spaced doses on days +14 and +49. Also, grafts showing the earliest signs of rejection could be rescued with a single Rapa dose in recipients treated with ALS and BMC but not ALS alone. Transfer of prolonged graft survival with spleen cells from ALS plus BMC treated recipients was not adversely affected by Rapa given to the suppressor-like spleen cell donors approximately 1 week before cell harvest. We conclude that the use of Rapa as an adjunctive agent in allograft recipients treated with ALS plus donor BMC is very flexible in terms of timing of administration, and that the drug can be effectively given as widely spaced doses or as a rescue agent after ALS/BMC treatment. Additionally, an active immunoregulatory mechanism induced by ALS/BMC treatment appears to be spared by Rapa.",M1
8661178,"Cardia allograft unresponsiveness using a posttransplant strategy : characterization of the graft infiltrate.We evaluated a combined posttransplant strategy using antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) at time of engraftment followed by low dose total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and donor bone marrow cell (BMC) inoculation administered either intrathymically (IT) or intravenously (IV) in the vigorously rejecting strain combination DA into Lew recipients. Allograft survival was significantly prolonged with administration of ALS in combination with TLI and IT (105 +/- 28.6 days) or IV (106.8 +/- 28.6 days) BMC compared to administration of ALS combined with either TLI (17.8 +/- 0.4 days) or BMC (9.0 +/- 0.0 days), or TLI combined with BMC (1 1.5 +/- 0.5 days) (P &lt; 0.000 1, experimental vs control animals). There was no difference in survival between those animals who underwent IT or IV BMC inoculation. Third-party (WF) BMC inoculation did not significantly prolong allograft survival (10.0 +/- 1.0 days). A mild to moderate cellular infiltrate was present in allograft tissue after 100 days. To further characterize these cells, cytokine mRNA expression in allograft tissue (&gt; 100 days posttransplant) was evaluated using nonisotopic in situ hybridization. A similar cytokine profile was demonstrated in allograft tissue compared to naive and isograft tissue, except for a slight increase in IL-2 (P &lt; 0.02, control vs IV BMC; P = NS, other groups). In summary, unresponsiveness was induced in a high-responder strain combination using a combined posttransplant strategy of ALS, TLI, and donor antigen either IT or IV. The cytokine profile of the graft infiltrating cells was similar to that of normal tissue. Unresponsiveness may be the result of functional inactivation of these cells.",M1
8661177,"Tolerance to cardiac allografts requires a time lag between intrathymic treatment and transplantation.Permanent tolerance to an experimental heterotopic cardiac allograft can be achieved by pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) and intrathymic inoculation of donor cells. Most successful experimental protocols have employed a time lag of 2 to 3 weeks between intrathymic pretreatment and transplantation, which makes this treatment strategy impractical for clinical heart transplantation. In these experiments we modified the standard protocol by giving ALS 24 hr prior to both intrathymic injection of donor cells and heterotopic transplantation. Seven Lewis rats had intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of ALS and 24 hr later underwent intrathymic injection of 5 X 10(7) donor Lewis-Brown Norway (LBN) splenocytes and heterotopic cardiac transplantation using an LBN donor. Mean graft survival was 24.4 days, significantly longer than the 7.8-day graft survival observed in untreated Lewis recipients (n = 5) (P &lt; 0.02). However, graft survival was not different from that observed in Lewis rats pretreated with ALS alone (n = 5) (25.8 days, P = NS). Permanent graft survival was produced in two rats receiving only A-LS and in one rat receiving both ALS and intrathymic inoculation. In these experiments it appears that prolongation of graft survival may have been due to the effect of A-LS alone. These results suggest that there is a critical time period between intrathymic inoculation and transplantation that is needed for permanent tolerance to be induced consistently. This may be due to the kinetics of the effects of ALS on alloreactive T-lymphocytes or to a time-dependent requirement for antigen processing in the thymus.",M1
8689035,"Immunomodulation with intrathymic grafts or anti-lymphocyte serum promotes long-term intraspinal allograft survival.In this study, we sought to test whether introduction of fetal cells into the adult rat thymus would promote immunotolerance to subsequent donor-type allografts in the injured spinal cord. To first evaluate intrathymic survival of fetal central nervous system (CNS) tissue, fragments of E14 Sprague-Dawley (SD) fetal spinal cord (FSCSD) were injected into the thymuses of either adult, outbred SD, or Wistar rats. Histological examination revealed well-differentiated grafts in both the SD (10 out of 13) and Wistar (7 out of 13) recipients. We next examined whether prior intrathymic exposure to FSC graft-derived alloantigens leads to enhanced survival of subsequent allografts into the injured, adult spinal cord. Wistar rats thus first received FSCSD tissue as intrathymic grafts coupled with single-dose, anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) ablation of the circulating host T-cell population. Ten days later, FCSSD was transplanted into an aspiration lesion of each intrathymic graft recipient's spinal cord. After 60 days, 87% of two-stage graft recipients (n = 15) exhibited viable intraspinal (IS) grafts compared to 38% (3 out of 8) observed in the controls (i.e., not receiving intrathymic grafts). Another group of Wistar rats that had received ALS (only) at the time of the IS FSCSD transplant (n = 8) also had 75% graft survival rates after 60 days. These initial findings show that the intrathymic microenvironment can be a compatible ectopic site for fetal SC graft development and survival. Also, the enhanced survival of intraspinal grafts in animals with previous intrathymic implants or ALS administered at the time of grafting suggests the potential for inducing immunoprotection of some fetal neural allografts in adult recipients.",M1
8959868,"Induction of specific inhibition of alloreactivity in beagle dogs by intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes.The aim of this study was to investigate whether intrathymic injection (ITI) of donor splenocytes in dogs might lead to specific immunomodulation as assessed by mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) tests. Two groups of five beagles each were used. Group 1 contained animals that were 2 years old, group 2 consisted of animals that were 6 months old. One animal was splenectomized per experimental group and 1 x 10(9) splenocytes were injected into the thymic lobes or thymic remnant of the four remaining dogs. On the day of ITI the dogs were treated subcutaneously with a single dose of 2 ml/kg antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). In group 1 the thymus of all dogs was found to be atrophic. ITI in this group did not result in a decreased immunoreactivity but rather in an enhanced immune response. In group 2 the thymus was still clearly present and ITI was easy to perform. ITI induced a significant reduction of specific MLC reactivity at 1 week after treatment. The effect was transient and not significantly further diminished at week 2. These results indicate that ITI is a technically feasible procedure in a preclinical animal model. It may induce temporary sensitization as well as immunosuppression, possibly depending on the age of the recipient.",M1
8592437,"Mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression in rat pancreas allotransplantation.Prolongation of pancreas allograft survival has been difficult to achieve in rodent models despite use of immunosuppression regimens that successfully increase graft survival of other organs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new immunosuppressive agent, mycophenolate mofetil (MM), for its ability to prevent rejection in a rat pancreas transplant model. In addition, using congenic strains of rats, the efficacy of MM in rat pancreas transplantation was treated in the context of isolated class I or class II major histocompatibility (MHC) differences. MM in doses of 12.5 to 37 mg/kg significantly prolonged BUF to LEW heart transplant survival beyond a 14-day course of therapy thereby demonstrating its immunosuppressive efficacy. In similar pancreas transplant experiments, however, most grafts were rejected during the period of MM administration. Combination therapy with MM and cyclosporine did not extend pancreas survival beyond that achieved with MM alone (Mean Survival Time of 13.8 +/- 2.7 vs 11.7 +/- 1.6 days, respectively). Conversely, combined therapy with MM and antilymphocyte serum achieved a mean survival for BUF to LEW pancreas transplants of 52.3 +/- 24.8 days, which was significantly longer than that observed for either MM (11.7 +/- 1.6) or <e>ALS</e> (18.0 +/- 7.6) alone. MM therapy doubled pancreas allograft survival when used in the face of class I MHC disparity and compared to controls (19.5 +/- 1.0 vs 10.0 +/- 1.9 days) but did not prolong grafts that were disparate at only the class II locus (12.6 +/- 1.5 vs 12.0 +/- 1.2 days, respectively, for MM vs control). These data indicate that MM may not be an effective single agent immunosuppressive for pancreas transplantation except when MHC disparity is limited to the class I locus.",M1
8525533,"Effect of rapamycin on renal allograft survival in canine recipients treated with antilymphocyte serum, donor bone marrow, and cyclosporine.Rapamycin (Rapa) monotherapy can promote renal allograft survival in dogs, but it is very toxic. To attempt to augment the effectiveness of Rapa and reduce its toxicity in a tolerance induction protocol, canine renal allograft recipients were treated briefly with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), donor bone marrow cells (BMC), and a limited course of cyclosporine (CsA). Rapa had little effect when CsA-treated recipients were given ALS on days -5 to -1 and BMC on day +1. When combined with CsA given days +13 to +42, ALS on days -5 to +7, and BMC on day +10, Rapa at 0.3 mg/kg on day +8 plus alternate days +15 to +39 significantly increased overall survival and was compatible with long-term survival after immunosuppression (6 grafts, 1 graft &gt; 212 days, 1 graft &gt; 470 days).

8525521,"Induction of tolerance to skin allografts by intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes. Effect of donor-recipient strain combination and supplemental rapamycin.The effect of donor-recipient strain combination and supplemental rapamycin (Rapa) on tolerance induction by intrathymic (IT) injection of donor splenocytes was examined in a mouse skin allograft model. In an MHC class I-mismatched C3H/He skin to (C57BL/6 x A)F1 (B6AF1) mouse combination, IT injection of 50 x 10(6) donor splenocytes with transient immunosuppression by rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) induced significant prolongation of skin allograft survival with a median survival time (MST) of 115 days versus an MST of 24.5 days in controls given ALS alone. With an additional short course of supplemental Rapa treatment at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg i.p. every other day from day 0 to 12, all C3H/He skin allografts survived indefinitely (&gt; 350 days) in ALS-treated, donor splenocyte intrathymically injected B6AF1 recipient mice. Tolerance was antigen-specific, since the second donor-type skin allografts were accepted while third-party skin allografts were acutely rejected in these mice bearing long-term C3H/He skin allografts. In MHC class I- and II-disparate (DBA/2 to B6AF1) and fully MHC-incompatible (AKR to B6) strain combinations, IT injection of donor splenocytes and ALS treatment failed to prolong skin allograft survival over ALS controls. When supplemental Rapa was used, long-term skin allograft acceptance was observed with an MST of 127 days for the DBA/2 to B6AF1 combination and 70 days for the AKR to B6 combination. In contrast, supplemental treatment with cyclosporine was not effective in these combinations, which suggests that supplemental Rapa may have a unique effect in augmenting IT tolerance induction. Thymectomy within 7 days after IT injection significantly shortened the allograft survival, which suggests that interaction of the host thymus and the injected donor splenocytes, which takes place early after IT injection, plays an important role in the induction of allograft tolerance in this model.",M1
8787463,"Suppressor cells and intrathymic inoculation of donor alloantigens in cardiac transplantation.BACKGROUND: Donor-specific tolerance to a rat heterotopic cardiac allograft has been achieved by the pretransplantation intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes and a single intraperitoneal injection of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>). Permanent tolerance is achieved without subsequent immunosuppression therapy. This study investigated the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of the tolerant state. METHODS: Tolerance was produced in Lewis rats by the administration of 1 mL of ALS intraperitoneally and 5 x 10(7) Lewis Brown Norway (LBN) splenocytes intrathymically 21 days before heterotopic transplantation using an LBN donor. RESULTS: In tolerant Lewis rats bearing LBN allografts for more than 100 days, rejection could not be produced by the intravenous injection of naive Lewis spleen cells (5 x 10(7) cells x 1 day, n = 5; 5 x 10(7) cells x 3 days, n = 5) or cells from Lewis rats sensitized to LBN tissues (5 x 10(7) cells x 3 days, n = 5). Naive Lewis recipients were pretreated with ALS and 6 days later with intravenous spleen cells (25 x 10(7), n = 5) or lymphoid cells (10 to 15 x 10(7), n = 5) from a tolerant animal bearing a viable LBN graft. When transplantation with an LBN donor was done the next day, significant prolongation of LBN allograft survival (mean survival time 32.8 days, p &lt; 0.01; and 22.2 days, p &lt; 0.01; respectively) was seen. Wistar-Furth allograft survival was not prolonged by treatment with ALS and intravenous spleen (n = 5) or lymph node (n = 5) cells from rats tolerant to LBN tissues (mean survival time 8.6 and 9.2 days, control 9 days; p = not significant). The administration of ALS alone (n = 5) did not prolong LBN graft survival (mean survival time 11.8 days). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that transferable suppressor cells specific for the donor strain are at least in part responsible for the maintenance of long-term allograft survival after intrathymic pretreatment with allogeneic cells.",M1
7604433,"Intrathymic tolerance in the Lewis-to-F344 chronic cardiac allograft rejection model.Successful induction of donor-specific unresponsiveness by intrathymic inoculation of alloantigen in several experimental acute rejection models has led us to hypothesize that similar immune manipulations can prevent chronic rejection and development of graft arteriosclerosis in the Lewis-to-F344 rat chronic cardiac allograft rejection model. Recipient F344 rats were treated with donor (Lewis) splenocytes by intrathymic injection (i.t.) alone (10 x 10(6) cells/lobe); with donor splenocytes i.t. plus a one-time dose of <e>ALS</e> (1 mg) by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.); or with ALS i.p. (1 mg) alone 2 and 6 weeks prior to heterotopic Lewis heart transplantation. Control F344 recipients received saline i.t. Allografts were monitored by daily palpation, and long-term surviving grafts were harvested on day 90 for histopathologic analysis. Control allografts had 28.6% long-term survival (&gt; 90 days) with mean graft survival of 46.7 +/- 12.2 days. At day 90 the surviving control allografts were enlarged and fibrotic with barely palpable heartbeat (mean heartbeat grade 0.29 +/- 0.18), and histologically showed diffuse moderate mononuclear cell infiltrates and advanced graft arteriosclerosis (mean vessel score 3.57 +/- 0.10 and 89 +/- 1% vessels diseased). Recipient treatment with intrathymic donor splenocytes alone significantly prolonged graft survival (89% long-term survival; mean 83.8 +/- 6.2 days, P &lt; 0.04), but did not significantly inhibit the development of graft arteriosclerosis (score 2.98 +/- 0.53 and 79 +/- 8% diseased, P = NS). By contrast, treatment with i.t. donor splenocytes plus ALS 2 weeks prior to transplantation prolonged graft survival (100% long-term; mean 90.0 +/- 0.0 days, P &lt; 0.04), and markedly inhibited graft arteriosclerosis (score 0.80 +/- 0.14, P &lt; 0.05; 27 +/- 4% diseased, P &lt; 0.05). ALS alone given two weeks prior to transplantation also prolonged graft survival (100% long-term; mean 90.0 +/- 0.0 days, P &lt; 0.04), and inhibited graft arteriosclerosis (score 0.89 +/- 0.31, P &lt; 0.05; 25 +/- 7% diseased, P &lt; 0.05). However, when ALS was given 6 weeks prior to heart transplantation the beneficial effect of ALS alone was abolished, suggesting that lymphocyte depletion may have been responsible for the observed effects when ALS was administered at 2 weeks. Interestingly, intrathymic donor splenocytes plus ALS 6 weeks prior to transplantation, on the other hand, showed significant prolongation of allograft survival (100% long-term, mean 90.0 +/- 0.0 days, P &lt; 0.04), and inhibited graft arteriosclerosis (score 0.41 +/- 0.02, P &lt; 0.05; 16 +/- 2% diseased, P &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1

ACI rat skin xenografts were transplanted to (C57BL/6 x A)F1 mice treated with rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) on days -1, +2, and +4 relative to skin grafting on day 0. Fifty million donor-type splenocytes were injected intrathymically on day 7 after transplantation. Rapa was given intraperitoneally every other day from day 0 to day 12 at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg. Prolonged skin xenograft survival was observed in ALS- and Rapa-treated recipients (no IT injection) with a median survival time of 47 days. However, skin graft survival was markedly more prolonged in the group treated with ALS, Rapa, and IT injection of donor splenocytes did not have a beneficial effect on skin xenograft survival in ALS-treated recipients. An increased presence of donor-type cells was observed in the thymus of the ALS- and Rapa-treated recipients for 7 days after IT injection of donor splenocytes. In conclusion, a short course of Rapa markedly augments rat skin xenograft survival in ALS-treated mice injected intrathymically with donor-type splenocytes.",M1

The intrathymic route of antigen presentation in this model is superior to the intravenous route in achieving unresponsiveness. To elucidate possible mechanisms involved in the induction of unresponsiveness in ALS-treated mice after intrathymic injection of donor spleen cells, we have analysed the reactivity of lymphoid cells from unresponsive mice in various ways. Deletion of donor reactive cells has been studied using the Mls antigen system. Functional inactivation was analysed by a sequential study of the frequency of donor reactive cells. Suppressor cell activity was studied using an adoptive transfer assay. Deletion of donor reactive cells was partial and occurred largely in the spleen in both early and late stages of unresponsiveness. The frequency of donor reactive cytotoxic cells was suppressed in both spleen and lymph nodes from day +/- 13 until grafts were rejected, with the exception of a rebound period at day +/- 22. In contrast, donor reactive cells were not deleted or inactivated in the thymus. Suppressor cell activity could only be detected in mice bearing long-term grafts. These results suggest that donor reactive cytotoxic cells are functionally inactivated in the spleen and nodes in the early and late stages of unresponsiveness after intrathymic injection of antigen. In contrast, donor reactive cells in the thymus do not appear to be affected.",M1

Between 1980 and 1993, 57 evaluable patients received ALS-R and prednisone +/- cyclosporine +/- androgens. Standard response criteria were used and patients were evaluated at 3 months from the start of therapy. Median age was 43 years.

Responses occurred in 16 (28%) of 57 patients. Responses were more frequent in females, in patients treated within 6 months of diagnosis, and in patients with severe disease. Among patients receiving ALS-R and cyclosporine within 2 months of diagnosis, 46% responded. After ALS-R therapy, 20 patients received ALG-H; 8 (40%) of 20 responded. Eight patients receiving ALS-R previously had received ALG-H; 2 (25%) of these 8 patients responded. Toxicity of ALS-R was minimal.

This permitted us to show the interaction of the immune system in the myoblast transplantation. The graft success was assessed by verifying signs of humoral and cellular immune reactions and the presence of dystrophin produced by the fusion of the donor myoblasts. This study showed that clones of human myoblasts were able to fuse and produce dystrophin in injected muscles of immunodeficient mice and mdx mice receiving an effective immunosuppressive treatment (i.e., ALS+CsA). However, the same pool of human myoblasts injected in mdx mice inadequately immunosuppressed (i.e., CsA alone or ALS alone) triggered an immune reaction and was rejected. Cells expressing CD4 and CD8 antigens were observed in the injected muscles of mice treated with CsA alone. Therefore, evidence of humoral and cellular rejection was observed following human myoblasts transplantation.",M1

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the distribution and the persistence of intrathymically (i.t.) injected purified antigen presenting cells (APC) over a period of time in the rat model DA-to-WAG (RT1av to RT1u) using a specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) with RT1Aa class I polymorphic specificity (R3/13 clone). Purified non-parenchymal cells (NPC) or dendritic cells (DC) were prepared from liver and spleen of DA rats with a purity of greater than 60% and 90%, respectively, shown by selected Mab staining methods. DA NPC (1 x 10(6)) or DC (5 x 10(5)) in 20 microl were injected into both lobes of the thymus of WAG rats with or without 1 ml antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) intraperitoneally. Thymus tissue was removed on days 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30, and processed for frozen sections and immunohistochemical staining with R3/13. Numerous DA-positive cells were detected in the first 3-10 days post-i.t. inoculation in both NPC- and DC-treated rats, with or without ALS. After day 10, the proportion of positive cells decreased in all cases except in rats given NPC and ALS, where similar numbers of R3/13-positive cells were seen throughout. These DA-positive cells were mostly found in the medullary portion of the thymus at the corticomedullary junction in close proximity to thymic dendritic interdigitating cells. We concluded from this pilot study that the injected cells remained in the thymus for a limited period. However, the immunosuppressive effect of ALS promoted some degree of persistence of donor APC in the thymus beyond 30 days. Further studies are in progress to reveal the specificity of these cells.",M1
11271271,"Does intrathymic injection of alloantigen-presenting cells before islet allo-transplantation prolong graft survival?Current immunosuppressive agents have potentially dangerous side-effects, are non-specific and most are also diabetogenic. We investigated tolerance induction with intrathymic injection of purified antigen-presenting cells (APC) plus a single dose of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) intraperitoneally before allogeneic islet transplantation in the rat model WAG to Lewis (RT1u to RT1l). Purified donor APC [non-parenchymal cells (NPC) or dendritic cells (DC)] were prepared from liver and spleen, respectively. Isograft function for more than 120 days proved that islet isolation, purification and transplantation procedures were adequate. A total of WAG DC (4 x 10(5)) or NPC (2 x 10(6)) in 20 microl were injected into both lobes of the thymus of 140-210 g Lewis recipients followed by a single injection of ALS. Three days later, diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). Four days later allogeneic islets were grafted into the liver by intraportal injection of 3000 WAG islets. Control animals (n = 8) received 20 microl saline intrathymically instead of APC. Graft function was assessed by blood glucose measurements with glucose levels above 15 mmol/l on 3 consecutive days defined as graft rejection. Animals given DC (n = 9) or NPC (n = 8) intrathymically plus 1 ml of ALS, rejected their grafts in an accelerated fashion with a median survival time (MST) of 3 days. However, control animals rejected their grafts with a MST of 7 days, but with two animals surviving for more than 2 months. In conclusion, intrathymic inoculation with purified APC plus a single dose of ALS did not prolong allogeneic islet graft function but induced accelerated rejection of the islet allografts.",M1
8342124,"Prevention by thymectomy of tolerance induced by intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes.BACKGROUND: We have recently demonstrated indefinite donor-specific cardiac allograft survival after the intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes and simultaneous injection of antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) in a fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched rat combination. In this study we performed thymectomy to determine the length of time required for donor alloantigen to be present in the recipient thymus to induce tolerance. METHODS: Male Buffalo (BUF; RT1b) rats at 4 to 8 weeks of age underwent intrathymic injection of 25 x 10(6) Lewis (LEW; RT1(1)) splenocytes and simultaneously received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml ALS. To determine the kinetics of tolerance induction, the BUF recipients underwent thymectomy on days 1, 3, or 7 after the initial intrathymic injection of alloantigen and intraperitoneal ALS. Twenty-one days after intrathymic alloantigen injection and ALS, all rats underwent transplantation with a heterotopic LEW cardiac allograft. RESULTS: Thymectomy performed 1 (mean survival time, 6.8 days) and 3 (mean survival time, 8.0 days) days after donor alloantigen injection and ALS did not affect the normal rejection of LEW cardiac allografts. In contrast, thymectomy 7 days after intrathymic alloantigen injection and ALS resulted in indefinite survival of cardiac allografts in 75% of recipients (mean survival time &gt; 77.0 days). In addition, allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and interleukin-2 production were markedly decreased in those recipients undergoing thymectomy after 7 days compared with untreated control rats and recipients undergoing thymectomy 1 and 3 days after alloantigen injection. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the thymus for at least 7 days after intrathymic alloantigen injection and intraperitoneal ALS allows the development of indefinite donor-specific cardiac allograft tolerance.",M1
8333035,"Allograft and xenograft unresponsiveness induced by transplantation of neonatal skin.Class I MHC-disparate skin allografts from neonatal donors survive longer than adult grafts in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>; days -1, +2) or ALS plus donor bone marrow cells (BMC; day +7 relative to grafting on day 0) or ALS, BMC, and a 2-week course of post-transplant CsA. We have now investigated whether this phenomenon extends to more strongly histoincompatible allografts (H2-KI and H2-KID mismatched) made to recipients treated with ALS, ALS plus BMC, or ALS, BMC, and CsA. Survival of neonatal grafts was longer than that of adult grafts in all experimental groups (P &lt; 0.05). In ALS/BMC/CsA-treated mice, for example, median survival of neonatal C3H grafts was 46 days, with adult grafts surviving 22 days on C57BL/6 recipients (full MHC disparity). Survival of neonatal hamster skin grafted to B6AF1 mice was not augmented beyond that for adult skin using a similar immunosuppressive protocol. But if alternate day ALS and CsA injections were begun on day -5, and ALS and CsA continued as in the allograft models, a significant xenogeneic neonatal survival advantage was demonstrated. (Donor BMC had no graft-prolonging effect in the xenograft model.) Donor BMC significantly prolonged full MHC-mismatched grafts from newborn, but not adult donors in ALS-treated recipients. Also, addition of CsA to ALS/BMC treatment prolonged the survival of neonatal, but not adult grafts mismatched at KI or KID. These results indicate that the survival advantage of neonatal grafts in immunosuppressed recipients extends to strong allogeneic incompatibilities and even to a xenograft model.",M1
8489312,"MHC class II presenting cells are necessary for the induction of intrathymic tolerance.OBJECTIVE: This study determined the form of cellular donor MHC alloantigen necessary for the induction of intrathymic tolerance. BACKGROUND: The authors have achieved indefinite donor-specific tolerance, to a fully MHC-disparate rat heterotopic cardiac allograft, after the pretransplant intrathymic injection of unfractionated donor splenocytes and a single injection of rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), without subsequent immunosuppression. METHODS: Male 4-12-week-old Buffalo (RT1b) rats underwent an intrathymic injection of either fractionated Lewis (RT1(1)) red blood cells (purified by Ficoll gradient) or T lymphocytes (purified by nylon wool column and plastic adherence), both of which express only MHC class I alloantigens, or B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (purified by plastic adherence) which express both MHC class I and class II alloantigens. At the completion of alloantigen injection the Buffalo recipient rats were given 1 ml of ALS intraperitoneally. Twenty-one days later a heterotopic Lewis heart was transplanted. RESULTS: The intrathymic injection of the fractions of Lewis MHC class I and class II expressing B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells induced a donor-specific tolerance that resulted in indefinite Lewis cardiac allograft survival (MST &gt; 125 days) in all recipients without further immunosuppression, whereas groups receiving MHC class I expressing red blood cell or T lymphocyte injections plus ALS rejected Lewis cardiac allografts with a MST of 7.3 and 16.5 days, respectively, thus indicating that the MHC class II expressing cell is necessary for the induction of intrathymic tolerance. Buffalo recipients with a long-term surviving Lewis cardiac allograft, after Lewis MHC class II expressing cells were still able to reject a third-party heterotopic ACI (RT1a) cardiac allograft in normal time (MST = 7.0 days), but did not reject a second Lewis cardiac allograft (MST &gt; 100 days). Additionally, the intrathymic injection of MHC class II expressing cells resulted in decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and an 80% decrease in in vitro donor-specific cell mediated cytotoxicity, whereas the cytolytic response to a third party was unaltered. CONCLUSION: Donor MHC class II, and not class I, expressing cells are the cells in donor splenocytes, injected intrathymically, responsible for the development of donor-specific allograft tolerance.",M1
8361174,"Prolongation of small bowel allografts after intrathymic injection of donor alloantigen and <e>ALS</e>.The increasing success of clinical small bowel transplantation in recent years has been due largely to improved nonspecific immunosuppression of the recipient, which carries significant morbidity. The induction of donor-specific tolerance would eliminate the risk of long-term immunosuppression while ensuring graft function and survival. We have demonstrated that the intrathymic injection of donor splenocytes with the simultaneous intraperitoneal administration of rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum results in indefinite donor-specific cardiac allograft survival in &gt; 85% of recipients. In this study, we further examined the effect of this tolerance induction protocol on the more immunogenic small bowel allograft. Male Buffalo (RT1b) rats were exposed to donor alloantigen by an intrathymic injection of 25 x 10(6) MHC mismatched unfractionated Lewis (RT1(1)) splenocytes. The Buffalo recipients were given 1 ml of rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum intra-peritoneally at the time of the donor antigen injection and 21 days later underwent a heterotopic 15-cm Lewis small bowel transplant. Pretransplant intrathymic Lewis alloantigen and anti-rat lymphocyte serum treatment prolonged Lewis small bowel survival by approximately 2.5 times (mean survival time = 18.0 vs 7.0 days for controls, P &lt; 0.05). These small bowel allografts demonstrated pericryptic T cell infiltrates, areas of cryptic necrosis, and a dense submucosal lymphocytic infiltrate, all consistent with acute resection. In contrast to our studies achieving donor-specific cardiac allograft survival, this protocol did not result in indefinite intestinal allograft survival. No Buffalo recipients developed evidence of graft-versus-host disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
8475563,"Induction of donor-specific tolerance to cardiac but not skin or renal allografts by intrathymic injection of splenocyte alloantigen.We have recently found that donor-specific tolerance to a cardiac allograft can be achieved after the intrathymic (i.t.) injection of donor splenocytes and a single intraperitoneal injection of rabbit antirat lymphocyte serum. The present study evaluated whether the tolerance induced by splenocytes injected i.t. could also prevent the rejection of kidney and skin allografts. Male Buffalo (RT1b) rats were given 25 x 10(6) fully MHC-mismatched unfractionated Lewis (RT1l) splenocytes by i.t. injection plus 1 ml of <e>ALS</e> i.p. and 21 days later underwent a Lewis heterotopic cardiac, orthotopic renal, or skin transplant. Lewis i.t. injection induced a donor-specific tolerance with indefinite cardiac allograft survival (&gt; 153.1 days) in 88% of the recipients without the need for further immunosuppression, while renal and skin allograft survival was prolonged (kidney 14.8 days vs. control 7.8 days; skin 11.6 days vs. control 9.2 days) but were still rejected. Buffalo recipients with a long-surviving Lewis cardiac allograft after Lewis i.t. injection were still able to reject a third-party heterotopic ACI (RT1a) cardiac allograft in normal time (7.0 days), but did not reject a second Lewis cardiac allograft (&gt; 100.0 days). In contrast, however, Buffalo recipients with long-surviving Lewis cardiac allografts did reject a Lewis skin allograft in normal time (10.0 days) and a Lewis renal allograft in a prolonged manner (17.6 days) without causing the rejection of the Lewis cardiac allografts. These data support the important role tissue-specific non-MHC antigens may play in the rejection of kidney and skin allografts.",M1
8097343,"Deletion of donor-reactive T lymphocytes in adult mice after intrathymic inoculation with lymphoid cells.Clonal deletion of self antigen-reactive T lymphocytes is known to be a dominant mechanism of tolerance induction in the normal immune system. This report considers whether deletion of antigen-reactive T cells is also the immunologic basis for the recently described model of transplantation tolerance that follows intrathymic inoculation with allogeneic lymphoid cells. We found that the outcome of injecting Mlsa- hosts with lymphocytes from Mlsa+ donors was depletion of V beta 6+ T cells (which are known to be reactive with the Mlsa superantigen). The process was found to be specific in that a similar reduction was not seen in an irrelevant T cell population (V beta 8+) in IT injected hosts. Deletion was observed in this model only if immunosuppression with <e>ALS</e> or anti-CD4 accompanied intrathymic injection. When the inoculum of allogeneic lymphocytes was administered intravenously instead of intrathymically only minimal deletion was observed. The induction of transplantation tolerance by intrathymic injection of donor lymphoid cells may prove especially efficacious since it relies on deletion of only those T cells specifically reactive to donor antigens, a process analogous to tolerance induction to self antigens.",M1

8425668,"Effect of STZ administration on islet isograft and allograft survival in NOD mice.We examined the effect of a single STZ administration on subsequent islet isograft and allograft survival in NOD mice. Young prediabetic NOD mice were rendered diabetic by STZ administration and transplanted with islet isografts 8-11 days later. The earliest loss of islet function occurred on postgraft day 49. In sharp contrast, 15 of 16 isografts in spontaneously diabetic mice were destroyed within 17 days postgrafting. A comparison of the age of islet isograft destruction in STZ-induced diabetic NOD mice with the course of diabetes development in the NOD mouse colony clearly showed that STZ administration at the prediabetic stage led to a significant delay of diabetes onset in isografts. When STZ was given to overtly diabetic NOD mice, both islet isografts and allografts survived significantly longer than those in untreated, spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. However, the degree of prolongation induced by STZ was much smaller compared with that induced by <e>ALS</e>, a potent immunosuppressive reagent. In vitro mixed lymphocyte culture experiments showed that spleen cells of mice given STZ exhibited time-dependent reduction of their alloantigen reactivities. These results demonstrate that STZ, which is commonly used to induce diabetes in various experimental animals, also possesses an immunosuppressive property, although it is relatively weak compared with ALS.",M1
8452627,"Effects of donor pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum and cyclosporin on rejection and graft-versus-host disease after small bowel transplantation in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed rats.After fully allogeneic small bowel transplantation, both graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and rejection may occur. Donor pretreatment may prevent GVHD, but this sometimes leads to accelerated graft rejection. To study a possible balance between GVHD and rejection, fully allogeneic total orthotopic small bowel transplantation was performed in rats using the WAG-to-BN donor-host combination. Untreated control grafts were rejected in 16.6 +/- 2.7 days (mean +/- SEM), and 35% of the animals had mild, transient GVHD. Pretreatment of the donor with antilymphocyte serum on days -2 and -1 before grafting, with antilymphocyte serum on days -2 and -1 before grafting, with antilymphocyte serum on days -2 and -1 before grafting, either intravenously or intraperitoneally, completely eliminated the occurrence of clinical GVHD but led to significantly shortened survival times (12.3 +/- 0.8 and 10.3 +/- 0.9 days, respectively). Donor pretreatment with 50 mg/kg cyclosporin (CyA) on days -2 and -1 prolonged graft survival significantly to 22.1 days but had no significant effect on the incidence of GVHD. Administration of 25 mg/kg CyA on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 after grafting prolonged survival to 38.3 days with no evidence of GVHD. Pretreatment of the donor with antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), combined with the same postoperative, short-term CyA regimen, increased survival to more than 50 days, again with no evidence of GVHD. When CyA was used as both donor pretreatment and postoperative therapy, there was no survival advantage compared to the use of postoperative CyA alone. These results show that an in vivo balance between GVHD and rejection exists and that abrogation of GVHD leads to accelerated rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
7521742,"Organ-specific unresponsiveness induced by intrathymic injection of donor bone marrow cells and a short course of immunosuppression in the rat heart transplantation model.Donor- and organ-specific unresponsiveness to Brown Norway (BN) heart allografts was achieved in Lewis (LEW) rats by giving intrathymic donor bone marrow cells (ITBMC) and immunosuppression at the time of transplantation. Antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) (1 ml, days 0, 2, 4) extended graft survival to a median survival time (MST) of 29.5 days (n = 6), while ALS + ITBMC extended survival to over 120 days (n = 6). FK506 (1 mg/kg, days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) too prolonged survival in the FK + ITBMC (n = 6; MST &gt; 140 days) and FK (n = 5; MST &gt; 140 days) groups. BN skin grafting provoked the rejection of long-surviving BN heart grafts in the FK group (n = 5; MST = 14 days), but did not do so in either the ALS + ITBMC (n = 2; MST &gt; 100 days) or the FK + ITBMC (n = 4; MST &gt; 93 days) groups. In the FK + ITBMC group, two of the rats which rejected BN skin grafts received a second BN heart, resulting in the graft being accepted indefinitely (&gt; 100 days) without causing the rejection of the first BN heart grafts. These facts suggest that ITBMC and concurrent T cell depletion are decisive for induction of unresponsiveness by this protocol. BN and WF (Wistar Furth) skin grafts were eventually rejected in the LEW rats which accepted BN heart grafts. Persistent allogeneic chimerism was demonstrated in the graft and recipient spleen, suggesting that chimerism may be one of the possible mechanisms of unresponsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1
1465774,"Induction of specific unresponsiveness (tolerance) to skin allografts by intrathymic donor-specific splenocyte injection in antilymphocyte serum-treated mice.Although chronic immunosuppression has been extremely successful in clinical organ transplantation, it is associated with severe complications such as opportunistic infections, spontaneous neoplasms, drug toxicities, metabolic complications, and the inability to control rejection. We therefore have investigated the ability of allogeneic donor lymphoid cells to produce specific tolerance following intrathymic (IT) injection into allograft recipients. Groups of B6AF1 mice received <e>ALS</e> on days -1 and +2 relative to C3H/He skin grafts on day 0; experimental groups received 1, 5, or 10 x 10(7) syngeneic (B6AF1) or allogeneic (C3H) spleen cells (SPCs) by IT injection on day +7. IT injection of C3H splenocytes significantly prolonged allograft survival at all cell doses tested when compared with ALS controls. The best survival was obtained following IT injection of 5 x 10(7) C3H cells (median survival time [MST] = 132 days; ALS controls = 21.5 days), with 8 of 13 skin grafts surviving longer than 100 days. IT injection of syngeneic splenocytes or third-party DBA/2 splenocytes did not prolong allograft survival beyond that observed in ALS controls. C3H spleen cells injected IT into ALS treated mice on day 0 relative to grafting of C3H skin also produced significant allograft survival (1, 5, or 10 x 10(7) SPCs = MSTs of 75, 47, and 35, respectively) but the results were inferior to those obtained by 5 x 10(7) SPCs IT on day +7. Spleen cells (1 or 5 x 10(7)) injected intraperitoneally or intravenously prolonged allograft survival beyond that seen in ALS controls but were inferior to IT injection at all doses and times studied. Bone marrow, thymocytes, or lymph node cells (5 x 10(7) cells) were substituted for SPCs for IT injection. IT injection of BM, LN or thymocytes all significantly prolonged graft survival over ALS controls. However none of these cell types was as effective as IT splenocytes. Eight B6Af1 recipients of IT splenocytes bearing C3H skin grafts for &gt; 100 days received a second C3H skin graft as well as a simultaneous third-party B10.AKM skin graft. All rejected third-party grafts in normal first-set fashion. Three tolerated both 1st and 2nd C3H grafts without any sign of rejection; 1 rejected the 2nd C3H graft while tolerating the 1st graft; and 4 rejected the 2nd C3H graft in an attenuated fashion but also rejected the 1st graft at the same pace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1
1417190,"Intrathymic injection of donor alloantigens induces donor-specific vascularized allograft tolerance without immunosuppression.The induction of donor-specific tolerance could prevent the side effects of immunosuppression while improving allograft survival. Male adult Buffalo (RT1b) rats underwent an intrathymic (IT), portal venous (PV), intrasplenic (IS), or subcutaneous (SQ) injection of 25 x 10(6) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatched Lewis (RT1(1)), UV-B-irradiated Lewis (RT1(1)), ACI (RT1a), or syngeneic Buffalo (RT1b) splenocytes. At the completion of the donor alloantigen injection, 1 mL rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) was administered intraperitoneally to the Buffalo recipients, and 21 days later a heterotopic Lewis or ACI heart was transplanted. Intrathymic injection of donor alloantigen induced a donor-specific tolerance that allowed the cardiac allograft to survive indefinitely (mean survival time [MST] &gt; 140.7 days) in 84% of the recipients without further immunosuppression, whereas groups receiving antigen injections at other sites (PV, IS, and SQ) plus ALS rejected cardiac allografts in normal fashion (MST approximately 8.0 days). Buffalo recipient rats with long-term surviving Lewis cardiac allografts after Lewis IT injection and ALS subsequently rejected a heterotopic third-party ACI cardiac allograft in normal fashion (MST approximately 7 days), whereas a second Lewis cardiac allograft was not rejected (MST &gt; 116 days). Microchimerism is unlikely because Lewis allograft survival was also prolonged (MST &gt; 38.7 days) in rats receiving UV-B-irradiated splenocytes IT, which cannot proliferate. Survival of Lewis renal allografts was also prolonged, but not indefinitely, in Buffalo recipients possessing a long-term surviving Lewis cardiac allograft (MST approximately 17.6 days versus 7 days for control). This model emphasizes the potential role of exposure of immature thymocytes to foreign donor alloantigens during maturation in the thymic environment for the development of unresponsiveness to an MHC-mismatched donor-specific vascularized allograft.",M1
1412758,"The effect of injection of donor bone marrow on the frequency of donor-reactive CTL in antilymphocyte serum-treated, grafted mice.The survival of C3H/He skin grafts can be prolonged on B6AF1 mice immunosuppressed with <e>ALS</e> by the injection of C3H/He marrow 1 week postgrafting. The precursor frequencies of donor-reactive CTL in the spleen and lymph nodes of ALS-treated, grafted mice given donor marrow were compared with CTL frequencies observed in ALS-treated, grafted controls. Spleens and nodes were removed from experimental and control mice on days +8, +14, +21, +58, and 1 year postgrafting, and used as effectors in the LDA. Donor-reactive CTL in the marrow-injected group remained suppressed as long as the recipients maintained their grafts. The frequency of CTL to third-party antigens was normal in mice bearing long-term C3H/He grafts. When marrow-injected mice rejected their grafts, the total donor-reactive CTL frequency returned to normal. In contrast, in ALS-treated controls that did not receive marrow, the total number of donor-reactive CTL returned to normal levels with recovery from the immunosuppressive effects of ALS. These results suggest that donor marrow suppresses the regeneration of donor-reactive CTL in the lymphoid tissues of ALS-treated mice, possibly by veto cell activity.",M1
1565635,"Long-term abrogation of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice by immunotherapy with anti-lymphocyte serum.We investigated the therapeutic effect of anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) on clinically overt diabetes by using a nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes mellitus. ALS given within 14 days of disease onset gradually reversed hyperglycemia with a 76% cumulative incidence of remission. Combined use of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies, but not anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibody alone, was also effective with overall 64% remission. Diabetic NOD mice that failed to respond to ALS treatment accepted subsequent islet isografts for a prolonged period (mostly greater than 100 days), whereas islet isografts in diabetic NOD mice previously treated with normal rabbit serum were all destroyed as acutely as isografts in untreated diabetic NOD mice. These results suggest that persistence of diabetes was due to irreversible beta-cell destruction and that ALS has indeed abrogated autoimmunity. In addition, ALS treatment at the time of islet isografting achieved significant prolongation of graft survival with 8 of 13 mice maintaining euglycemia for greater than 100 days. Although ALS prolonged islet allograft survival in diabetic NOD mice, the degree of prolongation was much less for allografts than for isografts, suggesting that ALS is capable of suppressing autoimmunity more effectively than allograft responses.",M1

Our current work examines the effectiveness of antilymphocyte serum and donor bone marrow cell infusion on the survival of very impure islet allografts. Treatment of B6AF1 mice with peritransplant antilymphocyte serum plus posttransplant infusion of donor (C3H/HeJ) bone marrow was very effective at prolonging contaminated allograft survival. <e>ALS</e> plus BMC was also effective for even more immunogenic allograft situations; mice that received contralateral transplants of adult and neonatal tissue, and mice that received dual transplants of adult islets. Long-term graft-bearing mice that originally received ALS and BMC were challenged with C3H/HeJ skin grafts. These mice exhibited several different types of response. Four of thirteen appeared sensitized to donor antigen, four rejected the skin grafts in approximate first-set fashion, and five showed limited prolongation, with skin grafts surviving 20-48 days. Long-term graft-bearing mice were also tested in in vitro proliferative assays. As responders in mixed lymphocyte reactions, splenocytes (SPC) from only one of eight appeared to show specific unresponsiveness to donor cells. Four of eight had a normal proliferative response and stimulation index to stimulation with C3H/HeJ SPC. SPC from three did not produce a normal stimulation index, but had an abnormally high (3x normal) background proliferation. SPC from seven of eight of these mice were able to suppress the proliferative response of naive B6AF1 SPC to C3H/HeJ cells. Our conclusions are that while ALS plus BMC are very effective in prolonging islet allograft survival, this treatment does not appear to be uniformly inducing a state of immunologic unresponsiveness in these mice. It appears that multiple mechanisms are acting to maintain islet allografts in this system, either independently or sequentially.",M1
1750080,"Prevention of graft-versus-host disease following small bowel transplantation with polyclonal and monoclonal antilymphocyte serum. The effect of timing and route of administration.Graft-versus-host disease is a potential problem following small bowel transplantation. We have previously shown that a two-day intraperitoneal course of polyclonal antilymphocyte serum completely prevents GVHD without impairing allograft function in a unidirectional rat small bowel transplant model. In the present study we sought to determine the optimum route and timing of <e>ALS</e> administration and whether donor pretreatment with the anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibody R73 would be similarly effective in preventing GVHD. Both intravenous and intraperitoneal injection of ALS effectively prevent GVHD in this model. ALS must be given to donors at least 48 hr prior to graft procurement for maximum effectiveness. Prevention of GVHD correlates with lymphocyte depletion in mesenteric lymph nodes, as opposed to peripheral blood or small bowel lamina propria. Donor pretreatment with the monoclonal antibody R73 significantly delays the onset of GVHD in this small bowel transplant model but appears less effective than polyclonal ALS.",M1

Recipients were treated with <e>ALS</e> from day -5 to day +7, relative to transplantation on day 0 with an MLR-mismatched donor. Fractionated donor bone marrow cells (BMFr3) obtained by density gradient separation were infused 3-7 days after ALS treatment. CsA treatments were begun either 3-7 days after ALS plus BMFr3 infusion or 3-7 days after treatments with ALS alone. Extended allograft survival was achieved at all CsA doses in BMFr3-infused, ALS-treated recipients. Allografts were sustained throughout the CsA treatment period without rejection in the majority of recipients (6 of 8) receiving ALS plus BMFr3 and CsA at 20 Mg/kg/day for 60 days. By contrast, few grafts were sustained through 30 days of treatment with CsA at 3.2 (1 of 12) or 10 mg/kg/day (2 of 9) in ALS plus BMFr3-treated recipients. Cyclosporine treatment was ineffective at all doses in augmenting allograft prolongation in ALS-treated recipients that did not receive BMFr3. Nearly all (6 of 7) long-term survivors (greater than 180 days) were BMFr3-treated. Peripheral blood lymphocytes or bone marrow cells of these long-term survivors proliferated normally in response to Con A and PWM, and were MLR responsive to third-party cells but did not have reduced MLR responsiveness to donor alloantigen in all cases. These long-term survivors promptly rejected third-party renal allografts without adverse effects on the original transplant's function. These results show that long-term renal allograft survival with specific unresponsiveness to the donor can result from the combined treatment with ALS plus donor BMFr3 and a limited course of CsA.",M1
2031261,"Induction of allograft tolerance with neonatal skin.B6AF1 recipients treated with various combinations of <e>ALS</e>, CsA, and BMC were grafted with C3H skin from adult or neonatal donors. A survival advantage of neonatal skin compared with adult skin was clearly demonstrated in groups treated with ALS and CsA (median survival time [MST] = 89 days, neonatal skin; 50 days, adult skin), ALS and BMC, (MST = 92 days, neonatal; 64 days, adult skin), or with ALS only (MST = 55 days and 35 days, respectively). In these groups only neonatal grafts were observed to survive greater than 100 days. Also, once it was underway, rejection of the neonatal skin proceeded more slowly than that of adult skin. ALS/BMC/CsA treatment of adult skin recipients improved graft survival modestly (MST = 77 days, 20% of grafts surviving greater than 100 days). But neonatal graft survival was prolonged remarkably by the ALS/BMC/CsA treatment, with 95% of grafts surviving greater than 100 days and 84% surviving greater than 240 days. After bearing neonatal grafts for greater than 150 days, these mice were challenged with C3H adult skin grafts. The second grafts were uniformly accepted for greater than 135 additional days, but third-party grafts were rejected promptly. This specific tolerance could not be abrogated by injection of normal B6AF1 spleen cells, and rejection of the grafts by adoptively transferred sensitized cells was delayed (MST = 35 days). That the tolerance developed in response to grafting neonatal skin to ALS/BMC/CsA-treated recipients extends to adult tissue suggests that understanding of the immunoregulatory signal provided by the neonatal tissue might lead to a tolerogenic protocol for use with adult allografts.",M1
2010049,"Production of marked prolongation of islet xenograft survival (rat to mouse) by local release of mouse and rat antilymphocyte sera at transplant site.Polymer rods impregnated with lyophilized particles of mouse (M) or rat (R) antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) were placed adjacent to rat islet xenografts transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of diabetic mice. Insertion of rods containing only MALS or RALS had no effect on the survival time of the rat islet xenografts. In contrast, the insertion of both MALS and RALS rods with the graft produced a marked prolongation of islet xenograft survival (mean survival time greater than 55.5 +/- 10.9 days) compared with controls (14.7 +/- 2.5 days). One recipient was still normoglycemic at 100 days, and removal of the graft returned the animal to a diabetic state. The islet graft had a normal degree of beta-granulation, and a slight fibrotic reaction was present around the rods. The effect of the rods in prolonging survival of the xenografts resulted from a local slow release of MALS and RALS, because implantation of the MALS and RALS rods in the right kidney and the islets in the left kidney had no effect on prolonging islet xenograft survival. These findings indicate that local immunosuppression produced marked prolongation of rat islet xenograft survival in mice. This raises the possibility of using polymer rods for the local slow release of monoclonal antibodies to lymphokines and other agents for prevention of rejection of islet allografts and xenografts and to determine the effect of lymphokines in vivo on islet function.",M1

Lymph node cells and thymocytes are only minimally effective in prolonging grafts. The effect of a hematopoietic growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was studied in this model of unresponsiveness. C3H/He lymphoid cell donors were treated with GM-CSF. Either normal or GM-CSF-treated cells were injected into ALS-treated B6AF1 mice grafted with C3H/He skin. GM-CSF treatment significantly augmented the effect of marrow in prolonging graft survival at doses of 1 to 25 x 10(6) cells. In contrast, GM-CSF had no effect on the graft-prolonging effect of spleen cells when 50 x 10(6) cells were given. When the dose of cells was reduced to 25 x 10(6), graft survival in the group given GM-CSF-treated cells was prolonged compared with survival in the group given normal cells. Grafts in the group given GM-CSF-treated lymph node cells were rejected in sensitized fashion. When marrow and spleen are separated on a Percoll gradient, the cell active in promoting graft survival is recovered primarily in the 52.5% fraction. The graft-prolonging effect of the 52.5% marrow fraction was not affected by GM-CSF treatment. In contrast, GM-CSF-treated marrow cells in the 60% fraction significantly prolonged graft survival, while normal marrow cells in this fraction had no effect on graft survival. GM-CSF-treated spleen cells in the 52.5% and 60% fractions significantly decreased graft survival compared with normal cells when given at a dose equal to the number of cells recovered from 50 x 10(6) cells. When the dose of fractionated spleen cells was reduced, GM-CSF-treated spleen cells were more effective than normal cells in prolonging graft survival. These results indicate that GM-CSF activates a cell in marrow that promotes graft survival. This cell is recovered in the 60% Percoll fraction. In contrast, GM-CSF appears to affect two cell populations in spleen, one beneficial and one detrimental to graft survival. The predominant effect depends on the dose of spleen cells that is given.",M1
1670969,"Characterization of spleen cells capable of inducing unresponsiveness in <e>ALS</e>-treated mice.C3H/He skin allografts are significantly prolonged in ALS-treated B6AF1 mice by the injection of 50 x 10(6) C3H/He spleen cells 1 week postgrafting. To identify and characterize the spleen cell active in promoting graft survival, C3H/He spleen cells were separated on a discontinuous Percoll gradient and the various fractions were assayed for the ability to prolong skin graft survival in ALS-treated B6AF1 mice. In addition, unfractionated spleen and spleen fractions were depleted of specific cell populations before injection to determine the effect of various cell populations on graft prolongation. The active cell was recovered primarily in the 52.5% Percoll fraction. Cells in the 60% fraction also had a graft-prolonging effect, but not as significant as that of the 52.5% fraction. Depletion of Thy 1, Ia and Ig-positive cells from unfractionated spleen or spleen fractions did not decrease the graft-prolonging effect. Both Fc gamma R-positive and Fc gamma R-negative cells prolonged graft survival, but the Fc gamma R- cells were the most effective. In contrast to the effect of spleen cells, lymph node cells and thymocytes are relatively ineffective in prolonging graft survival in ALS-treated mice. When lymph node lymphocytes and thymocytes were separated on a Percoll gradient, the cell population active in prolonging graft survival was recovered primarily in the 52.5% fraction. Treatment of the 52.5% fraction of lymph node lymphocytes or thymocytes with monoclonal antibody to Thy 1 before injection abrogated the graft-prolonging effect. These results indicate that the spleen cell(s) active in prolonging graft survival in ALS-treated mice is a non-T, non-B cell, as it lacks Thy 1, Ia, and Ig surface markers. Both Fc gamma R+ and Fc gamma R- spleen cells are effective in prolonging grafts, but Fc gamma R- cells are the most effective. In contrast, the active cell in lymph node and thymus is Thy 1-positive, indicating that it is a T lymphocyte.",M1
2256160,"Prolongation of adult skin allograft survival by cotransplantation of neonatal skin in antilymphocyte serum and donor bone marrow cell-treated mice.Adult male B6AF1 (H-2KIb/kDb/d) mice were given skin allografts from adult male C3H (H-2k) mice, with and without contralateral cotransplants. The cotransplants were of either adult or neonatal (less than 24 hr) C3H skin. In recipient mice treated peritransplantation with antilymphocyte serum and posttransplantation with an i.v. injection of donor-strain bone marrow cells, the presence of a neonatal cotransplant resulted in significantly longer survival of the adult grafts. Median survival time (MST) for adult grafts, for the group that received a neonatal cotransplant was greater than 100 days, in comparison to MSTs of 59 days and 55 days for the groups that received only single adult grafts or the adult graft with an adult cotransplant. These results suggest an active immunomodulatory contribution of neonatal tissue, and we term this phenomenon the  cotransplant effect.  This prolongation of survival of the adult grafts by the neonatal cotransplants was statistically significant in animals treated with <e>ALS</e> and BMC, but not in recipients that were treated with ALS only (MST = 34 days, in comparison with 29 days for groups that received either a single adult graft or an adult graft with an adult cotransplant). The graft-prolonging effects of an infusion of donor BMC thus appear to potentiate the expression of the cotransplant effect. An understanding of this effect may lead to improved methods of controlling the allograft response to adult tissues in the clinical setting.",M1

3260183,"The progression of the inflammation in established collagen-induced arthritis can be altered by treatments with immunological or pharmacological agents which inhibit T cell activities.Alterations in the progression of the inflammatory disease in mice with established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by in vivo treatments with either anti-T cell antibodies or an immunosuppressive drug, whose main targets of action are T cells, were studied. It was demonstrated that the in vivo administration of either monoclonal anti-L3T4, anti-Ly-2 or the combination of anti-L3T4 and anti-Ly-2 failed to modify the inflammatory disease after the arthritis had been initiated. Nevertheless, the progression of disease was decreased by treatments with rabbit anti-mouse lymphocyte sera (<e>ALS</e>) in mice with established CIA. While there was a substantial reduction in the proliferative responses to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) in these ALS-treated mice, proliferation to a B cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, was unaffected. Furthermore, treatments with anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) by itself did not alter the progression of the ongoing inflammatory disease, but combined treatments with both anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-L3T4 mAb prevented the further advancement of the arthritic disease. Although mice receiving either anti-Thy-1.2 alone or both anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-L3T4 exhibited complete absence of Thy-1+ cells within their inguinal lymph nodes, the proliferative responses to Con A by LN cells from mice treated with the combination of anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-L3T4 were drastically reduced compared to the responses of either the anti-Thy-1.2 or anti-L3T4-treated groups. Finally, daily treatments with cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug which preferentially acts on T cells, were also effective in modifying the clinical course of the arthritic disease in mice with established CIA. These results suggest that immunocompetent cells which express the Thy-1 surface marker, most likely Thy-1+ T cells, may play a role in maintaining and perpetuating the inflammatory disease of established CIA.",M1

B6AF1 mice bearing DBA/2 crude islet allografts for more than 100 days following ALS treatment accepted secondary DBA/2 crude islet allografts, but acutely rejected third-party A.SW crude islet allografts. This antigen-specific unresponsiveness to islet allografts can be successfully transferred into syngeneic B6AF1 mice by spleen cells. However, the state of unresponsiveness to donor antigen observed in these animals appears to be relatively weak, since transplantation of DBA/2 skin allografts or injection of DBA/2 spleen cells (5 x 10(7] caused acute rejection of long-term-accepted islet allografts. In contrast, B6AF1 mice bearing DBA/2 purified islet allografts over 100 days without immunosuppression rejected the secondary DBA/2 crude islet allografts acutely. Transfer of spleen cells obtained from these animals to syngeneic B6AF1 mice failed to induce prolongation of DBA/2 crude islet allografts. Thus, the mechanism (or mechanisms) involved in the long-term acceptance of islet allografts induced by the use of ALS and crude islets appears to be different from that involved in the long-term acceptance of purified islet allografts. The possible roles played by ALS in the induction of specific unresponsiveness to islet allografts are discussed.",M1
10302355,"Economic analysis of an immunosuppressive strategy in renal transplantation.Recently introduced immunosuppressants, which have been shown to be more effective but apparently more costly than conventional regimens, have renewed interest in the economic evaluation of national policies regarding the management of end-stage renal disease. The present paper addresses these questions, together with the different methods of expressing the costs involved, with reference to a sequential protocol using anti-lymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>), followed by cyclosporine from the third post-graft month onwards. The analysis is based on the results of a randomized trial carried out at the University Hospital, Nantes (France), from 1982 to 1984, in which the above protocol was compared to conventional treatment with ALS alone. Despite the considerable cost of long-term cyclosporine treatment, analysis reveals collective financial and social benefits from the reduced rate of graft failure and subsequent return to dialysis.",M1
3314751,"The selective use of antilymphocyte serum for cyclosporine treated patients with renal allograft dysfunction.Eighty-seven adult renal allograft recipients were initially treated with cyclosporine-prednisone immunosuppression. Thirty patients experienced no episode of rejection. Antilymphocyte antibody therapy (<e>ALS</e>) was administered to 21 of the 68 recipients of cadaveric donor allografts for either primary allograft dysfunction or acute rejection, and to 6 of 19 recipients of haploidentical, living-related allografts because of steroid-resistant rejection. The cumulative allograft and patient survival for the entire series (follow-up 9-36 months) was 84% and 95%, respectively. This improvement in the rate of successful transplantation can be attributed to the selective addition of ALS therapy to recipients with specific instances of renal allograft dysfunction. In this report, the indications for the use of ALS preparations following prophylactic CsA immunosuppression are reviewed. Experience with the protocols of the ALS administration is also discussed. In selected cases, the administration of either ATG or OKT3 can significantly benefit CsA recipients who experience either primary allograft nonfunction or an epidose of acute rejection.",M1
3672514,"The effect of immunosuppressants and adoptive transfer in monocrotaline pyrrole pneumotoxicity.Monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP) is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid that causes pulmonary vascular injury and pulmonary hypertension in rats. The lesions in lungs of MCTP-treated rats are similar to those occurring in humans with primary pulmonary hypertension. Thus, the MCTP-treated rat is a good animal model for this disease. The mechanisms by which MCTP causes lung injury are unknown. The character of the pulmonary lesions and the delay in onset of the injury after a single low dose of MCTP suggest that immune mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis. Accordingly, rats were treated with MCTP and the immunosuppressants antilymphocyte serum (<e>ALS</e>) or cyclosporin A (CyA). Neither ALS nor CyA completely protected rats from the injury due to MCTP. Several series of experiments also were undertaken to assess the effect of lymphocytes adoptively transferred from MCTP-treated donor rats into MCTP-treated recipient rats. Adoptive transfer of lymphocytes did not decrease the onset time of the injury or increase the severity of lesions due to MCTP in the recipients. These results indicate that immune mechanisms are probably not involved in MCTP-induced pulmonary injury.",M1

We have now studied the effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in a mouse skin allograft model using this protocol (C3H skin grafted to B6AF1 mice, day 0; i.p. ALS on days -1 and +2; i.v. bone marrow days +6 or +7). When PBLs are injected in place of bone marrow cells, graft survival is extended beyond that noted for control mice given ALS only. The timing and specificity of this phenomenon suggest that it resembles the effect produced by posttransplant bone marrow administration and not that associated with pretransplant blood transfusion. The PBLs active in graft prolongation are Thy-1-negative and display a density in Percoll gradients similar to that of the active marrow cells. In contrast, when PBLs are injected in combination with bone marrow cells, the length of graft survival is shortened in comparison with that produced by bone marrow alone. The cells associated with this partial abrogation of the effectiveness of bone marrow appear to be mature T cells; this abrogation cannot be produced by PBLs treated with anti-Thy-1 plus complement or by thymocytes, but it is a property of lymph node cells enriched for T cells by nylon-wool fractionation. This study suggests that clinical application of this posttransplantation induction of specific allograft unresponsiveness can be facilitated by the use of peripheral blood lymphocytes rather than marrow, sparing a living organ donor from having to undergo bone marrow harvest. Additionally, the data indicate that contamination of marrow with blood lymphocytes should be minimized. However, the density gradient fractionation method that we have found to be effective in preparing the graft prolonging bone marrow cells simultaneously removes the PBLs deleterious to graft survival.",M1

The data obtained indicate that donor-specific transfusion decreased both the frequency of reactive precursors and their proliferative potential after activation. Additional studies implied that these changes may be associated with a serum- or cell-mediated antigen-specific suppressive mechanism. Further manipulations aimed at preferentially sparing or enhancing the activity of suppressor T cells prolonged skin graft survival in pretransfused mice and led to the presence of suppressor T cells in the spleen of such mice, which were active upon adoptive transfer. These manipulations included the use of pretransplant donor-specific transfusion, administration of <e>ALS</e> or cyclosporin-A, or the use of posttransplant injection with a T suppressor activating factor (SAF). Optimum graft survival was associated with combined treatment when using transfusion, SAF, and cyclosporin-A.",M1

Density gradient fractionation of the active bone marrow cells.Antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated recipient mice that are infused with donor bone marrow cells have been shown to enjoy prolonged skin graft survival. In the present experiments, discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in Percoll was used to prepare fractions of these cells. Two of four fractions had good graft-prolonging ability. In experiments in which the density of the gradients was varied, we were able to estimate the density of a major portion of the cells active in graft prolongation as being in a range of 1.061 to 1.066 g/ml, and to produce one fraction with superior graft-prolonging activity. This fraction constituted only 10% of the recovered cells, was enriched for small-to-medium lymphocytes, Ia+, Thy-1+, and IgM+ cells, and contained cells bearing a marker known to be present on active cells, Fc gamma R. Additionally, this fraction contained cells capable of suppressing the mixed lymphocyte reaction, although two denser fractions, of poor-to-good graft-prolonging ability, also shared this ability.

Duration of ALS symptoms correlated positively with levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and negatively with levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

They differ from the accepted revised El-Escorial criteria by considering fasciculation potentials to be evidence of acute denervation. In addition, when assessing diagnostic certainty, the Awaji-shima criteria equate electrodiagnostic evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction with clinical examination findings. METHODS: A retrospective review of 205 consecutive sets of notes was performed, from patients who underwent neurophysiological assessment for suspected MND. The clinical signs and neurophysiological findings were combined according to the two sets of criteria (revised El-Escorial and Awaji-shima), and the diagnoses reached were compared with the interval diagnosis, to establish the sensitivities and specificities of each protocol. RESULTS: An interval diagnosis of MND was recorded in 107 patients. The sensitivity of the Awaji-shima criteria in reaching a diagnosis of MND was 60.7% and the revised El-Escorial 28%, with a specificity of 95.9% for both criteria. The Awaji-shima criteria increased the sensitivity of diagnosis without affecting the specificity. CONCLUSION: Accepting EMG evidence of fasciculations as evidence of acute denervation increases the diagnostic certainty of MND, and the new criteria allow earlier diagnosis of MND without increasing the false-positive rate.",M2
20517935,"FUS-immunoreactive inclusions are a common feature in sporadic and non-SOD1 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is a fatal disorder of motor neuron degeneration. Most cases of ALS are sporadic (SALS), but about 5 to 10% of ALS cases are familial (FALS). Recent studies have shown that mutations in FUS are causal in approximately 4 to 5% of FALS and some apparent SALS cases. The pathogenic mechanism of the mutant FUS-mediated ALS and potential roles of FUS in non-FUS ALS remain to be investigated. METHODS: Immunostaining was performed on postmortem spinal cords from 78 ALS cases, including SALS (n = 52), ALS with dementia (ALS/dementia, n = 10), and FALS (n = 16). In addition, postmortem brains or spinal cords from 22 cases with or without frontotemporal lobar degeneration were also studied. In total, 100 cases were studied. RESULTS: FUS-immunoreactive inclusions were observed in spinal anterior horn neurons in all SALS and FALS cases, except for those with SOD1 mutations. The FUS-containing inclusions were also immunoreactive with antibodies to TDP43, p62, and ubiquitin. A fraction of tested FUS antibodies recognized FUS inclusions, and specific antigen retrieval protocol appeared to be important for detection of the skein-like FUS inclusions. INTERPRETATION: Although mutations in FUS account for only a small fraction of FALS and SALS, our data suggest that FUS protein may be a common component of the cellular inclusions in non-SOD1 ALS and some other neurodegenerative conditions, implying a shared pathogenic pathway underlying SALS, non-SOD1 FALS, ALS/dementia, and related disorders. Our data also indicate that SOD1-linked ALS may have a pathogenic pathway distinct from SALS and other types of FALS.",M2

20515040,"Disrupted zinc-binding sites in structures of pathogenic SOD1 variants D124V and H80R.Mutations in human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause an inherited form of the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). Here, we present structures of the pathogenic SOD1 variants D124V and H80R, both of which demonstrate compromised zinc-binding sites. The disruption of the zinc-binding sites in H80R SOD1 leads to conformational changes in loop elements, permitting non-native SOD1-SOD1 interactions that mediate the assembly of these proteins into higher-order filamentous arrays. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that these SOD1 variants are more prone to monomerization than the wild-type enzyme. Although D124V and H80R SOD1 proteins appear to have fully functional copper-binding sites, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (ICP-MS) and anomalous scattering X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that zinc (not copper) occupies the copper-binding sites in these variants. The absence of copper in these proteins, together with the results of covalent thiol modification experiments in yeast strains with and without the gene encoding the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS), suggests that CCS may not fully act on newly translated forms of these polypeptides. Overall, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that immature mutant SOD1 species contribute to toxicity in SOD1-linked ALS.",M2

A cross-sectional study was performed on 79 patients with DM1 and 74 with ALS. The HRQoL was evaluated by SF-36, Serbian version. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton rating scale for depression and the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety respectively. Severity of muscular involvement in DM1 was measured with MRC scale and severity of ALS with ALSFRSr score. The mean total score as well as all domain scores of SF-36 were similar in DM1 and ALS patients (p &gt; 0.05), except that ALS patients experienced less bodily pain (p &lt; 0.05). Depressiveness was found in 51% and marked anxiety in 38% of DM1 patients. Emotional status and severity of muscular involvement emerged as significant independent contributing factors to the total SF-36 in DMI patients (p &lt; 0.05). Only 3% of ALS patients showed depressiveness and 4% anxiety symptoms.

20498436,"Tau levels do not influence human <e>ALS</e> or motor neuron degeneration in the SOD1G93A mouse.BACKGROUND: The microtubule-associated protein tau is thought to play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration. Mutations in the tau coding gene MAPT are a cause of frontotemporal dementia, and the H1/H1 genotype of MAPT, giving rise to higher tau expression levels, is associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Parkinson disease (PD). Furthermore, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), and reducing endogenous tau has been reported to ameliorate cognitive impairment in a mouse model for AD. Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation have also been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both in human patients and in the mutant SOD1 mouse model for this disease. However, the precise role of tau in motor neuron degeneration remains uncertain. METHODS: The possible association between ALS and the MAPT H1/H2 polymorphism was studied in 3,540 patients with ALS and 8,753 controls. Furthermore, the role of tau in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model for ALS was studied by deleting Mapt in this model. RESULTS: The MAPT genotype of the H1/H2 polymorphism did not influence ALS susceptibility (odds ratio = 1.08 [95% confidence interval 0.99-1.18], p = 0.08) and did not affect the clinical phenotype. Lowering tau levels in the SOD1(G93A) mouse failed to delay disease onset (p = 0.302) or to increase survival (p = 0.557). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the H1/H2 polymorphism in MAPT is not associated with human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and that lowering tau levels in the mutant SOD1 mouse does not affect the motor neuron degeneration in these animals.",M2
20467334,"Differential histone deacetylase mRNA expression patterns in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important regulators of gene expression and cell differentiation. The HDAC inhibitors have recently been considered as potential novel neuroprotective drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). A major limitation, however, lies in the broad spectrum of action of currently available HDAC inhibitors that may cause a variety of toxic side effects. The mRNA expression levels of the HDAC isoforms HDACs 1 to 11 have previously been characterized in rat brain but have not been studied in human tissue. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry we assessed the distribution and expression levels of HDACs 1to 11 in postmortem ALS and control brain and spinal cord specimens (n = 6 cases each) to determine alterations in the mRNA expression pattern that could provide a basis for disease-specific therapies. We found a reduction of HDAC 11 mRNA and increased HDAC 2 levels in ALS brain and spinal cord compared with controls.

20467332,"Neuropathologic and biochemical changes during disease progression in liver X receptor beta-/- mice, a model of adult neuron disease.In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), there is selective degeneration of motor neurons that leads to paralysis and death. Although the etiology of ALS is unclear, its heterogeneity suggests that a combination of factors (endogenous and/or environmental) may induce progressive motor neuron stress that results in the activation of different cell death pathways. Alterations of brain cholesterol homeostasis have recently been considered as possible cofactors in many neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS. The liver X receptor beta (LXRbeta) receptor is involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol metabolism, and we previously found that adult-onset motor neuron pathology occurs in LXRbeta mice. Here, we investigated neuromuscular alterations of LXRbeta mice from ages 3 to 24 months. Increased cholesterol levels, gliosis, and inflammation preceded motor neuron loss and clinical disease onset; the mice showed progressivemotor neuron deficits starting from age 7 months. The numbers ofmotor neurons and neuromuscular junctions were decreased in 24-month-old mice, but neither paralysis nor reduced life span was observed. Moreover, other spinal neurons were also lost in these mice. These results suggest that LXRbeta may inhibit neuroinflammation and maintain cholesterol homeostasis, and that LXRbeta mice represent a potential model for investigating the role of cholesterol in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders.",M2
20460594,"Four familial <e>ALS</e> pedigrees discordant for two SOD1 mutations: are all SOD1 mutations pathogenic?BACKGROUND: 153 mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been claimed to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in familial and sporadic ALS in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern with complete or reduced penetrance. The authors now report four ALS pedigrees from Finland, France, Germany and Sweden with either the D90A or E100K SOD1 mutations in some but not all affected members. After re-collecting DNA, the non-segregation of the SOD1 mutations with disease was confirmed by three independent laboratories using different PCR primers: while some of the affected patients carry SOD1 mutations, other affected family members have two wildtype/normal SOD1 genes. In addition, some unaffected members within the same families are carriers of SOD1 gene mutations. To exclude other known genetic causes, the authors ruled out mutations within the genes coding for VAPB, ANG, TDP43, FUS and DCTN1 in affected individuals in the four pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS: The authors find that the D90A and E100K SOD1 gene mutations found in some patients are not the exclusive cause of ALS in these pedigrees. Whether this is also the case for the other 151 SOD1 mutations reported in ALS pedigrees is unknown. The findings have consequences for genetic testing in clinical practice when diagnosing ALS and for genetic counselling in ALS. Some SOD1 mutations may be part of an oligo- or epigentic pattern of inheritance. Such a pattern of inheritance may model other oligo- or polygenetic traits responsible for other forms of ALS.",M2
20460191,"Electroacupuncture reduces neuroinflammatory responses in symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is a paralyzing disorder that is characterized by the progressive degeneration and death of motor neurons. Acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) has been used for the treatment of various conditions including osteoarthritis, asthma, and other types of chronic pain conditions. It has been hypothesized that acupuncture exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects on inflammatory reactions processes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether acupuncture at a specific acupoint could produce anti-inflammatory responses and suppress motor neuron loss in the hG93ASOD1 mouse, commonly used as a model for inherited ALS. We delivered EA at the Zusanli (ST36) acupuncture point in the symptomatic hSOD1G93A animal model. The EA-treated mutant hSOD1 transgenic mice showed decreases in microglial cell activity and TNF-alpha expression in the spinal cord and brain stem. Furthermore, EA significantly improved motor activity compared to the control group and reduced neuronal cell loss in hSOD1G93A mice. Our research suggests a potential functional link between EA therapy and anti-neuroinflammatory response in an ALS animal model.",M2
20457961,"Identification of 2 Loci at chromosomes 9 and 14 in a multiplex family with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that can be accompanied by signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel gene for FTLD-ALS. DESIGN: Genome-wide linkage study in a multiplex family with FTLD-ALS with subsequent fine mapping and mutation analyses. SETTING: Memory Clinic of the Middelheim General Hospital. PATIENTS: An extended Belgian family with autosomal dominant FTLD-ALS, DR14, with a mean age at onset of 58.1 years (range, 51-65 years [n = 9]) and mean disease duration of 6.4 years (range, 1-17 years [n = 9]). The proband with clinical FTLD showed typical FTLD pathology with neuronal ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions that were positive for the transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Linkage to chromosome 9 and 14. RESULTS: We found significant linkage to chromosome 9p23-q21 (multipoint logarithm of odds [LOD] score = 3.38) overlapping with a known FTLD-ALS locus (ALSFTD2) and nearly significant linkage to a second locus at chromosome 14q31-q32 (multipoint LOD score = 2.79). Obligate meiotic recombinants defined candidate regions of 74.7 megabase pairs (Mb) at chromosome 9 and 14.6 Mb near the telomere of chromosome 14q. In both loci, the disease haplotype segregated in all patients in the family. Mutation analysis of selected genes and copy number variation analysis in both loci did not reveal segregating pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Family DR14 provides additional significant evidence for the importance of the chromosome 9 gene to FTLD-ALS and reveals a possible novel locus for FTLD-ALS at chromosome 14. The identification of the underlying genetic defect(s) will significantly contribute to the understanding of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms in FTLD, ALS, and associated neurodegenerative disorders.",M2
20448480,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress in motor neurons of the spinal cord in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen causes a cellular stress response termed the unfolded protein response. Although ER stress has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, the morphological features of aggregated proteins in ER lumina that may cause neurodegeneration have not been well characterized. We examined anterior horn neurons using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in 12 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) patients and 12 controls. Approximately 2.6% of both normal-appearing and degenerated motor neurons in ALS cases were immunostained for the ER chaperone protein glucose-regulated protein 78, and approximately 0.1% of these neurons was glucose-regulated protein 78 positive in controls (p = 0.0004). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases also tended to have glucose-regulated protein 78-positive motor neurons more frequently than control cases (p = 0.08). By electron microscopy,neurons in ALS patients showed accumulations of amorphous and granular material suggestive of misfolded or unfolded proteins in dilated predominantly normal-appearing ER. There were also wavy membranous structures extending from the ER membranes that lacked membrane-bound ribosomes, electron-dense material resembling Bunina bodies, Hirano bodies, honeycomb-like structures, and membrane-particle complexes associated with the ER in these neurons. Control sample neurons demonstrated none of these features. These ER alterations suggest that the unfolded protein response is activated in motor neurons in ALS patients and provide the first morphological evidence that ER stress may be involved in the neurodegeneration of motor neurons in early stages of sporadic ALS.",M2

20428114,"Mutations of optineurin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) has its onset in middle age and is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons of the primary motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.",M2
20420185,"[Language impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]For a long time, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) was thought to be a neuro-degenerative disease with selective involvement of the motor neuron system. However, it has recently been established that ALS is a multisystem disorder that not only involve the motor system but also affects cognition. A typical cognitive impairment in ALS is frontotemporal dementia: a clinical subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Furthermore, language impairment, including progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA) and semantic dementia (SD), which are also FTLD subtypes, have been linked to bulbar-onset ALS. Beside recent studies a Japanese paper published in 1893 gives an account of aphasia in bulbar-onset ALS. Interestingly, this was the first account of aphasia in Japan. Thus, language-related problems in ALS may have been overlooked, because evaluation of aphasic problems in ALS patients is difficult, mainly because of progressive bulbar or pseudo-bulbar palsy that results in and dysarthria. From a clinical point of view, progressing bulbar symptoms and medical interventions, such artificial ventilation make it difficult to evaluate language functions in ALS. However, we do observe frequent omission and paragraphia of kana letters, and syntactic errors in writing. Interestingly, some patients make exhibit errors exclusively in the case of kanji characters. Thus, evaluation of writing samples is important if order to identify language problems in ALS patients. The findings may also provide additional information such as dissociation between errors made in kana and kanji characters. The characteristic features of writing errors are thought to reflect the nature of aphasia including PA and SD, that are easily masked by dysarthria. In addition, writing errors can appear as  isolated agraphia  without aphasia and dementia. Pathologically, writing errors should indicate the brain regions involved by ALS, e.g., hemispheric dominance and frontal or temporal lobe involvement. In addition, selective involvement of Exner's writing center in the frontal lobe may be responsible for  isolated agraphia . Hence, further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of writing errors in ALS patients and their pathological correlation.",M2
20406759,"Association between blood lead and the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The authors conducted a 2003-2007 case-control study including 184 cases and 194 controls to examine the association between blood lead and the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) among US veterans and to explore the influence on this association of bone turnover and genetic factors related to lead toxicokinetics. Blood lead, plasma biomarkers of bone formation (procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (PINP)) and resorption (C-terminal telopeptides of type 1 collagen (CTX)), and the K59N polymorphism in the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase gene, ALAD, were measured. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of blood lead with ALS were estimated with unconditional logistic regression after adjustment for age and bone turnover. Blood lead levels were higher among cases compared with controls (P &lt; 0.0001, age adjusted). A doubling of blood lead was associated with a 1.9-fold increased risk of ALS (95% confidence interval: 1.3, 2.7) after adjustment for age and CTX. Additional adjustment for PINP did not alter the results. Significant lead-ALS associations were observed in substrata of PINP and CTX levels. The K59N polymorphism in the ALAD gene did not modify the lead-ALS association (P = 0.32). These results extend earlier findings by accounting for bone turnover in confirming the association between elevated blood lead level and higher risk of ALS.",M2
20385912,"Novel FUS/TLS mutations and pathology in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of and clinicopathologic phenotypes associated with FUS/TLS mutations in a large cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) cases from the north of England. DESIGN: Genetic screening project with neuropathologic examination of postmortem tissue in selected cases. The clinical details of selected cases are also presented. SETTING: Neurology departments of 2 university teaching hospitals in the north of England. PARTICIPANTS: The 15 exons of FUS/TLS were sequenced in an initial cohort of 42 familial ALS (FALS) and 117 sporadic ALS (SALS) cases. Exons 14 and 15 were subsequently screened in a larger cohort of 431 SALS cases. Regions mutated in ALS cases were also screened in 293 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Evaluation of gene-sequencing chromatographs and detailed histopathologic analysis of the central nervous system. RESULTS: Four heterozygous mutations, 1 of which is novel, were identified in 6 patients with ALS (4 with FALS and 2 with SALS). Two of the substitutions were not found to be present in controls, and neuropathology in these cases revealed neuronal and/or glial cytoplasmic inclusions positive for the FUS/TLS protein. One of these cases is also the first reported SALS case with an FUS/TLS mutation. The other 2 substitutions identified were also identified in control cases. Neuropathology in these cases revealed typical SALS pathology, suggesting that they are likely to represent benign polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: FUS/TLS mutations represented approximately 5% of FALS cases screened. A FUS/TLS mutation was also identified in a single SALS case. Subsequent screening of this region in a larger cohort of SALS cases, however, did not reveal any additional mutations.",M2
20383809,"Neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) model in vitro. Ultrastructural study.Erythropoietin (EPO) is a chemokine hormone that is widely distributed throughout the body including nervous system. For last years its role as cytokine involved in many physiological processes out of the bone marrow has been suggested. Moreover, it plays a very important role in CNS as potential neuroprotective agent. There is much evidence that EPO protects neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo models of brain injury, independently of its erythropoietic action. The aim of this study was to determine the potential neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin on the glutamate-mediated injury of motor neurons (MNs) in vitro. The study was performed on organotypic cultures of the rat lumbar spinal cord subjected to glutamate uptake blocker, DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (THA) and pretreated with EPO. Ultrastructural study evidenced that the spinal cord cultures pretreated with EPO exhibited less severe neuronal injury. The cultures exposed to EPO + THA showed inhibition of early MNs degeneration, including various mode of degenerative changes caused by THA, whereas in the later period the typical postsynaptic necrotic changes of neuronal cells occurred. However, the ultrastructural characteristics of apoptotic MNs changes were not observed during the whole period of observation. The results of this study indicate that, in the model of chronic glutamate excitotoxicity, EPO exhibits the neuroprotective ability mainly through prevention of apoptotic neuronal changes.",M2

20377183,"Elimination of the native structure and solubility of the hVAPB MSP domain by the Pro56Ser mutation that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The Pro56Ser mutation in the human VAPB MSP domain causes a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here we present the first structural investigation of both wild-type and Pro56Ser mutant MSP domains. The results reveal that the wild-type MSP domain is well-folded at neutral pH but can undergo acid-induced unfolding reversibly. It has a thermodynamic stability energy (DeltaG degrees (N-U)) of 7.40 kcal/mol and is also active in binding to a Nir2 peptide with a K(D) of 0.65 muM. Further determination of its crystal structure reveals that it adopts a seven-strand immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich in which Pro56 adopts the unusual cis-peptide bond conformation that appears to be critical in maintaining the characteristic S-shaped loop. Markedly, the Pro56Ser mutation renders the MSP domain insoluble in buffer. Nevertheless, as facilitated by our recent discovery that  insoluble proteins  can be solubilized in salt-free water, we have successfully characterized the residue-specific conformation of the Pro56Ser mutant by CD and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The Pro56Ser mutant remains lacking of the native tight packing and secondary structures under various conditions and was further characterized as having a non-native helical conformation weakly populated at pH 3.5. Intriguingly, Pro12 located in another S-shaped loop also adopts the cis-peptide bond conformation, and its mutation to Ser is able to make the MSP domain highly insoluble and unfolded like the Pro56Ser mutant. Our study thus implies that the Pro56Ser mutation might lead to <e>ALS</e> by eliminating the native MSP structure, which consequently leads to aggregation and loss of functions under physiological conditions.",M2
20376892,"How respiratory muscle strength correlates with cough capacity in patients with respiratory muscle weakness.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate how respiratory muscle strength correlates to cough capacity in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), 43 with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), and 42 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were recruited. Pulmonary function tests including forced vital capacity (FVC) and respiratory muscle strength (maximal expiratory pressure, MEP; maximal inspiratory pressure, MIP) were performed. The correlation between respiratory muscle strength and cough capacity was analyzed. RESULTS: In the SCI group, FVC in a supine position (2,597 +/- 648 mL) was significantly higher than FVC in a sitting position (2,304 +/- 564 mL, p &lt; 0.01). Conversely, in the ALS group, FVC sitting (1,370 +/- 604 mL) was significantly higher than in supine (1,168 +/- 599 mL, p &lt; 0.01). In the DMD group, there was no statistically significant difference between FVC while sitting (1,342 +/- 506 mL) and FVC while supine (1,304 +/- 500 mL). In addition, the MEP and MIP of all three groups showed a significant correlation with peak cough flow (PCF) (p &lt; 0.01, Pearson's correlation analysis). In the SCI group, MIP was more closely correlated with PCF, while in the ALS and DMD groups, MEP was more closely correlated with PCF (p &lt; 0.01, multiple regression analysis). CONCLUSION: To generate cough flow, inspiratory muscle strength is significantly more important for SCI patients, while expiratory muscle function is significantly more important for ALS and DMD patients.",M2

20368421,"Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with a mutation in D-amino acid oxidase.We report a unique mutation in the D-amino acid oxidase gene (R199W DAO) associated with classical adult onset familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) in a three generational FALS kindred, after candidate gene screening in a 14.52 cM region on chromosome 12q22-23 linked to disease. Neuronal cell lines expressing R199W DAO showed decreased viability and increased ubiquitinated aggregates compared with cells expressing the wild-type protein. Similarly, lentiviral-mediated expression of R199W DAO in primary motor neuron cultures caused increased TUNEL labeling. This effect was also observed when motor neurons were cocultured on transduced astrocytes expressing R199W, indicating that the motor neuron cell death induced by this mutation is mediated by both cell autonomous and noncell autonomous processes. DAO controls the level of D-serine, which accumulates in the spinal cord in cases of sporadic <e>ALS</e> and in a mouse model of ALS, indicating that this abnormality may represent a fundamental component of ALS pathogenesis.",M2

We aimed to confirm or disprove these findings by assessing the safety and efficacy of lithium in combination with riluzole in patients with ALS. METHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a time-to-event design. Between January and June, 2009, patients with ALS who were taking a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised computer to receive either lithium or placebo. Patients, caregivers, investigators, and all site study staff with the exception of site pharmacists were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the time to an event, defined as a decrease of at least six points on the revised ALS functional rating scale score or death. Interim analyses were planned for when 84 patients had been allocated treatment, 6 months later or after 55 events, and after 100 events. Analysis was by intention to treat. The stopping boundary for futility at the first interim analysis was a p value of at least 0.68. We used a log-rank test to compare the distributions of the time to an event between the lithium and placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00818389. FINDINGS: At the first interim analysis, 22 of 40 patients in the lithium group had an event compared with 20 of 44 patients in the placebo group (log rank p=0.51). The hazard ratio of reaching the primary endpoint was 1.13 (95% CI 0.61-2.07). The study was stopped at the first interim analysis because criterion for futility was met (p=0.78). The difference in mean decline in the ALS functional rating scale score between the lithium group and the placebo group was 0.15 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.73, p=0.61). There were no major safety concerns. Falls (p=0.04) and back pain (p=0.05) were more common in the lithium group than in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence that lithium in combination with riluzole slows progression of ALS more than riluzole alone. The time-to-event endpoint and use of prespecified interim analyses enabled a clear result to be obtained rapidly. This design should be considered for future trials testing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs that are easily accessible to people with ALS.

20361056,"Transgenic rat model of neurodegeneration caused by mutation in the TDP gene.TDP-43 proteinopathies have been observed in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 (i.e., TDP) have been identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) and in frontotemporal lobe degeneration associated with motor neuron disease. To study the consequences of TDP mutation in an intact system, we created transgenic rats expressing normal human TDP or a mutant form of human TDP with a M337V substitution. Overexpression of mutant, but not normal, TDP caused widespread neurodegeneration that predominantly affected the motor system. TDP mutation reproduced ALS phenotypes in transgenic rats, as seen by progressive degeneration of motor neurons and denervation atrophy of skeletal muscles. This robust rat model also recapitulated features of TDP-43 proteinopathies including the formation of TDP-43 inclusions, cytoplasmic localization of phosphorylated TDP-43, and fragmentation of TDP-43 protein. TDP transgenic rats will be useful for deciphering the mechanisms underlying TDP-43-related neurodegenerative diseases.",M2

Increasing evidence supports the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in both inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typical of these pathological conditions.

On the other hand, by preventing excitotoxic damage, cannabinoids protect neuronal integrity and function.

Furthermore, we observed that this pathway is upregulated in the blood of 56% of human patients with ALS. A therapy using a monoclonal antibody to CD40L was developed that slows weight loss, delays paralysis and extends survival in an ALS mouse model. This work demonstrates that unbiased transcript profiling can identify cellular pathways responsive to therapeutic intervention in a preclinical model of human disease.",M2
20346106,"Downregulation of genes with a function in axon outgrowth and synapse formation in motor neurones of the VEGFdelta/delta mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell mitogen that stimulates vasculogenesis. It has also been shown to act as a neurotrophic factor in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of the hypoxia response element of the promoter region of the gene encoding VEGF in mice causes a reduction in neural VEGF expression, and results in adult-onset motor neurone degeneration that resembles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). Investigating the molecular pathways to neurodegeneration in the VEGFdelta/delta mouse model of ALS may improve understanding of the mechanisms of motor neurone death in the human disease. RESULTS: Microarray analysis was used to determine the transcriptional profile of laser captured spinal motor neurones of transgenic and wild-type littermates at 3 time points of disease. 324 genes were significantly differentially expressed in motor neurones of presymptomatic VEGFdelta/delta mice, 382 at disease onset, and 689 at late stage disease. Massive transcriptional downregulation occurred with disease progression, associated with downregulation of genes involved in RNA processing at late stage disease. VEGFdelta/delta mice showed reduction in expression, from symptom onset, of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, and genes involved in nervous system development, including axonogenesis, synapse formation, growth factor signalling pathways, cell adhesion and microtubule-based processes. These changes may reflect a reduced capacity of VEGFdelta/delta mice for maintenance and remodelling of neuronal processes in the face of demands of neural plasticity. The findings are supported by the demonstration that in primary motor neurone cultures from VEGFdelta/delta mice, axon outgrowth is significantly reduced compared to wild-type littermates. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of these genes involved in axon outgrowth and synapse formation in adult mice suggests a hitherto unrecognized role of VEGF in the maintenance of neuronal circuitry. Dysregulation of VEGF may lead to neurodegeneration through synaptic regression and dying-back axonopathy.",M2
20345765,"Intracerebroventricular infusion of monoclonal antibody or its derived Fab fragment against misfolded forms of SOD1 mutant delays mortality in a mouse model of <e>ALS</e>.The finding of a secretion pathway and toxicity for mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) raised up the possibility of using immunization approaches to reduce or neutralize the burden of toxic SOD1 species in the nervous system. Here we tested a passive immunization approach based on intracerebroventricular infusion in G93A-SOD1 mice of monoclonal antibodies specific to misfolded forms of SOD1 (mSOD1). We tested two monoclonal antibodies that bind distinct epitopes in mSOD1 and that do not bind to intact wild-type (WT) SOD1. One antibody succeeded in reducing the level of mSOD1 by 23% in the spinal cord and in prolonging the lifespan of G93A-SOD1 mice in proportion to the duration of treatment. However, another monoclonal antibody binding to a different SOD1 epitope failed to confer protection indicating that not all anti-SOD1 antibodies might be suitable for immunotherapy. Interestingly, the variable Fab fragment of an anti-SOD1 antibody was sufficient to confer some protection in G93A-SOD1 mice. The partial dispensability of Fc region should offer some advantages for development of immunotherapy with antibodies of smaller molecular size and low immunogenicity. From these results, we propose that passive immunization strategies should be considered as potential avenues for treatment of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by SOD1 mutations.",M2
20308682,"CSF glial markers correlate with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.BACKGROUND: In neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), CSF biomarkers are increasingly studied to evaluate their relevance for differential diagnosis, disease progression, and understanding of pathophysiologic processes. OBJECTIVE: To identify a biomarker profile of neuronal and glial CSF proteins to discriminate ALS from other motor neuron diseases (MND) and to assess whether baseline levels of CSF measures in ALS are associated with the course of the disease. METHODS: A total of 122 consecutive subjects with MND were included in this cross-sectional study (ALS, n = 75; lower motor neuron syndrome, n = 39; upper motor neuron diseases, n = 8). Clinical follow-up included 76 patients. We determined baseline levels of protein tau and astroglial S100beta in CSF and microglial sCD14 in CSF and serum in relation to diagnosis, duration of disease, and survival. RESULTS: CSF tau was significantly elevated in ALS and upper motor neuron diseases as compared to lower motor neuron diseases and controls. CSF S100beta levels were significantly lower in lower motor neuron diseases as compared to other MND. CSF concentrations of S100beta and sCD14 correlated with the survival time in patients with ALS. CONCLUSIONS: In motor neuron diseases, CSF tau elevation indicates the degeneration of upper motor neurons, while S100 beta and sCD14 may indicate the activation of CNS glial cells. Because S100beta and sCD14 concentrations correlate with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we suppose that the combination of both markers may be useful to obtain prognostic information in patients with ALS.",M2
20235485,"[Two cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with a SOD1L126S mutation showing high age at onset and slow progression]An 80-year-old man (patient 1) was admitted to our hospital with numbness of the right leg and weakness of the lower extremities, predominantly in the right leg, for 1 year previously. Neurological examination revealed moderate weakness without atrophy, and fasciculation in the bilateral lower extremities. No hyperreflexia was noted, and the plantar response was flexor. Neither bulbar palsy nor sensory disturbance was observed. Electromyography (EMG) showed a chronic neurogenic pattern, including giant motor unit potentials and reduced interference in all four limb muscles. MRI images of the cervical and lumbar spines showed severe age-related spondylosis. The clinical and laboratory findings led to a diagnosis of spinal progressive muscular atrophy. Motor paralysis progressed slowly for the following four years, culminating in respiratory failure. A 79-year-man, the younger brother of patient 1 (patient 2), suffered from gait disturbance for 3 years before the admission to our hospital. During the following 3 years, bilateral leg weakness developed, causing difficulty walking. Neurological examination revealed a diffuse mild weakness with atrophy and fasciculation in the bilateral lower extremities; the right deltoid muscle was also mildly weak. Mild hyperreflexia was also noted on the left side, and the plantar response was extensor on the left. EMG showed acute and chronic neurogenic patterns in the four limb muscles. Because the missense mutation c.377 T &gt; C; p.L126S was found on exon 5 of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 gene in this patient, a diagnosis of familial <e>ALS</e> was made. Eight patients reported as familial ALS with the SOD1L126S mutation, including the present cases, all developed an onset of weakness in the lower extremities, but showed few upper motor neuron signs. It is important to consider the possibility of this type of familial ALS in a case of spinal progressive muscular atrophy with late-onset and mild progression, if family history is positive.",M2
20232802,"Improving binding specificity of pharmacological chaperones that target mutant superoxide dismutase-1 linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using computational methods.We recently described a set of drug-like molecules obtained from an in silico screen that stabilize mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) against unfolding and aggregation but exhibited poor binding specificity toward SOD-1 in presence of blood plasma. A reasonable but not a conclusive model for the binding of these molecules was proposed on the basis of restricted docking calculations and site-directed mutagenesis of key residues at the dimer interface. A set of hydrogen bonding constraints obtained from these experiments were used to guide docking calculations with compound library around the dimer interface. A series of chemically unrelated hits were predicted, which were experimentally tested for their ability to block aggregation. At least six of the new molecules exhibited high specificity of binding toward SOD-1 in the presence of blood plasma. These molecules represent a new class of molecules for further development into clinical candidates.",M2
20227395,"Novel splice variants of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated gene VAPB expressed in human tissues.VAPB is a highly conserved integral membrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic organisms and located within the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The P56S missense mutation of the VAPB protein is linked to a hereditary form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS8), and the pathogenesis of ALS8 has remained enigmatic. We report the cloning of five novel splice variants of the human VAPB gene, all of which are expressed at the mRNA level in the human nervous system. When transfected into human HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells, two of these variants (VAPB-2 and VAPB-4,5) were readily detectable by immunoblotting whereas two variants (VAPB-3 and VAPB-3,4) became detectable after proteasomal inhibition, a condition commonly found in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, one of these novel VAPB variants, VAPB-2, co-immunoprecipitated with wt-VAPB. However, so far none of these splice variants could be detected by immunoblotting of lysates from selected human tissues, suggesting that in vivo, the proteins translated from the variant VAPB mRNAs are quickly degraded or, alternatively, the expressed proteins are below detection limit of the available antibodies. We speculate that under conditions of proteasomal inhibition, as encountered in many neurodegenerative diseases including <e>ALS</e>, variant VAPB proteins might accumulate in affected cells and contribute to ALS pathogenesis.",M2
20224486,"Respiratory failure in a 70-year-old veteran.In Western countries the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is 1.89 per 100,000 per year and the prevalence is 5.2 per 100,000. The incidence of ALS is lower among African, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicities when compared to Caucasians. The mean age of onset for sporadic ALS is about 60 years and there is a slight male predominance (male to female ratio of 1.5 to 1). Approximately two thirds of patients with ALS have the spinal form of the disease with symptoms presenting in the extremities. Patients typically have evidence of both lower motor neuron degeneration (atrophy, weakness, and fasciculations) and upper motor neuron degeneration (spasticity, weakness, and hyperreflexia). Patients with limb onset ALS typically complain of focal muscle weakness and wasting. The symptoms may start either distally or proximally in the upper and/or lower limbs. Gradually spasticity develops in the weakened atrophic limbs, affecting manual dexterity and gait. Patients with bulbar onset ALS typically present with dysarthria and dysphagia for solid or liquids. Limb symptoms can develop simultaneously with bulbar onset. In the vast majority of patients, limb weakness will occur within 1-2 years of bulbar onset ALS symptoms. A case of bulbar and sporadic limb ALS in a 70-year-old veteran, presenting with right diaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory failure, is presented.",M2
20202083,"DJ-1 forms complexes with mutant SOD1 and ameliorates its toxicity.Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), which could be attributed to the toxic properties of the misfolded protein, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. DJ-1 - a causative agent of familial Parkinson's disease PARK7 - is responsible for inducing antioxidative reaction. In this study, we showed the up-regulation of DJ-1 protein levels in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice through the lifespan were observed in the motor neurons. We demonstrated biochemically DJ-1 formed complexes with mutant SOD1 in the cell lysates. Furthermore, DJ-1 over-expression resulted in increased cell viability and reduced cell toxicity in mutant SOD1-transfected neuronal cells, because of improvement in apoptotic pathway and reduction in oxidative stress levels. We also evaluated DJ-1 levels in CSF collected from sporadic ALS patients and controls subjects. The CSF DJ-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with sporadic ALS than in control subjects. These results show that DJ-1 may be associated with sporadic and familial ALS pathogenesis. Therefore, insight into the effects of DJ-1 on mutant SOD1-mediated toxicity may provide a therapeutic advance for the treatment of motor neuron degeneration in ALS.",M2
20196488,"[Bulbar-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) with isolated agraphia]We reported the two cases with bulbar-onset ALS showing isolated agraphia without overt dementia and aphasia. Patient 1 was a 69-year-old man and patient 2 was an 81-year-old woman, and both were right-handed. Each patient developed dysarthria as an initial symptom followed by dysphagia, and neurological examinations showed atrophy and fasciculation of the tongue with upper and lower motor-neuron involvement of the extremities. These characteristic features with electromyographic evidence including widespread acute and chronic denervation led to a diagnosis of bulbar-onset ALS. Around 1 year after the onset of ALS, dysarthria was mild enough to allow oral communication enabling the determination that aphasia was absent with well preserved confrontation naming, repetition, reading and comprehension. The patients were polite without abnormal behavior or character change, and their general intelligence was also well preserved with excellent scores on the Mini Mental State Examination (30 and 27 points for patients 1 and 2, respectively) and Frontal Assessment Battery (16 points for each patient). However, spontaneous writing and dictation revealed abundant writing errors characterized by omission of kana letters and paragraphia of kana and kanji letters in both patients. Some syntactic errors were also observed in writing but in spoken language. A letter-number effect on writing errors was observed in patient 1. Copying of letters or words was intact and structure and orientation of written letters was well preserved, indicating the absence of constructional, apraxic or spatial feature of agraphia. Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated reduced uptake in the bilateral frontotemporal lobes, predominantly in the left hemisphere, with less evident alternation in magnetic resonance imaging. Our results suggest that patients with bulbar-onset ALS may develop isolated agraphia as a single-domain cognitive impairment, preceding the clinical manifestation of aphasia or dementia. We speculate that the main responsible region might be the posterior part of the middle and inferior frontal gyri including Exner's writing center and Broca's area beyond the primary motor cortex.",M2
20193532,"[Follow-up study of patients with chronic motor axonal neuropathy]OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristic of chronic motor axonal neuropathy and the prognosis of it. METHODS: 16 chronic motor axonal neuropathy (CMAN) patients were diagnosed by clinical manifestation and neurophysiologic manifestation. Follow-up study was done including living state, medicine they taken, change of physical sign and motor unit number estimation. 60 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were studies at the same time. The prognosis of these patients was compared. RESULTS: After being treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, the patients with CMAN showed a good clinical recovery except 6 patients who had the characteristic of <e>ALS</e> in the 18 months follow-up study, and the MUNE changed from 68 +/- 17 to 154 +/- 25. On the contrary, the patients with ALS had worse clinical manifestation, and the MUNE changed from 64 +/- 6 to 55 +/- 9. CONCLUSIONS: Immunological factor may be involved in the mechanism of chronic motor axonal neuropathy which has a better prognosis and is difficult to differentiate from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the earlier stage.",M2
20190699,"Statins and <e>ALS</e>: the possible role of impaired LXR signaling.Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, are commonly used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies suggest that statins may induce amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in some patients, but no pathogenic mechanism has been proposed for this association. Herein the hypothesis is proposed that statins may induce or aggravate ALS by impairing liver X receptor (LXR) signaling. The hypothesis is supported by the following observations: 1) statins inhibit the synthesis of endogenous LXR agonists, oxysterols, and decrease the expression of LXR target genes in many cells, 2) mice lacking LXRbeta exhibit sn ALS-like phenotype, 3) statins increase the concentration of plant sterols in plasma and tissues, partially by impairing LXR-dependent signaling, which results in augmented intestinal absorption and impaired biliary excretion of plant sterols, and 4) some plant sterols are toxic to motor neurons of the spinal cord, which are primarily affected in ALS patients. If this hypothesis is confirmed, LXR agonists could be used together with statins in patients predisposed to develop ALS or in those known to have the disorder to prevent motor neuron degeneration.",M2
20189984,"SOD1 mutations targeting surface hydrogen bonds promote amyotrophic lateral sclerosis without reducing apo-state stability.In good accord with the protein aggregation hypothesis for neurodegenerative diseases, <e>ALS</e>-associated SOD1 mutations are found to reduce structural stability or net repulsive charge. Moreover there are weak indications that the ALS disease progression rate is correlated with the degree of mutational impact on the apoSOD1 structure. A bottleneck for obtaining more conclusive information about these structure-disease relationships, however, is the large intrinsic variability in patient survival times and insufficient disease statistics for the majority of ALS-provoking mutations. As an alternative test of the structure-disease relationship we focus here on the SOD1 mutations that appear to be outliers in the data set. The results identify several ALS-provoking mutations whose only effect on apoSOD1 is the elimination or introduction of a single charge, i.e. D76V/Y, D101N, and N139D/K. The thermodynamic stability and folding behavior of these mutants are indistinguishable from the wild-type control. Moreover, D101N is an outlier in the plot of stability loss versus patient survival time by having rapid disease progression. Common to the identified mutations is that they truncate conserved salt-links and/or H-bond networks in the functional loops IV or VII. The results show that the local impact of ALS-associated mutations on the SOD1 molecule can sometimes overrun their global effects on apo-state stability and net repulsive charge, and point at the analysis of property outliers as an efficient strategy for mapping out new ALS-provoking features.",M2
20188146,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutant vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-B transgenic mice develop TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 pathology.Cytoplasmic ubiquitin-positive inclusions containing TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) within motor neurons are the hallmark pathology of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). TDP-43 is a nuclear protein and the mechanisms by which it becomes mislocalized and aggregated in ALS are not properly understood. A mutation in the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-B (VAPB) involving a proline to serine substitution at position 56 (VAPBP56S) is the cause of familial ALS type-8. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which VAPBP56S induces disease, we created transgenic mice that express either wild-type VAPB (VAPBwt) or VAPBP56S in the nervous system. Analyses of both sets of mice revealed no overt motor phenotype nor alterations in survival. However, VAPBP56S but not VAPBwt transgenic mice develop cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulations within spinal cord motor neurons that were first detected at 18 months of age. Our results suggest a link between abnormal VAPBP56S function and TDP-43 mislocalization.",M2
20184893,"Disulfide-reduced <e>ALS</e> variants of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase exhibit increased populations of unfolded species.Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a dimeric metal-binding enzyme responsible for the dismutation of toxic superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen in cells. Mutations at dozens of sites in SOD1 induce amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal gain-of-function neurodegenerative disease whose molecular basis is unknown. To obtain insights into effects of the mutations on the folded and unfolded populations of immature monomeric forms whose aggregation or self-association may be responsible for ALS, the thermodynamic and kinetic folding properties of a set of disulfide-reduced and disulfide-oxidized Zn-free and Zn-bound stable monomeric SOD1 variants were compared to properties of the wild-type (WT) protein. The most striking effect of the mutations on the monomer stability was observed for the disulfide-reduced metal-free variants. Whereas the WT and S134N monomers are &gt;95% folded at neutral pH and 37 degrees C, A4V, L38V, G93A, and L106V ranged from 50% to approximately 90% unfolded. The reduction of the disulfide bond was also found to reduce the apparent Zn affinity of the WT monomer by 750-fold, into the nanomolar range, where it may be unable to compete for free Zn in the cell. With the exception of the S134N metal-binding variant, the Zn affinity of disulfide-oxidized SOD1 monomers showed little sensitivity to amino acid replacements. These results suggest a model for SOD1 aggregation where the constant synthesis of ALS variants of SOD1 on ribosomes provides a pool of species in which the increased population of the unfolded state may favor aggregation over productive folding to the native dimeric state.",M2
20178658,"[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis en frontotemporal dementia: overlapping characteristics]There is an overlap between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Some 5-10% of ALS patients show changes in their behaviour and personality that are characteristic of FTD and about 10% of FTD patients develop ALS. Mild cognitive impairment occurs in 30% of ALS patients. The progressive decline of muscle strength in ALS patients and social skills in FTD patients places severe demands on the patient and his or her contacts. In some ALS and FTD patients, ubiquitin-positive inclusions have been found in the hippocampus and anterior horn cells. In patients with familial FTD who have ubiquitin-positive inclusions, mutations have been found in the progranulin (PGRN) gene. TAR-DNA-binding protein-43, encoded by the TARDBP gene, has recently been identified as a constituent of the ubiquitin inclusions. TARDBP and PGRN mutations are found in patients with ALS. The overlapping characteristics provide clues for further research into the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD.",M2

However, the human phenotype of the G93A SOD1 mutation-the most commonly studied mutation in rodent models-has remained essentially unknown. This complicates the interpretation and transfer of results from animal models. Here clinical, electrophysiological and genealogical data are presented from a large German pedigree with a G93A mutation in the SOD1 gene. This pedigree shows a highly homogenous phenotype which closely resembles the typical phenotype of sporadic ALS, thus implicating comparable disease pathology of G93A SOD1 ALS and sporadic ALS.",M2
20172742,"Radiologic versus endoscopic placement of percutaneous gastrostomy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: multivariate analysis of tolerance, efficacy, and survival.PURPOSE: To compare percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in terms of tolerance, efficacy, and survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with ALS (17 men; mean age, 66.1 years; range, 39-83 y) underwent 21 PEG and 22 PRG attempts (including three unsuccessful PEG attempts) from 1999 to 2005. To assess tolerance and efficacy, a successful and well tolerated placement was defined as any successful placement with no major or minor local complications or pain requiring opioid analgesic agents. Univariate analysis was performed for all recorded parameters, followed by multivariate analysis for successful and well tolerated placement, 6-month mortality rate, and survival. RESULTS: General success rates were 85.7% for PEG and 100% for PRG. Pain was more frequent in PRGs (81.8% vs 52.4%; P = .05). Successful and well tolerated placement was seen in 81.8% of PRGs and 57.1% of PEGs (P = 0.1). Advanced age (P = .02) and PRG (P = .07) were predictive of successful and well tolerated placement. The interval from diagnosis to placement (P = .001) and ability to perform spirometry (P = .002) were predictive of survival. Oximetry measurements (P = .007) and interval from diagnosis to placement (P = .02) were predictive of mortality at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: PRG is more efficacious and better tolerated than PEG, essentially because it avoids the respiratory decompensation that may occur in PEG. Therefore, PRG should be preferred in cases of ALS. Survival is linked to ALS evolution and not to the choice of PRG or PEG placement.",M2
20170712,"Exposure to CSF from sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients induces morphological transformation of astroglia and enhances GFAP and S100beta expression.We have earlier shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) patients' produces selective degeneration of motor neurons, both in vitro as well as in vivo. The present study further evaluates the effect of ALS-CSF on the astrocytes in embryonic rat spinal cord cultures. We quantified the number of flat and process-bearing astrocytes in spinal cord cultures exposed to ALS-CSF and compared them against controls. In addition, GFAP and S100beta expression were quantified by Western blot and measurement of immunofluorescence intensity respectively. We found higher number of process-bearing astrocytes in the cultures exposed to ALS-CSF. Both these proteins increased significantly in cultures exposed to ALS-CSF. Our results provide evidence that astroglia respond to toxic factor(s) present in ALS-CSF by undergoing morphological transformation from flat to process bearing which is further confirmed by elevated expression of GFAP and S100beta. The above changes could possibly alter the microenvironment hastening the motor neuron degeneration.",M2

METHODS: A descriptive survey research design aimed to obtain quantitative data and open-ended responses from an active physician at each of the 15 multidisciplinary Canadian ALS centres. RESULTS: The principal findings of this study were: 1) NIPPV and TV are used in 18.3% and 1.5% of patients at Canadian ALS centres, respectively, 2) symptoms of respiratory insufficiency, namely orthopnea (clinical significance rated at 9.00/10 +/- 1.48), dyspnea (8.27 +/- 1.95) and morning headache (7.55 +/- 1.21) are the most significant indicators for NIPPV initiation, 3) the primary barriers to NIPPV utilization are patient intolerance (70% of centres) and inaccessibility of respirologists and ventilation technologists (50% of centres). CONCLUSIONS: Variability in NIPPV use has an impact upon the management of Canadian ALS patients. The establishment of more definitive NIPPV initiation criteria, emphasizing respiratory symptoms, and the attenuation of barriers to NIPPV use should be targeted so as to ensure optimal care for all ALS patients.",M2

RNS with up to 100 supramaximal stimuli was given to the median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves of normal subjects and the ulnar nerves of subjects with early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), recording evoked compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). In all nerves, there was a decline in the CMAP area and a decrease in CMAP duration. For the peroneal nerve there was a decline in the CMAP amplitude, but a similar decline was not seen in the median or ulnar nerves. Cooling of the muscles resulted in decrement of both the amplitude and area with RNS. In ALS subjects, CMAP amplitude and area both declined after RNS of the ulnar nerve. In this study we describe the changes in CMAP with prolonged RNS among commonly tested normal nerves. Our findings have important implications with regard to RNS.",M2

METHODS: 35 patients and their next of kin were studied using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), Schedule for Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and patients also by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised and the Norris scale every fourth to sixth month, one to four times. RESULTS: Changes were found over time in both patients and their next of kin in the SF-36 but not in the SEIQoL-DW or HADS. Patients rated worse than their next of kin in the SF-36 physical subscales and next of kin rated worse than the patients in the global QoL score in SEIQoL-DW. Health, hobbies, and total relations were important areas in the SEIQoL-DW among all participants, but some important areas also differed between the patients and their next of kin. In most important areas among the pairs, the next of kin estimated their functioning/satisfaction worse than patients estimated their functioning/satisfaction. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: There were few changes over time in the QoL among the participants. Although most of the estimates in patients and their next of kin were equal, there were also some differences. These results emphasize the importance of support for both patients and their next of kin and that support ought to be given on both individual bases and together in pairs. The SEIQoL-DW might give signposts in the care through the course of the disease about what should be focused on to increase satisfaction of the important areas of life and might help the person to find coping strategies to handle his or her life situation.",M2

DESIGN: Internally generated questionnaire. SETTING: An ALS/Muscular Dystrophy Association center. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of current patients (N=45) of our clinic with ALS/MND who are PWC users (men, n=27; women, n=18; age range, 27-85 y). INTERVENTION: Self-administered survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Thirty-two patients completed a 31-question survey investigating patients' patterns of selection, satisfaction, and frequency of PWC use; technical and psychometric influences; and other aspects of decision-making processes that patients experience before, during, and after acquiring a PWC. RESULTS: Ninety percent of respondents received their evaluations at a multidisciplinary ALS clinic, 1 via the Department of Veterans Affairs, and 1 was unknown. Sixty-six percent of patients thought the chair evaluation was timed correctly, and 19% wished they had started sooner. Forty-five percent of people were able to walk a few steps, and 55% were able to stand when their chairs arrived. When they first received the chair, 79% were satisfied with the overall comfort of the chair, and 86% were satisfied with the ease of use; currently, 69% are satisfied with the overall comfort, and 72% are satisfied with ease of use. There was a statistically significant difference in how patients used their wheelchair features initially and currently in terms of seat elevate and attendant control, but not tilt, recline, and elevating leg rests. The average cost for the power chairs was $26,404 (range, $19,376-$34,311), and the average cost a month is $917. Overall, 88% of respondents said they would get the same type of chair with the same features again, and 81% felt that the chair was a good value for the cost. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained first-hand knowledge from 32 patients with ALS/MND who are current PWC users on their use and satisfaction with their PWCs from initial to current use. Based on this survey, patients with ALS/MND seen for their wheelchair evaluation with experienced clinicians exhibit high use and satisfaction with their PWCs.",M2

Weakness initially affected the bulbar musculature, with later involvement of the extremities. Genetic studies failed to detect any mutations of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and Dynactin1 (DCTN1) genes, but revealed a single base pair change from wild-type adenine to guanine at position 1009 in TAR-DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), resulting in a methionine-to-valine substitution at position 337. The immunohistochemical study on autopsied brain of the proband's aunt showed TDP-43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and in the hypoglossal nucleus, as well as glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the precentral gyrus, suggesting that a neuroglial proteinopathy was related to TDP-43. In conclusion, a characteristic clinical phenotype of familial ALS with initial bulbar symptoms occurred in this family with TDP-43 M337V substitution, the pathomechanism of which should be elucidated.",M2
20154090,"Ubiquilin modifies TDP-43 toxicity in a Drosophila model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>).TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) is a major constituent of ubiquitin-positive cytosolic aggregates present in neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ubiquitin-positive fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U). Inherited mutations in TDP-43 have been linked to familial forms of ALS, indicating a key role for TDP-43 in disease pathogenesis. Here, we describe a Drosophila melanogaster model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Expression of wild-type human TDP-43 protein in Drosophila motor neurons led to motor dysfunction and dramatic reduction of life span. Interestingly, coexpression of ubiquilin 1, a previously identified TDP-43-interacting protein with suspected functions in autophagy and proteasome targeting, reduced steady-state TDP-43 expression but enhanced the severity of TDP-43 phenotypes. Finally, ectopically expressed TDP-43 was largely localized to motor neuron nuclei, suggesting that expression of wild-type TDP-43 alone is detrimental even in the absence of cytosolic aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that TDP-43 exerts cell-autonomous neurotoxicity in Drosophila and further imply that dose-dependent alterations of TDP-43 nuclear function may underlie motor neuron death in ALS.",M2

Our study has been performed along 72 months by grouping the patients according to the <e>ALS</e> functional rating score or rate of disease progression. Our results showed a significant impairment of erythrocytes glutathione peroxidase activity in all groups of patients that remained low during disease time course. SOD1 activity significantly decreased along disease course in subjects with a more impaired functional status.

By this work we have the evidence that different ALS phenotypes present with different profile of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant response.",M2
20152807,"Human adipose-derived stem cells enhance the glutamate uptake function of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes.Impaired glutamate uptake function of astrocytes associated with accumulation of extracellular glutamate is a well-documented feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). Enhancing the uptake function of astrocytic glutamate transport 1 (GLT1) may be a potential treatment for this disease. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are capable of secreting a large number of cytokines which exhibit diverse pharmacological effects. Therefore, we investigate the influence of the soluble factors released by hADSCs on the GLT1 in primary astrocytes cultured from SOD1(G93A) mice, a widely studied mutant human SOD1 transgenic model of ALS. Our data indicate that soluble factors from hADSCs significantly upregulate the expression of GLT1 in SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes, which result in enhanced glutamate uptake function. The upregulation of GLT1 is accompanied by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation in mutant astrocytes. In addition, we find that hADSCs cocultured with SOD1(G93A)-bearing astrocytes produce more VEGF, HGF and IGF-1, which are reported to have neuroprotective effects. Our results suggest that hADSCs may be a potential candidate in cellular therapy for ALS.",M2

Non-invasive BIPAP-ventilation has proven to be helpful to cope with the increasing hypoventilation due to weakness in ventilatory muscles in ALS. If BIPAP-ventilation is well tolerated by the patient, it can be very helpful for symptom control in palliative homecare. In this case presentation we discuss how non-invasive ventilation can influence perception of dying at home and thereby quality of life of patients, caregivers and members of palliative teams. We will see that especially during this sensible terminal phase various questions and fears concerning the mechanically assisted ventilation may arise. These issues should be addressed in advance with careful attention and information. Members of palliative teams should therefore be provided with good training and regular supervision.",M2

The presence of such a relationship would indicate a possible role for ASL perfusion as a marker of disease severity and upper motor neuron involvement in ALS. METHODS: Disease severity was assessed in 16 subjects with ALS (age 54 +/- 11) using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) and the pulmonary function measure, forced vital capacity (FVC). Upper motor neuron involvement was assessed by testing rapid tapping of the fingers and feet. Magnetic resonance perfusion images were coregistered with structural T1-weighted MRI, corrected for partial volume effects using the structural images and normalized to a study-specific atlas. Correlations between perfusion and ALS disease severity were analyzed, using statistical parametric mapping, and including age as a factor. Analyses were adjusted for multiple clusters. Result: ALS severity, as measured by the ALSFRS and FVC, was correlated with gray matter perfusion. This correlation was predominantly observed in the hemisphere contralateral to the more affected limbs. ALSFRS scores correlated with perfusion in the contralateral frontal and parietal lobe (p &lt; 0.001) and ipsilateral frontal lobe (p &lt; 0.02). FVC scores correlated with gray matter perfusion in contralateral frontal lobe (p &lt; 0.001). Upper motor neuron involvement, as measured by rapid finger tapping, correlated bilaterally with perfusion in the middle cingulate gyrus (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severity is correlated with brain perfusion as measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion. This correlation appears to be independent of brain atrophy. ASL perfusion may be a useful tool for monitoring disease progression and assessing treatment effects in ALS.",M2
20138122,"P-glycoprotein expression and function are increased in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The efflux pumps located at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevent drugs entering the brain. As such, efflux pumps are a major obstacle to drug brain distribution. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with little therapeutics available: riluzole is the only drug approved in its treatment. The lack of response to treatment in ALS may be, at least in part, due to increased activities of efflux pumps in relation to disease, leading to subtherapeutic brain concentrations of drugs. In the present study, we used a transgenic mouse model of ALS (G86R mSOD1 mice) to test this hypothesis. Expression and functionality of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2, BCRP), two major efflux pumps, were studied. We observed an increased P-gp expression (1.5-fold) in presymptomatic mSOD1 mice compared to wild-type controls. Consistent with this, P-gp function was also increased by 1.5-fold and riluzole brain disposition was decreased by 1.7-fold in mSOD1 mice. Contrasting with this, BCRP expression and function were unaltered by the pathology. These results demonstrate that BBB transport proteins are modified in G86R mSOD1 mice ALS model. Such findings underline potential problems in extrapolating the results of animal studies to humans and developing clinical trials, especially for drugs transported by P-gp.",M2
20137632,"[Comparison of multiple point stimulation and incremental stimulation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]OBJECTIVE: To compare two common techniques for motor unit number estimation (MUNE), multiple point stimulation and incremental stimulation to determine which is preferable in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>). METHODS: Surface recorded motor unit action potentials of median nerve or thenar muscle were measured in 60 ALS patients and 60 controls. The maximal baseline to negative peak compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude was recorded. For multiple point stimulation, the stimuli sites included the skin of wrist, 6 cm above the wrist, elbow and 6 cm above the elbow. Individual motor unit responses were obtained by moving the stimulating electrode and isolating threshold responses with distinct morphologies. Then, with finely graded stimulus intensity at one point, 3 steps in a CMAP were investigated. 10 - 12 different single motor unit action potentials (SMUPs) were recorded. For incremental stimulation, stimulus intensity was slowly increased from subthreshold levels until a small all-or-none response was evoked. The intensity was slowly increased until the response increased in a quantal fashion. This process was repeated for a total of 10 increments. Individual motor unit amplitudes were obtained by subtracting amplitudes of each response from that of prior response. Both techniques were performed twice, electrodes changed and results averaged. RESULTS: For controls, MUNE was 228 +/- 30 for multiple point stimulation and 198 +/- 26 for incremental stimulation. Test-retest correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation for mean of two MUNE were 0.88 - 0.91 and 13.20% - 15.24% for multiple point stimulation, 0.86 and 13.30% - 15.65% for incremental stimulation. For ALS patients, MUNE was 64 +/- 6 and 59 +/- 7 respectively. CONCLUSION: Both MUNE methods are similarly reproducible and are equally effective at documenting progression of a lower motor neuron disorder in ALS patients.",M2
20137488,"Association between DPP6 polymorphism and the risk of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Chinese patients.BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex, which results in muscle weakness, atrophy. Sporadic ALS (SALS) accounts for about 90% of ALS cases, but the etiology is largely unknown. Most of the researchers consider it to be a complex disease. There have been several genome-wide association (GWA) studies reporting several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are susceptible to ALS, but no data of Asians (including Chinese) yet. We investigate whether the polymorphism of rs10260404 in DPP6 gene is associated with SALS in Chinese Han origin to compare the ethnic differences between Chinese Han origin and other populations. METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes of whole blood samples in 58 Chinese Han patients with SALS and 52 healthy controls. The asymmetric PCR was processed in the presence of an unlabeled probe that contained the rs10260404 locus. The product was genotyped on a light scanner using high resolution melting method and some were confirmed with sequencing. RESULTS: The rs10260404 polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls. The CC genotype and the C allele were similar in patients compared with healthy subjects and not associated with an increased risk of Chinese SALS patients (chi(2) = 0.29, OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.55 - 2.87, P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The rs10260404 is not associated with ALS susceptibility in Chinese people with Han origin which may be due to ethnic differences. More study with large number of cases in Chinese population is really necessary.",M2
20137433,"[Revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale at time of diagnosis predicts survival time in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]OBJECTIVE: To identify the correlation between the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and the progression rate of ALSFRS-R (DeltaFS) at time of diagnosis and survival time in a prospective survey. METHODS: A total of 129 consecutive patents with definite or probable ALS were enrolled at our hospital from January 2002 to December 2005. The patients were monitored with a standard evaluation form recording clinical features, ALSFRS-R and forced vital capacity (FVC) every 3 months from visit to death or tracheostomy. RESULTS: The mean age at onset was (52 +/- 11) years old. The median survival time from symptom onset was 45.71 months (95% CI = 35 to 51). In univariate analysis of Kaplan-Meier method, the outcome was significantly related to total ALSFRS-R and DeltaFS (P &lt; 0.05). In Cox multivariate model, DeltaFS and FVC% were both statistically significant predictors of survival after adjusting for age and onset site (P &lt; 0.05). Al-unit decrease in DeltaFS was associated with a 73.3% decreased risk of death. CONCLUSION: ALSFRS-R is sensitive to the change over time and can predict survival at diagnosis. It can be used as a primary outcome measure in ALS clinical trial. DeltaFS at diagnosis can provide us the information of disease progression at one particular point. It is a more significant predictor of survival in patients with ALS as compared to total ALSFRS-R and time from onset to diagnosis.",M2
20133711,"TDP-43 transgenic mice develop spastic paralysis and neuronal inclusions characteristic of <e>ALS</e> and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.Neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear aggregates of RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are a hallmark feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). ALS and FTLD show a considerable clinical and pathological overlap and occur as both familial and sporadic forms. Though missense mutations in TDP-43 cause rare forms of familial ALS, it is not yet known whether this is due to loss of TDP-43 function or gain of aberrant function. Moreover, the role of wild-type (WT) TDP-43, associated with the majority of familial and sporadic ALS/FTLD patients, is also currently unknown. Generating homozygous and hemizygous WT human TDP-43 transgenic mouse lines, we show here a dose-dependent degeneration of cortical and spinal motor neurons and development of spastic quadriplegia reminiscent of ALS. A dose-dependent degeneration of nonmotor cortical and subcortical neurons characteristic of FTLD was also observed. Neurons in the affected spinal cord and brain regions showed accumulation of TDP-43 nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that were both ubiquitinated and phosphorylated as observed in ALS/FTLD patients. Moreover, the characteristic approximately 25-kDa C-terminal fragments (CTFs) were also recovered from nuclear fractions and correlated with disease development and progression in WT TDP-43 mice. These findings suggest that approximately 25-kDa TDP-43 CTFs are noxious to neurons by a gain of aberrant nuclear function.",M2
20132483,"Mutant SOD1 knockdown in all cell types ameliorates disease in G85R SOD1 mice with a limited additional effect over knockdown restricted to motor neurons.Approximately 10% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) have familial ALS (FALS), and 20% of FALS is caused by mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase type 1 (MTSOD1). Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated that MTSOD1 expression in other cell types besides motor neurons (MNs) contributes to disease in MTSOD1 FALS transgenic mice. Using Cre/LoxP methods, we knocked down G85R SOD1 mRNA by 66% in all cell types in 3-month-old FALS transgenic mice, delaying disease onset and lengthening disease duration. Surprisingly, the effect on onset and early disease duration was similar to that seen in FALS transgenic mice with approximately 25% knockdown prenatally in G85R SOD1 mRNA restricted to MNs and some interneurons. These results demonstrate no clear cumulative effect on disease onset or early disease duration from knocking down G85R SOD1 in other cell types in addition to MNs/interneurons; the findings bring up the possibility that MTSOD1 has a pathogenic effect early in life that our later knockdown did not affect. Despite the more limited amelioration of disease than expected, the effect of the knockdown on disease supports the value of this approach in FALS patients and asymptomatic individuals with SOD1 mutations.",M2
20132478,"In vitro activation of GAT1 transporters expressed in spinal cord gliosomes stimulates glutamate release that is abnormally elevated in the SOD1/G93A(+) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.The effect of GABA on glutamate release from astrocytes has been studied in healthy mice and in a murine transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), using mouse spinal cord gliosomes labeled with [(3)H]d-aspartate ([(3)H]d-ASP). GABA concentration-dependently evoked the release of [(3)H]d-ASP. The effect of GABA was not mimicked by GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptor agonists or counteracted by antagonists, excluding receptor involvement. However, it was prevented by the GABA transport inhibitor N-(4,4-phenyl-3-butenyl)-nipecotic acid (SKF 89976A), suggesting participation of GABA transporters type 1 (GAT1) placed on glutamate-releasing astrocyte-derived gliosomes. Accordingly, GAT1 co-expressed with glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter type 1 (GLT1) in the majority of glial particles. [(3)H]d-aspartate release was Ca(2+)-independent and not blocked by the glutamate uptake inhibitor dl-threo-b-benzyloxyaspartic acid (dl-TBOA); instead, it was abrogated by the anion channel blockers niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB). The GAT1-mediated release of [(3)H]d-ASP was significantly enhanced in spinal cord gliosomes from the mouse model of ALS. This excessive [(3)H]d-ASP release was very precocious, largely preceding the onset of the disease symptoms. These data indicate that GAT1, GLAST and GLT1 coexist on the same gliosome in mouse spinal cord and that activation of GAT1 transporters elicits glutamate release by anion channel opening. This phenomenon might have pathological relevance, because [(3)H]d-ASP release is enhanced in experimental ALS.",M2
20129626,"Association of <e>ALS</e> with head injury, cigarette smoking and APOE genotypes.OBJECTIVE: An increased risk of ALS has been reported for US veterans, but the cause is unknown. Since head injury and cigarette smoking are two previously implicated environmental risk factors that are more common in military than civilian study populations, we tested their association with ALS in a US veteran study population. METHODS: We used logistic regression to examine the association of ALS with head injury and cigarette smoking in 241 incident cases and 597 controls. Since APOE is a plausible ALS candidate gene, we also tested its main effect and its statistical interaction with these environmental exposures. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking was not associated with ALS in this predominantly male and Caucasian population. Veterans who had experienced head injuries during the last 15years before the reference date had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.33 (95% confidence interval 1.18-4.61), relative to veterans without any head injuries. This association was strongest in APOE-4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the body of evidence suggesting that head injuries may be a risk factor for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. We hypothesize that the strength of association between head injuries and ALS may depend upon APOE genotype.",M2
20124201,"Genetic contribution of FUS to frontotemporal lobar degeneration.BACKGROUND: Recently, the FUS gene was identified as a new causal gene for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) in approximately 4% of patients with familial ALS. Since ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are part of a clinical, pathologic, and genetic disease spectrum, we investigated a potential role of FUS in FTLD. METHODS: We performed mutational analysis of FUS in 122 patients with FTLD and 15 patients with FTLD-ALS, as well as in 47 patients with ALS. Mutation screening was performed by sequencing of PCR amplicons of the 15 FUS exons. RESULTS: We identified 1 patient with FTLD with a novel missense mutation, M254V, that was absent in 638 control individuals. In silico analysis predicted this amino acid substitution to be pathogenic. The patient did not have a proven family history of neurodegenerative brain disease. Further, we observed the known R521H mutation in 1 patient with ALS. No FUS mutations were detected in the patients with FTLD-ALS. While insertions/deletions of 2 glycines (G) were suggested to be pathogenic in the initial FUS reports, we observed an identical GG-deletion in 2 healthy individuals and similar G-insertions/deletions in 4 other control individuals, suggesting that G-insertions/deletions within this G-rich region may be tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In a first analysis of FUS in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), we identified a novel FUS missense mutation, M254V, in 1 patient with pure FTLD. At this point, the biologic relevance of this mutation remains elusive. Screening of additional FTLD patient cohorts will be needed to further elucidate the contribution of FUS mutations to FTLD pathogenesis.",M2
20118741,"Longitudinal monitoring of motor neuron circuitry in FALS rats using in-vivo phMRI.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) presents challenges for diagnosis and objective monitoring of disease progression. We show, using pharmacologic MRI, that alterations in motor circuitry can be characterized using a passive stimulus in a rat model of familial ALS as a function of symptom progression. Presymptomatic familial ALS rats had a pattern of activation to amphetamine that was statistically indistinguishable from the wild-type controls. In contrast, symptomatic rats showed significantly decreased response in sensorimotor cortex and increased response in M2 motor cortex, caudate/putamen, and thalamus. These results are similar to findings in humans of altered response to motor tasks in ALS. It may be plausible to use a passive amphetamine challenge as a biomarker to assess progression of the disease and efficacy of potential treatments.",M2
20117845,"A highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for the neurofilament heavy chain protein.BACKGROUND: The loss of neurological function is closely related to axonal damage. Neurofilament subunits are concentrated in neurons and axons and have emerged as promising biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) based assays are known to be of superior sensitivity and require less sample volume than conventional ELISAs. METHODS: We developed an ECL based solid-phase sandwich immunoassay to measure the neurofilament heavy chain protein (NfH(SMI35)) in CSF. We employed commercially available antibodies as previously used in a conventional ELISA (Petzold et al., 2003; Petzold and Shaw, 2007). The optimised and validated assay was applied in a reference cohort and defined patient groups. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity (background plus three SD) of our assay was 2.4 pg/ml. The mean intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 4.8% and the inter-assay CV 8.4%. All measured control and patient samples produced signals well above background. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (median 46.2 pg/ml, n=95), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) (160.1 pg/ml, n=50), mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease (MCI/AD) (65.6 pg/ml, n=20), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (91.0 pg/ml, n=20) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (345.0 pg/ml, n=20) had higher CSF NfH(SMI35) values than the reference cohort (27.1 pg/ml, n=73, p&lt;0.0001 for each comparison). CONCLUSION: The new ECL based assay for NfH(SMI35) in CSF is superior in terms of sensitivity, precision and accuracy to previously published methods (Petzold et al., 2003; Shaw et al., 2005; Teunissen et al., 2009). The improved performance and small sample volume requirement qualify this method in experimental settings and clinical trials designed to perform a number of tests on limited amounts of material.",M2
20117176,"Selection of optimal passage of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for stem cell therapy in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from bone marrow (BM) are currently used as an alternative therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) patients. Selection of optimal passages of autologous BM-derived MSCs during long-term in vitro expansion is important for clinical trials in patients with ALS. We isolated and expanded MSCs from the BM of eight ALS patients to analyze the growth kinetics, differentiation potential, cellular surface antigen expression, karyotype modifications and secretion of various cytokines during long-term culture. The morphology and size of the cells changed from small and spindle-like cells to large and polygonal types in later passages. The growth rate of the MSCs was highest in the third passage, followed by a gradual decrease. There were no special modifications of cell surface antigens or the karyotype of the MSCs from the first to the tenth passage. MSCs in the fourth passage were differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. When we analyzed the cultured media of MSCs at the third, fifth, seventh and ninth passages, IL-6, VEGF and IL-8 showed high expression, with more than 50pg/10,000 cells at these passages; however, their expression progressively decreased with additional passages. In addition, secretion of IL-15, GM-CSF, IL-10, PDGF-bb, G-CSF, IL-1beta, basic FGF and IFN-gamma gradually decreased over prolonged culture. We suggest that MSCs at earlier passages are more suitable for stem cell therapy in ALS patients because of their stability and more potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.",M2
20116097,"Calcium dysregulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.In the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), motor neurons degenerate with signs of organelle fragmentation, free radical damage, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, impaired axonal transport and accumulation of proteins in intracellular inclusion bodies. Subgroups of motor neurons of the brainstem and the spinal cord expressing low amounts of Ca2+ buffering proteins are particularly vulnerable. In ALS, chronic excitotoxicity mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPA type glutamate receptors seems to initiate a self-perpetuating process of intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation with consecutive endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ depletion and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The only known effective treatment, riluzole, seems to reduce glutamatergic input. This review introduces the hypothesis of a  toxic shift of Ca2+  within the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria Ca2+ cycle (ERMCC) as a key mechanism in motor neuron degeneration, and discusses molecular targets which may be of interest for future ERMCC modulating neuroprotective therapies.",M2
20112794,"[Changes in the incidence and clinical features of <e>ALS</e> in the Koza, Kozagawa, and Kushimoto area of the Kii Peninsula--from the 1960s to the 2000s (follow-up study)]In the 1960's, ALS was highly prevalent in the southern part of the Kii Peninsula, especially in the Koza, Kozagawa, and Kushimoto area (K area). Thereafter, the incidence of ALS was considered to have gradually decreased, and the disease almost disappeared in the 1980's. However, new patients have been continuously identified in this area, and indicating the importance of studying the changes in the incidences of ALS. This study investigated the characteristic clinical features and incidence of ALS in K area during the following periods: period I: between 1967 and 1971, period II: between 1989 and 1999, and period III: between 2000 and 2008. Data on all patients with motor neuron disease were collected for each year within these periods from medical doctors and medical staff of the regional public health center and municipal office. Neurologists on our research team examined and assessed each of these patients on the basis of the El Escorial criteria. Probable and definite ALS patients diagnosed by neurologists using the El Escorial criteria in K area during the research periods were collected. The crude incidence rate of ALS in K area were similar in period I, i.e. 6.0/100,000, and in period III, i.e., 5.7/100,000. The age-, and sex-adjusted incidence (considering the 2000 census) in women in K area during period III, especially in Kozagawa district, was higher than that in periods I and II. The adjusted incidence rate in Kozagawa district was 8.8/100,000, and was higher than that in other areas of the world. The clinical features of patients in this area were quite similar to those of patients with classical ALS. Five patients from 3 families with a family history of ALS and 2 patients without a family history presented with the clinical features of ALS and PDC during these research periods. The mean age at onset for period III was higher than that in period I (p &lt; 0.01). The frequency of ALS patients with upper-extremity onset in period III was lower than that in period I (p = 0.05), whereas the frequency of patients with bulbar-onset has recently increased. Conclusion The result of present study indicate that the recent incidence of ALS in K area is high, the age of onset has recently become higher and the number of bulbar-onset patients has increased. All the abovementioned findings could be attributed to an increase in the senility rate in the population. Between 2000 and 2008, the age-adjusted incidence in ALS for women in K area, especially in the Kozagawa district, was high, indicating an increase in that the incidence of ALS among women in this area after 2000. The factors responsible for the high incidence of ALS in this area remain to be clarified.",M2
20109233,"Progressive changes in microglia and macrophages in spinal cord and peripheral nerve in the transgenic rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.BACKGROUND: The role of neuroinflammation in motor neuron death of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is unclear. The human mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (hmSOD1)-expressing murine transgenic model of ALS has provided some insight into changes in microglia activity during disease progression. The purpose of this study was to gain further knowledge by characterizing the immunological changes during disease progression in the spinal cord and peripheral nerve using the more recently developed hmSOD1 rat transgenic model of ALS. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, the extent and intensity of tissue CD11b expression in spinal cord, lumbar nerve roots, and sciatic nerve were evaluated in hmSOD1 rats that were pre-clinical, at clinical onset, and near disease end-stage. Changes in CD11b expression were compared to the detection of MHC class II and CD68 microglial activation markers in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, as well as to the changes in astrocytic GFAP expression. RESULTS: Our study reveals an accumulation of microglia/macrophages both in the spinal cord and peripheral nerve prior to clinical onset based on CD11b tissue expression. The microglia formed focal aggregates in the ventral horn and became more widespread as the disease progressed. Hypertrophic astrocytes were not prominent in the ventral horn until after clinical onset, and the enhancement of GFAP did not have a strong correlation to increased CD11b expression. Detection of MHC class II and CD68 expression was found in the ventral horn only after clinical onset. The macrophages in the ventral nerve root and sciatic nerve of hmSOD1 rats were observed encircling axons. CONCLUSIONS: These findings describe for the first time in the hmSOD1 rat transgenic model of ALS that enhancement of microglia/macrophage activity occurs pre-clinically both in the peripheral nerve and in the spinal cord. CD11b expression is shown to be a superior indicator for early immunological changes compared to other microglia activation markers and astrogliosis. Furthermore, we suggest that the early activity of microglia/macrophages is involved in the early phase of motor neuron degeneration and propose that studies involving immunomodulation in hmSOD1transgenic models need to consider effects on macrophages in peripheral nerves as well as to microglia in the spinal cord.",M2
20099342,"Study of the features of proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.PURPOSE: To study the features of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) and its relation with clinical scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with definite or probable ALS and 15 age- and gender-matched normal controls were enrolled. (1)H-MRS was performed on a 3.0 Tesla GE imaging system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). TE-averaged Point Resolved Selective Spectroscopy was used. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), Glu, and Glx (glutamate + glutamine) values of the motor cortex and posterior limb of internal capsule were acquired. The t-test was used to compare differences between groups, and the correlations between the above values and clinical scale were analyzed. RESULTS: The motor area and posterior limb of the internal capsule of ALS patients had lower NAA/Cr (1.91 +/- 0.34, 1.53 +/- 0.17) compared with normal subjects (2.23 +/- 0.33, 1.66 +/- 0.07), and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01, 0.01). ALS patients had higher Glu/Cr (0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.29 +/- 0.06) and Glx/Cr (0.40 +/- 0.04, 0.33 +/- 0.06) compared with normal subjects (0.30 +/- 0.03, 0.25 +/- 0.04) and (0.32 +/- 0.05, 0.26 +/- 0.03), and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01, 0.01). The Norris scale was negatively correlated with Glx/Cr of primary motor cortex by lineal correlation analysis (r = -0.75), and this correlation had statistical significance (F = 16.60; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neuronal loss and Glu+Gln increase can be detected by using proton MRS in ALS patients. (1)H-MRS is an useful tool in reflecting the characteristic changes of metabolite in ALS.",M2
20097285,"Increased SOD1 association with chromatin, DNA damage, p53 activation, and apoptosis in a cellular model of SOD1-linked <e>ALS</e>.Mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). However the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron death are multi-factorial and remain unclear. Here we examined DNA damage, p53 activity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to achieve low-level expression of either wild-type or mutant Gly(93)--&gt;Ala (G93A) SOD1, typical of FALS. DNA damage was investigated by evaluating the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) and DNA strand breaks. Significantly higher levels of DNA damage, increased p53 activity, and a greater percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with G93A SOD1 when compared to cells overexpressing wild-type SOD1 and untransfected cells. Western blot, FACS, and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that G93A SOD1 is present in the nucleus in association with DNA. Nuclear G93A SOD1 has identical superoxide dismutase activity but displays increased peroxidase activity when compared to wild-type SOD1. These results indicate that the G93A mutant SOD1 association with DNA might induce DNA damage and trigger the apoptotic response by activating p53. This toxic activity of mutant SOD1 in the nucleus may play an important role in the complex mechanisms associated with motor neuron death observed in ALS pathogenesis.",M2
20097271,"Pigmented creatine deposits in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis central nervous system tissues identified by synchrotron Fourier Transform Infrared microspectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy.Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is an untreatable, neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons characterized by progressive muscle atrophy, limb paralysis, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnae and finally death. Large motor neurons in ventral horns of spinal cord and motor nuclei in brainstem, large pyramidal neurons of motor cortex and/or large myelinated axons of corticospinal tracts are affected. In recent synchrotron Fourier Transform Infrared microspectroscopy (sFTIR) studies of ALS CNS autopsy tissue, we discovered a small deposit of crystalline creatine, which has a crucial role in energy metabolism. We have now examined unfixed, snap frozen, post-autopsy tissue sections of motor cortex, brain stem, spinal cord, hippocampus and substantia nigra from six ALS and three non-degenerated cases with FTIR and micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Heterogeneous pigmented deposits were discovered in spinal cord, brain stem and motor neuron cortex of two ALS cases. The FTIR signature of creatine has been identified in these deposits and in numerous large, non-pigmented deposits in four of the ALS cases. Comparable pigmentation and creatine deposits were not found in controls or in ALS hippocampus and substantia nigra. Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Zn, as determined by XRF, were not correlated with the pigmented deposits; however, there was a higher incidence of hot spots (Ca, Zn, Fe and Cu) in the ALS cases. The identity of the pigmented deposits remains unknown, although the absence of Fe argues against both erythrocytes and neuromelanin. We conclude that elevated creatine deposits may be indicators of dysfunctional oxidative processes in some ALS cases.",M2

METHODS: We investigated metabolite profiles in the serum of 30 patients with ALS, 10 patients of Hirayama disease, which served as a neurological disease control and 25 healthy controls by using (1) H NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, the ALS patients had higher quantities of glutamate (P&lt;0.001), beta-hydroxybutyrate (P&lt;0.001), acetate (P&lt;0.01), acetone (P&lt;0.05), and formate (P&lt;0.001), and lower concentrations of glutamine (P&lt;0.02), histidine (P&lt;0.001) and N-acetyl derivatives. On the other hand, Hirayama disease patients had significantly higher median concentrations of pyruvate (P&lt;0.05), glutamate (P&lt;0.001), formate (P&lt;0.05) and lower median concentrations of N-acetyl derivatives. Furthermore, we also found that serum glutamate showed a positive correlation (P&lt;0.001, r=0.6487) whereas, histidine showed a negative correlation (P&lt;0.001, r=-0.5641) with the duration of the disease in ALS. CONCLUSIONS: Such (1) H NMR study of serum may reveal abnormal metabolite patterns, which could have the potential to serve as surrogate markers for monitoring ALS disease progression.",M2
20095022,"Excitability properties of mouse motor axons in the mutant SOD1(G93A) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Non-invasive excitability studies of motor axons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) have revealed a changing pattern of abnormal membrane properties with disease progression, but the heterogeneity of the changes has made it difficult to relate them to pathophysiology. The SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS displays more synchronous motoneuron pathology. Multiple excitability measures of caudal and sciatic nerves in mutant and wild-type mice were compared before onset of signs and during disease progression (4-19 weeks), and they were related to changes in muscle fiber histochemistry. Excitability differences indicated a modest membrane depolarization in SOD1(G93A) axons at about the time of symptom onset (8 weeks), possibly due to deficient energy supply. Previously described excitability changes in ALS patients, suggesting altered sodium and potassium conductances, were not seen in the mice. This suggests that those changes relate to features of the human disease that are not well represented in the animal model.",M2
20094844,"Expression of human A4V mutant Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe: investigations of its toxic properties.Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the removal of superoxide radicals generated in various biological oxidations. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, occurring in families (FALS) and sporadically (SALS). FALS and SALS are distinguishable genetically but not clinically. More than 100 point mutations in the human SOD 1 gene have been identified that cause FALS. In order to determine the effects of mutant SOD protein, we first cloned wild-type and A4V mutant human SOD1 into Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This study shows viabilities and some antioxidant properties including SOD, catalase, proteasomal activity, and protein carbonyl levels of transformants in SOD1 deleted strain (MN415); and its parental strain (JY741) at different stress conditions. There was no more oxidative damage in the human mutant SOD carrying the transformant strain compared with other strains. These results may help to explain whether ALS progresses as a consequence of cellular oxidative damage.",M2
20092693,"Quality of life and motor impairment in <e>ALS</e>: Italian validation of ALSAQ.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity and reliability of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis assessment questionnaire (ALSAQ) in an Italian cohort of ALS patients and to further characterize the relationship between motor impairment and quality of life (QoL) in ALS. METHODS: Seventy-six patients completed the Italian version of ALSAQ-40 and ALSAQ-5. To verify test-retest reliability, 30 patients were revaluated after 3 months. The medical outcome study short form 36 (MOS SF-36) questionnaire and revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFR-R) scale were used to assess Italian ALSAQ-40 construct validity. The limb muscles' Medical Research Council (MRC) score and forced vital capacity (FVC) were used to measure the degree of motor impairment. RESULTS: The Italian ALSAQ-40 showed a very good internal consistency (all subscales Cronbach's alpha&gt;0.86) and a good construct validity as shown by the patterns of correlation between the subscales and SF-36 (resp. ALSFRS-R) scores. ALSAQ-5 showed a positive correlation with the corresponding ALS patient total score and subscale scores of the ALSAQ-40 (Spearman's correlation coefficient&gt;0.73). The emotional functioning subscale did not correlate with any motor impairment measures. DISCUSSION: Italian ALSAQ-40 and ALSAQ-5 psychometric properties are reliable and similar to those showed by the original English version. We observed emotional aspects to be distinct from physical involvement.",M2
20084835,"The role of AMPA receptors and VEGF in <e>ALS</e>.The progressive degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex and multifactorial process. Both excitotoxicity (excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors) and a shortage of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been implicated in the disease pathogenesis. In this study, both disease mechanisms were further characterized and their therapeutic potential was evaluated. Motor neurons were found to be particularly vulnerable to AMPA receptor stimulation (one subtype of glutamate receptors) and the toxicity was initiated by the influx of calcium ions through the AMPA receptors. Only AMPA receptors that lack a certain subunit (GluR2) are permeable to calcium ions, and compared to other neurons motor neurons had low GluR2 levels. Reducing GluR2 levels aggravated motor neuron death in culture and accelerated the process of motor neuron degeneration in vivo. The regulation of GluR2 expression was investigated further. Astrocytes were found to influence neuronal GluR2 expression and thus their vulnerability to excitotoxicity. In addition, the growth factor VEGF, which could slow down motor neuron degeneration in rats, stimulated GluR2 expression in motor neurons and protected against excessive AMPA receptor stimulation, providing a link between two important disease mechanisms in ALS. Clinical trials with AMPA receptor antagonists and VEGF will hopefully lead to a better treatment of patients with ALS.",M2
20082726,"Association between novel TARDBP mutations and Chinese patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.BACKGROUND: TARDBP mutations have been reported in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) in different populations except Chinese. The present aim is to investigate the association between TARDBP mutations and Chinese patients with ALS. METHODS: 71 SALS patients and 5 FALS families with non-SOD1 mutations were screened for TARDBP mutations via direct sequencing. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous variation, Ser292Asn (875G&gt;A), was identified in the proband and 4 asymptomatic relatives including the children of the dead patient from a FALS family. Thus the dead patient, the proband's brother, was speculated to carry Ser292Asn though his sample was unavailable to the detection. This variation was not found in 200 unrelated control subjects. A homology search of the TDP-43 protein in different species demonstrated that it was highly conserved. Also, it was predicted to be deleterious to protein function with SIFT-calculated probabilities of 0.00. Therefore, Ser292Asn is predicted to be a pathogenic mutation. In addition, we have found two silent mutations (Gly40Gly and Ala366Ala) and one novel polymorphism (239-18t&gt;c). CONCLUSIONS: The present data have extended the spectrum of TARDBP mutations and polymorphisms, and supported the pathological role of TDP-43 in Chinese ALS patients.",M2
20082418,"Role of Renshaw cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.In this article the role of Renshaw cell involvement in experimental amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is discussed, with an emphasis on the anatomy, physiology, and possible role in motor control of Renshaw cells. These cells are located in lamina VII of the spinal cord, are excited by motor axon collaterals, and inhibit homonymous and synergistic motoneurons in a negative-feedback fashion (recurrent inhibition). Early dysfunction and/or loss of Renshaw cells has been suggested to occur in experimental ALS, and the hypothesis has been put forward that this may be the event that makes motoneurons more susceptible to glutamatergic toxicity in ALS. However, Renshaw cell properties and connectivity-in particular, the lack of recurrent inhibition in the more distal muscles of the limbs where, on the contrary, initial wasting is prominent in human ALS-make it unlikely that impairment of Renshaw cells is a general feature of the human form of the disease.",M2
20081222,"Multifactor dimensionality reduction for graphics processing units enables genome-wide testing of epistasis in sporadic <e>ALS</e>.MOTIVATION: Epistasis, the presence of gene-gene interactions, has been hypothesized to be at the root of many common human diseases, but current genome-wide association studies largely ignore its role. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a powerful model-free method for detecting epistatic relationships between genes, but computational costs have made its application to genome-wide data difficult. Graphics processing units (GPUs), the hardware responsible for rendering computer games, are powerful parallel processors. Using GPUs to run MDR on a genome-wide dataset allows for statistically rigorous testing of epistasis. RESULTS: The implementation of MDR for GPUs (MDRGPU) includes core features of the widely used Java software package, MDR. This GPU implementation allows for large-scale analysis of epistasis at a dramatically lower cost than the standard CPU-based implementations. As a proof-of-concept, we applied this software to a genome-wide study of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We discovered a statistically significant two-SNP classifier and subsequently replicated the significance of these two SNPs in an independent study of ALS. MDRGPU makes the large-scale analysis of epistasis tractable and opens the door to statistically rigorous testing of interactions in genome-wide datasets. AVAILABILITY: MDRGPU is open source and available free of charge from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mdr.",M2
20071543,"Collapsin response mediator protein 4a (CRMP4a) is upregulated in motoneurons of mutant SOD1 mice and can trigger motoneuron axonal degeneration and cell death.Embryonic motoneurons from mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>), but not wild-type motoneurons, can be triggered to die by exposure to nitric oxide (NO), leading to activation of a motoneuron-specific signaling pathway downstream of the death receptor Fas/CD95. To identify effectors of mSOD1-dependent cell death, we performed a proteomic analysis. Treatment of cultured mSOD1 motoneurons with NO led to a 2.5-fold increase in levels of collapsin response mediator protein 4a (CRMP4a). In vivo, the percentage of mSOD1 lumbar motoneurons expressing CRMP4 in mSOD1 mice increased progressively from presymptomatic to early-onset stages, reaching a maximum of 25%. Forced adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of CRMP4a in wild-type motoneurons in vitro triggered a process of axonal degeneration and cell death affecting 60% of motoneurons, whereas silencing of CRMP4a in mSOD1 motoneurons protected them from NO-induced death. In vivo, AAV-mediated overexpression of CRMP4a but not CRMP2 led to the death of 30% of the lumbar motoneurons and an 18% increase in denervation of neuromuscular junctions in the gastrocnemius muscle. Our data identify CRMP4a as a potential early effector in the neurodegenerative process in ALS.",M2
20060132,"Methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, lowers brain glutamine and glutamate in a mouse model of <e>ALS</e>.In an effort to alter the levels of neurochemicals involved in excitotoxicity, we treated mice with methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Since glutamate toxicity has been proposed as a mechanism for the degeneration of motor neurons in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, we tested the effects of MSO on the transgenic mouse that overexpresses the mutant human SOD1(G93A) gene, an animal model for the primary inherited form of the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This treatment in vivo reduced glutamine synthetase activity measured in vitro by 85%. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, with magic angle spinning of intact samples of brain tissue, showed that MSO treatment reduced brain levels of glutamine by 60% and of glutamate by 30% in both the motor cortex and the anterior striatum, while also affecting levels of GABA and glutathione. Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis revealed that MSO treatment significantly extended the lifespan of these mice by 8% (p&lt;0.01). These results show that in the SOD1(G93A) model of neurodegenerative diseases, the concentration of brain glutamate (determined with (1)H-MRS) can be lowered by inhibiting in vivo the synthesis of glutamine with non-toxic doses of MSO.",M2
20055380,"Induction of amyloid fibrils by the C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been identified as the major ubiquitinated aggregates in the inclusion bodies in the patients of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) since 2006 and become a crucial culprit for ALS and related motor neuron diseases. Recent literature has further indicated that the major components of these aggregates are hyper-phosphorylated TDP-43 C-terminus. In an effort to clarify the conformational and physical properties of its disordered C-terminal domain, we have synthesized several peptide fragments and shown that only D1 within D1-4 can form twisted fibrils with a cross section of approximately 11 nm in width under the incubation of phosphate buffer. In contrast, the D2-4 peptides all formed amorphous aggregates, showing different aggregation propensities. In addition to D1, two pathological mutant peptides, A315T and G294A, can also form fibrils that share similar shape and morphology with neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. We propose that the residues with this region (287-322), which contains myriads of glycine repeats, may contribute significantly to the fiber formation as well as aggregation propensity. Moreover, from the conformational characterizations of D1, A315T, and G294A with EM, CD, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, we found that all three peptides formed an amyloid structure, providing insights into the nature of its aggregation vis a vis the other fragments in the C-terminus of TDP-43.",M2
20054757,"The genetics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) is a devastating disorder of still unknown aetiology and pathogenesis. It is characterized by a progressive and selective loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The majority of ALS cases (90%) are sporadic and in approximately 10% the disorder is familial. In the light of recent studies, the familial forms might however be more frequent. The article describes mutations of genes linked to both sporadic and familial ALS and the role of the proteins they encode.",M2
20079229,"[The electromyography of rectus abdominis muscle in the diagnosis of polyneuropathy]OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of electromyography ( EMG) of rectus abdominis muscle in the diagnosis of polyneuropathy. METHODS: 109 patients with polyneuropathy were studied. The routine nerve conduction study was done and standard EMG was recorded from rectus abdominis muscle, first dorsal interosseous muscle and tibialis anterior muscle. The parameters studied included spontaneous activity fibrillation potentials (fib) and positive sharp waves (psw); duration, amplitude and percentage of polyphasic wave of motor unit action potential (MUAP) and pattern of recruitment. A group of controls and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) were studied at the same time. EMG parameters of rectus abdominis muscles were compared among patients with polyneuropathy, patients with ALS and the controls. RESULTS: EMG of rectus abdominis muscle in the patients with polyneuropathy showed neurogenic change. The amplitude of motor unit potential in patients with polyneuropathy (451.67 +/- 75.01) microV was higher than that of the controls (373.78 +/- 56.46)microV(t = 2.01, P &lt; 0.04) and lower than that of patients with ALS (537.19 +/- 159.04) microV (t = 2.32, P &lt; 0.03). CONCLUSION: EMG of rectus abdominis muscle might be used to find the lesion of intercostal nerve in polyneuropathy.",M2
20074360,"Association of smoking with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk and survival in men and women: a prospective study.BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiologic studies have examined the association of smoking with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<e>ALS</e>) incidence, but their results have been inconsistent. Moreover, limited information exists on the association between smoking and survival in ALS patients. We evaluated the association of smoking with ALS incidence and survival in a population-based cohort. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested in the General Practice Research Database, a computerized clinical database in the United Kingdom. Cases were 1143 individuals with a diagnosis of ALS; 11,371 matched controls were selected among GPRD participants free of ALS. Predictors of survival were determined in the ALS cases. Smoking information was obtained from the computer database. RESULTS: Smoking was not associated with the risk of ALS in this population. The rate ratio (RR) of ALS comparing ever versus never smokers was 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.34. In analysis stratified by gender, however, ever smoking was associated with ALS in women (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04-2.23) but not in men (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.06). Mortality was 71% after 2.1 average years of follow-up. Old age and female sex were associated with lower survival. Smoking was a predictor of mortality only in women. Comparing ever versus never smokers, RR (95% CI) of death was 1.31 (1.04-1.65) in women, and 0.90 (0.72-1.11) in men. CONCLUSION: In this large population-based study, smoking was associated with ALS risk and worse survival in women but not in men.",M2
