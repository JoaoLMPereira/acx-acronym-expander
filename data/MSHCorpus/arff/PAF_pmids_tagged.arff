16772807,"Neuropharmacologic distinction of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension syndromes.BACKGROUND: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) characterizes pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD) with autonomic failure. We used neuropharmacologic probes that might distinguish these diseases based on loss of sympathetic noradrenergic nerves in PAF and PD + OH but not in MSA, and related the results to neurochemical and neuroimaging findings in the same patients. METHODS: Patients with neurogenic OH (PD + OH; N = 35), MSA (N = 41), and PAF (N = 12) received iv trimethaphan (TRI), which inhibits sympathetic nerve traffic, or yohimbine (YOH), which stimulates sympathetic traffic. Dependent measures included blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, and interventricular septal myocardial radioactivity after iv injection of the sympathoneural imaging agent, 6-[F]fluorodopamine. RESULTS: The PD + OH and PAF groups had smaller pressor responses to YOH (12 +/- 8 and 13 +/- 1 mm Hg) and depressor responses to TRI (-14 +/- 8 and -17 +/- 7 mm Hg) than did the MSA group (43 +/- 8 mm Hg, -57 +/- 8 mm Hg; P = 0.01, P = 0.03). The PD + OH and MSA groups did not differ in NE responses to YOH and TRI. The depressor response to TRI, the pressor response to YOH, and the blood pressure difference between YOH and TRI all correlated positively with myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity. CONCLUSIONS: The PD + OH resembles PAF and differs from MSA in hemodynamic responses to drugs that alter NE release from sympathetic nerves. The results fit with sympathetic noradrenergic denervation in PD + OH and PAF but not in MSA.",M1
16438986,"Cerebral vasomotor reactivity in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure.Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) are neurodegenerative disorders frequently associated with orthostatic hypotension and syncope, though with different underlying mechanisms. Cerebral hemodynamic responses in these three neurodegenerative diseases are still incompletely studied and it is possible that they would be differentially affected. We measured blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and vertebral artery (VA) in patients with these disorders and investigated whether cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) differs in these three disorders. Twenty-four patients (9 with PD, 10 with MSA and 5 with PAF) were studied. VMR was assessed in the MCA and VA, using transcranial Doppler (TCD) and Diamox test (injection of 1 g acetazolamide i.v.) with the patients in a recumbent position. The percent difference between BFV before and after acetazolamide injection was defined as VMR% and the results were compared by ANOVA. The mean MCA and VA blood flow velocities were similar in the three disorders and within normal limits for our laboratory. The mean MCA VMR values were 37.5+/-24.0%, 27.9+/-28.0% and 38.0+/-33.9% in PD, MSA and PAF, respectively. The VA VMR values were 22.9+/-23.6%, 32.4+/-38.0% and 18.9+/-18.3%, respectively, with no significant differences between the groups. We conclude that BFV is normal in PD, MSA and PAF and that the VMR, as investigated by TCD and the Diamox test, did not disclose differences in cerebral vasomotor responses between these conditions.",M1
16269589,"Cardiac and extracardiac sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease with orthostatic hypotension and in pure autonomic failure.The uptake of 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine by cardiac noradrenergic nerves enables visualization of the sympathetic innervation of the left ventricular myocardium by PET. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) (PD+OH) or with pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) have markedly decreased myocardial 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity, consistent with cardiac sympathetic denervation, a phenomenon that neurochemical, neuropharmacologic, and, most recently, postmortem neuropathologic studies have confirmed. In this study, we examined whether 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine can visualize sympathetic innervation in extracardiac organs and, if so, whether patients with PD+OH or PAF have neuroimaging evidence of extracardiac noradrenergic denervation. METHODS: To validate the method, healthy volunteers underwent 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine scanning of the head, thorax, and abdomen, with or without treatment with desipramine to block sympathoneural uptake of catecholamines. (13)N-Ammonia scanning was used to address possible group differences in 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine delivery by blood perfusion. RESULTS: Desipramine treatment was associated with decreased 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity in the heart, renal cortex, and thyroid gland but not in the liver, spleen, renal pelvis, or salivary glands. Both the PD+OH group and the PAF group had decreased 6-(18)F-fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity in the heart (P &lt; 0.0001) and renal cortex (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). The PD+OH group also had decreased radioactivity in the thyroid gland (P = 0.01). Neither group had decreased radioactivity in the other organs, after correction for (13)N-ammonia-derived radioactivity. CONCLUSION: 6-(18)F-Fluorodopamine scanning visualizes sympathetic innervation in the heart, renal cortex, and thyroid gland. Both PD+OH and PAF involve decreased noradrenergic innervation that is most prominent in the heart but is also detectable in extracardiac organs.",M1
15548493,"The effects of water ingestion on orthostatic hypotension in two groups of chronic autonomic failure: multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure.BACKGROUND: Oral ingestion of water increases seated blood pressure in patients with chronic autonomic failure by mechanisms that remain unclear. As orthostatic hypotension is common in chronic autonomic failure, and is not always adequately controlled by medication, the potential benefits of water ingestion on standing blood pressure were studied in two types of autonomic failure: multiple system atrophy (MSA), in which the lesion is central and pre-ganglionic, and pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>), in which the lesion is post-ganglionic. METHODS: In 14 patients with autonomic failure (seven PAF and seven MSA) standing blood pressure and heart rate were measured before, and 15 and 35 minutes after ingestion of 480 ml distilled water. Patients remained seated for 15 minutes after water ingestion, with beat to beat cardiovascular indices measured with the Portapres II device with subsequent Modelflow analysis. RESULTS: Standing prior to water ingestion caused a significant fall in blood pressure in all patients. After water ingestion there was a rise in seated blood pressure. Seated and standing blood pressure at 15 and 35 minutes after water ingestion was significantly higher than before water, with an improvement in orthostatic symptoms. The time to first significant rise in seated blood pressure occurred at 5 minutes post water ingestion in PAF and at 13 minutes in MSA. These increases were accompanied by increases in total peripheral resistance, reaching significance by 5 minutes in PAF and 13 minutes in MSA. There were no significant changes in cardiac output, stroke volume, or ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Water is thus beneficial in improving standing BP in AF, acting within 15 minutes in both MSA and PAF. The earlier onset of the pressor effect in PAF may reflect the differing lesion site and underlying pathophysiology between these conditions.",M1
12707437,"Plasma levels of catechols and metanephrines in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.BACKGROUND: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) usually results from deficient release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) when the patient stands up. In pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) and PD with NOH, sympathetic denervation can explain this deficiency, whereas in multiple-system atrophy (MSA), deficient baroreflex regulation of sympathetic traffic to intact terminals probably causes the NOH. From the concept of a unitary sympathoadrenomedullary system, one might predict parallel sympathoneural and adrenomedullary abnormalities in NOH. OBJECTIVE: To test the concept of parallel sympathoneural and adrenomedullary abnormalities in NOH by simultaneous measurements of plasma levels of catechols and metanephrines. METHODS: Antecubital venous blood drawn via an indwelling cannula with the subject supine was assayed for catecholamines (NE, epinephrine [EPI]), dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and metanephrines (normetanephrine [NMN] and metanephrine [MN]) in patients with PAF, PD + NOH, or MSA + NOH. Control subjects had PD lacking NOH or were normal volunteers at least 35 years old. Cardiac sympathetic innervation was assessed by 6-[18F]fluorodopamine PET scanning. RESULTS: The three NOH groups differed clearly in patterns of plasma catechols and metanephrines. The PAF group had low NE, DHPG, NMN, EPI, and MN levels, the group with MSA + NOH had generally normal levels, and the PD + NOH group low NMN levels and low DHPG levels for given NE levels but normal mean NE, EPI, and MN levels. All patients with PAF or PD + NOH had markedly decreased 6-[18F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity throughout the left ventricular myocardium; all patients with MSA + NOH had normal radioactivity. CONCLUSIONS: PAF involves generalized loss of sympathoadrenomedullary cells, MSA + NOH intact sympathoadrenomedullary cells, and PD + NOH intact adrenomedullary cells but organ-selective sympathetic denervation, especially in the heart.",M1
12390954,"Modulation of QT interval during autonomic nervous system blockade in humans.BACKGROUND: It is thought that the autonomic nervous system modulates QT interval, but traditional autonomic blockade combining propranolol and atropine has produced conflicting results. We used the alternative approach of interrupting neurotransmission at the level of autonomic ganglia to determine its effect on the QT interval. METHODS AND RESULTS: We infused trimethaphan at increasing doses (0.5 to 10 mg/min IV) while monitoring heart rate, heart rate variability spectra, QT interval, and blood pressure in 10 normal volunteers, 9 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 8 patients with pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>). The QT interval was corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTc). Patients with PAF had very low heart rate variability and a prolonged QTc at baseline (465+/-8 ms) compared with patients with MSA (448+/-6 ms) and normal subjects (432+/-6 ms). In normal subjects, trimethaphan dose-dependently prolonged QTc (to 469+/-7 ms), decreased RR interval (995+/-45 to 670+/-35 ms), and abolished heart rate variability. In MSA patients, trimethaphan also prolonged QTc (to 463+/-7 ms) and reduced heart rate variability but did not significantly change RR interval (from 813+/-38 to 801+/-39). CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic blockade prolongs QT interval in normal subjects to a similar duration as in PAF patients. Furthermore, blocking residual autonomic tone in PAF patients is associated with a further increase in QT interval length. Patients with MSA have greater residual sympathetic tone and greater prolongation of the QT interval during ganglionic blockade than PAF patients.",M1
8899251,"Neurohumoral, peptidergic and biochemical responses to supine exercise in two groups with primary autonomic failure: Shy-Drager syndrome/multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure.The neurohumoral, peptidergic and biochemical responses to supine leg exercise were studied in two groups with primary autonomic failure: Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS, n = 15) and pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>, n = 15), to determine if these accounted for exercise-induced hypotension and the greater blood pressure (BP) fall in PAF. Responses were compared to normal subjects (controls, n = 15), in whom BP rose with exercise. Resting plasma noradrenaline (NA) was higher in controls than SDS, and was lowest in PAF. With exercise, NA increased in controls, with a small rise in SDS, but no change in PAF. Resting plasma adrenaline (A) was higher in controls and SDS than PAF, with no change during exercise. Plasma dopamine was unrecordable at all stages in all groups. Resting plasma renin activity (PRA) was higher in controls than SDS and PAF, and was unchanged with exercise in all groups. Plasma insulin, C-peptide and serum growth hormone (GH) were similar at rest and with exercise in the three groups. Plasma glucose was higher at rest in SDS and PAF, and increased with exercise in all three groups. In conclusion, neither exercise-induced hypotension, nor the differences between SDS and PAF could be related to abnormalities in the release of A, PRA, insulin, glucose or GH. The abnormal NA response to exercise was consistent with the BP fall being due to inadequate compensatory sympathetic activity. In SDS, the small NA increase, in the presence of supersensitivity, may have reduced their BP fall as compared to PAF. These results suggest that impaired sympathetic neural activity is a key factor in exercise-induced hypotension.",M1
7675004,"[Autonomic failure as the cause of vertigo and syncope]BACKGROUND: Vertigo and syncope often occur during orthostatic conditions. A possible cause is asympathicotonic dysregulation with a fall of blood pressure and no increase in heart rate. After the exclusion of secondary disturbances of autonomic innervation. g. in diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological side effects, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, primary reasons must be considered. We present 2 cases of primary autonomic failure. PATIENTS: Patient 1 had Parkinson-syndrome, impaired bladder function and orthostatic dysregulation with a maximal drop of blood pressure to 60/40 mm Hg. Patient 2 showed orthostatic dysregulation with a minimal blood pressure of 70/30 mm Hg without further symptoms, in a tilt table examination catecholamines were measured during orthostatic conditions. Patient 1 had normal, and patient 2 very low resting catecholamine plasma levels. Neither patient reacted with a rise of plasma catecholamines when tilted to an upright position. These findings are diagnostic of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in patient 1 and pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) in patient 2. DISCUSSION: In PAP only dysautonomic symptoms are found. It has a favourable prognosis. MSA consists of an autonomic dysregulation in combination with parkinsonism, cerebellary and bulbar symptoms, prognosis quo ad vitam is poor. Diagnosis is often established by a tilt table examination and radiology findings, and is often late. Treatment of both diseases consists of pharmacological, e.g. fludrocortisone, vasopressin analogues and ergotamine tartrate as well as non-pharmacological blood pressure stabilizing measures.",M1
7796074,"Postural hypotension enhanced by exercise in patients with chronic autonomic failure.The effect of supine exercise on blood pressure (BP), measured while recumbent and after head-up postural change, was investigated in three groups with marked postural hypotension due to chronic autonomic failure: 15 with associated neurological impairment (Shy-Drager syndrome, SDS, multiple system atrophy); 15 with pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) and two with a deficiency of the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH deficiency). Fifteen normal subjects were controls. In controls, exercise increased supine BP, and there was no postural fall before or after exercise. In SDS and PAF, however, exercise produced a substantial fall in BP, which was greater in PAF. In both groups, BP fell to a lower level on standing after than before exercise. In DBH deficiency, there was little change in BP with exercise, but BP fell to a lower level on standing after exercise. In all three groups with autonomic failure, there were more symptoms of postural hypotension on standing after exercise. The influence of exercise on both supine and postural BP, therefore, should be considered in the clinical and laboratory assessment of autonomic dysfunction.",M1
7602525,"Abnormal cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to supine exercise in human subjects with sympathetic dysfunction.1. The cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to supine leg exercise were measured in fifteen normal subjects (controls) and in three groups with sympathetic dysfunction: fifteen with central failure (Shy-Drager syndrome; SDS), fifteen with peripheral failure (pure autonomic failure; <e>PAF</e>) and two with isolated dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency (DBH deficiency). 2. With exercise, blood pressure increased in controls, fell markedly in SDS and PAF and was unchanged in DBH deficiency. After exercise, blood pressure rapidly returned to baseline in controls, but remained low in SDS and PAF. With exercise, heart rate increased more in controls than SDS or PAF; the response varied in DBH deficiency. 3. With exercise, cardiac output increased similarly in controls, SDS and PAF, with a larger increase in DBH deficiency. Vascular resistance fell less in controls than SDS, PAF and DBH deficiency. 4. With exercise, plasma noradrenaline increased in controls only; plasma adrenaline remained unchanged in all groups. In DBH deficiency, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were undetectable, but plasma dopamine was elevated and rose further with exercise. 5. Supine exercise substantially lowered blood pressure in sympathetic failure due to SDS and PAF. In DBH deficiency blood pressure was unchanged; this lack of fall may have been due to vasoconstriction induced by dopamine and other substances released from otherwise intact sympathetic terminals, or to preserved cardiac vagal function.",M1
7892755,"High beta-adrenoceptor density on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in progressive multiple sclerosis: a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction?In multiple sclerosis (MS) up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been attributed to either autonomic dysfunction, inflammation or a combination of the two. We have compared secondary progressive MS patients with normal subjects (NS) and two models of autonomic dysfunction; pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome). There was up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS and PAF patients but not in MSA patients. Only in PAF patients beta-adrenoceptor up-regulation was correlated with low plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad). In addition to studies in the basal state, measurements also were made after the centrally acting sympatholytic agent clonidine. These were combined with haemodynamic and neurohormonal measurements. After clonidine, there was a fall in blood pressure in NS and MSA patients but not in MS and PAF patients; a rise in growth hormone (GH) in NS and PAF patients but not in MS and MSA patients; and an up-regulation in PBMCs beta-adrenoceptors in NS but not in MS, MSA and PAF patients. Up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS could be attributed to autonomic dysfunction but the disparity between MS and PAF patients when considering their plasma levels of NA and Ad argue against. Although the neurohormonal responses to clonidine and the physiological assessment of autonomic function in progressive MS patients, demonstrate central autonomic dysfunction resembling that of the MSA patients, the normal basal beta-adrenoceptor densities in the latter, suggests that the up-regulation of these receptors is independent of the central autonomic dysfunction in MS.",M1
8170565,"Beta-adrenoceptor expression on circulating mononuclear cells of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and autonomic failure patients before and after reduction of central sympathetic outflow by clonidine.There is a short-term up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after reduction of central sympathetic outflow by clonidine in normal individuals. We have studied beta-adrenoceptor number and affinity on PBMC in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>), and multiple system atrophy (MSA; Shy-Drager syndrome) patients and age- and sex-matched normal controls (NC) before and after intravenous administration of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist which lowers blood pressure predominantly by reducing CNS sympathetic outflow. Basal beta-adrenoceptor density was high in PAF but within the normal range in PD and MSA patients. After clonidine there was a decrease in plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad) in PD, MSA, and NC, and an increase in growth hormone (GH) in PD, PAF, and NC. NC. In PAF, NA and Ad remained unchanged. In MSA, there was no increase in GH levels. There was an up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMC at 30 and 60 minutes after clonidine administration, which returned to baseline values after 2 hours, and the affinity of the receptors was decreased in NC and PD patients. Intracellular production of cAMP after isoproterenol stimulation demonstrated that the up-regulation was not functional. Up-regulation after clonidine did not occur in PAF and MSA patients. The observed correlation of plasma NA and sympathetic defect with basal and clonidine-induced up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMC may provide insight into beta-adrenoceptor changes in other tissues and also help in differentiating subgroups of autonomic failure patients.",M1
8492945,"Cardiovascular and hormonal responses to liquid food challenge in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure.We investigated the effect of a balanced liquid meal on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (with patients supine and during head-up tilt), and on levels of plasma catecholamines, glucose, and insulin, in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>), and in healthy subjects (controls). After food, supine BP fell in IPD, but to a greater extent in MSA and PAF. In controls, BP was unchanged. Head-up tilt did not lower BP in IPD and controls, but there was a postprandial fall to lower levels in both MSA and PAF. Plasma norepinephrine levels rose in IPD pre- and postprandially during tilt, but were unchanged in MSA and PAF. These data suggest that in IPD, food causes a smaller fall in supine BP than in MSA and PAF. In IPD, as in controls, food does not induce or unmask postural hypotension, unlike in MSA and PAF, in which BP falls to even lower levels. There are therefore differences in the responses to food ingestion between these groups. This may be of value in separation of these disorders at an early stage.",M1
1940947,"The influence of food on postural hypotension in three groups with chronic autonomic failure--clinical and therapeutic implications.The effect of a balanced liquid meal on supine and postural blood pressure (BP) responses was investigated in three groups of patients with chronic autonomic failure; 10 with associated neurological impairment (multiple system atrophy (MSA), Shy-Drager syndrome) and seven without (of which five had pure autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>); and two had a deficiency of the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase, DBH-deficiency). All had marked postural hypotension. Subjects with normal autonomic function were also studied. In MSA and PAF food lowered supine BP substantially, with a more rapid and greater fall in PAF. After food, the levels of BP reached were considerably lower because of the reduced supine BP and many had to be returned to the horizontal position earlier than before. Ingestion of a similar volume of water alone had no effect in MSA or PAF. In DBH deficiency, food had variable but minimal effects on BP while supine and during head-up tilt. In subjects with normal autonomic function food did not affect BP. The BP responses to food thus varied in the three groups with chronic autonomic failure. The influence of food on both supine and postural BP therefore should be considered in the clinical and laboratory assessment of autonomic dysfunction and in relation to therapeutic approaches, designed to alleviate postural hypotension.",M1
3435079,"Somatic and autonomic function in progressive autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy.We studied 62 consecutive patients with progressive autonomic failure (<e>PAF</e>) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) (26 PAF; 36 MSA). Patients were well matched in age (67 vs 66 years), duration (39 vs 36 months), and severity of autonomic failure (median values for PAF and MSA). Peripheral somatic neuropathy occurred in 2 patients with PAF and 7 patients with MSA. Postganglionic sudomotor and vasomotor functions were studied using the quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test and supine plasma norepinephrine. The extent and severity of autonomic failure were assessed by the thermoregulatory sweat test, by heart rate responses to deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver, and by blood pressure recordings. Severe and widespread anhidrosis was found in both PAF and MSA patients. Postganglionic sudomotor failure occurred at the forearm in 50% each of PAF and MSA patients and at the foot in 69% and 66% of PAF and MSA patients, respectively. However, postganglionic sudomotor function was preserved in some patients with anhidrosis on thermoregulatory sweat test, indicating a preganglionic lesion. Vagal abnormalities were found in 77% and 81% of PAF and MSA patients. Supine plasma free norepinephrine values were significantly reduced in PAF (p less than 0.001), but not in MSA, patients. Standing plasma norepinephrine values were reduced in both PAF (p less than 0.001) and MSA (p less than 0.001) patients. We conclude the following: (1) PAF is characterized by combined postganglionic sudomotor and adrenergic failure. (2) MSA is associated with a similar frequency of postganglionic sudomotor failure, but postganglionic adrenergic denervation was uncommon. (3) Preganglionic neuron is also involved in both disorders, but more severely in MSA. (4) Somatic neuropathy may occur.",M1
3961183,"Multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager syndrome): MR imaging.The Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS) is a form of progressive autonomic nervous system failure (<e>PAF</e>) with orthostatic hypotension and associated extrapyramidal involvement that is often mistaken for Parkinson disease. SDS includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration which is attended by PAF. Eight patients with SDS were studied on a 0.5-T superconducting system utilizing T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) and T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences and also on a 1.5-T system using spin-echo sequences. With IR sequences, atrophy of the putamina was demonstrated in patients with SDS that is consistent with findings of neuronal loss in these nuclei reported on postmortem examinations. An abnormal decrease in signal intensity of the putamina, particularly along their lateral and posterior portions, was also detected, predominantly on T2-weighted sequences, and in three cases on T1-weighted spin-echo sequences. Abnormalities were detected on both imagers but were shown with greater clarity on the 1.5-T device. SDS is the first disease in which convincing basal ganglia changes have been shown in vivo exclusively by MR imaging.",M1
20421642,"Mouse and human eosinophils degranulate in response to platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and lysoPAF via a PAF-receptor-independent mechanism: evidence for a novel receptor.Platelet-activating factor (PAF [1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine]) is a phospholipid mediator released from activated macrophages, mast cells, and basophils that promotes pathophysiologic inflammation. Eosinophil responses to PAF are complex and incompletely elucidated. We show in this article that PAF and its 2-deacetylated metabolite (lysoPAF) promote degranulation (release of eosinophil peroxidase) via a mechanism that is independent of the characterized PAFR. Specifically, we demonstrate that receptor antagonists CV-3988 and WEB-2086 and pertussis toxin have no impact on PAF- or lysoPAF-mediated degranulation. Furthermore, cultured mouse eosinophils from PAFR(-/-) bone marrow progenitors degranulate in response to PAF and lysoPAF in a manner indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts. In addition to PAF and lysoPAF, human eosinophils degranulate in response to lysophosphatidylcholine, but not phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylethanolamine, demonstrating selective responses to phospholipids with a choline head-group and minimal substitution at the sn-2 hydroxyl. Human eosinophils release preformed cytokines in response to PAF, but not lysoPAF, also via a PAFR-independent mechanism. Mouse eosinophils do not release cytokines in response to PAF or lysoPAF, but they are capable of doing so in response to IL-6. Overall, our work provides the first direct evidence for a role for PAF in activating and inducing degranulation of mouse eosinophils, a crucial feature for the interpretation of mouse models of PAF-mediated asthma and anaphylaxis. Likewise, we document and define PAF and lysoPAF-mediated activities that are not dependent on signaling via PAFR, suggesting the existence of other unexplored molecular signaling pathways mediating responses from PAF, lysoPAF, and closely related phospholipid mediators.",M2

20412793,"Bepotastine besilate, a highly selective histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, suppresses vascular hyperpermeability and eosinophil recruitment in in vitro and in vivo experimental allergic conjunctivitis models.To elucidate the ocular pharmacological properties of bepotastine besilate, a selective histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, when compared with other histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, using guinea pig allergic conjunctivitis models and in vitro models of eosinophil recruitment and mast cell membrane stabilization. Conjunctival vascular hyperpermeability was studied in guinea pigs passively sensitized with anti-ovalbumin antiserum or following subconjunctival injection of histamine. Modulation of eosinophil recruitment was evaluated for both platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>)-induced eosinophil infiltration in guinea pigs and leukotriene B(4)-induced in vitro chemotaxis of guinea pig peritoneal eosinophils. Membrane-stabilizing effects of bepotastine also were studied with rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with the ionophore A23187. Histamine H(1) receptor antagonists including bepotastine besilate were topically administered before ovalbumin, histamine or PAF challenges for in vivo experiments or were added directly to mast cell and eosinophil medium in vitro. Bepotastine besilate significantly inhibited conjunctival vascular hyperpermeability in a dose-dependent manner with maximal effect for bepotastine besilate 1.5%. In separate in vivo experiments, bepotastine besilate 1.0% was significantly more effective than levocabastine 0.025% in the passive sensitization model or olopatadine 0.1% in the histamine-induced hyperpermeability model. Bepotastine besilate 1.0% further suppressed PAF-induced eosinophil infiltration into conjunctival tissue more effectively than ketotifen 0.05%. Chemotaxis of guinea pig peritoneal eosinophils and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro were also inhibited by addition of bepotastine. Olopatadine had a weak effect as compared to that of bepotastine on eosinophil chemotaxis and no effect on mast cell histamine release in our study conditions. Bepotastine besilate was more potent than olopatadine, ketotifen, or levocabastine in reducing vascular hyperpermeability in various animal models of allergic conjunctivitis. Mast cell function and eosinophil chemotaxis were also inhibited in vitro with bepotastine, suggesting bepotastine acts as an inhibitor of allergic response through multiple mechanisms: histamine H(1) receptor antagonism, mast cell stabilization, and inhibition of eosinophil migration to ocular inflammatory sites.",M2

20392487,"Activation of human mast cells through the platelet-activating factor receptor.BACKGROUND: In human subjects platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) concentrations are markedly increased in the plasma after anaphylactic reactions, and these correlate strongly with the severity of the response. The mechanism for the systemic spread of mast cell (MC) activation in anaphylaxis is often assumed to relate to the hematogenous spread of allergen, but this is implausible, and amplification mechanisms need to be considered. OBJECTIVE: We have investigated the ability of PAF to induce human MC degranulation using skin, lung, and peripheral blood (PB)-derived cultured MCs and the signaling pathways activated in PB-derived MCs in response to PAF. METHODS: The expression of PAF receptor was investigated by means of RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell-signaling pathways in PB-derived MCs in response to PAF were investigated by analyzing the effect of various inhibitors and the silencing of phospholipase C (PLC) mRNA on PAF-mediated histamine release. RESULTS: We show for the first time that PAF induces histamine release from human lung MCs and PB-derived MCs but not skin MCs. Activation of PAF receptor-coupled G(alphai) leads to degranulation through PLCgamma1 and PLCbeta2 activation in human MCs. PAF-induced degranulation was rapid, being maximal at 5 seconds, and was partially dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a mechanism whereby PAF mediates an amplification loop for MC activation in the generation of anaphylaxis.",M2
20187806,"Platelet-activating factor-induced intracellular signaling and release of cytokines and prostaglandin E2 in immortalized human corneal epithelial cells.PURPOSE AND METHODS: Immortalized human corneal epithelial (CEPI-17-CL4) cells were exposed to different concentrations of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and the mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) was studied using fluorometrics. Additionally, the production of the cytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) from PAF-stimulated cells was also determined using ELISA assays. RESULTS: While PAF, histamine, and bradykinin stimulated the mobilization of [Ca(2+)](i) in these cells, PAF was the least efficacious. [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization induced by PAF was inhibited by 2 PAF receptor antagonists, PCA-42481 and CV-6209 (both 10 microM), and by a phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122 (60% at 4 microM). PAF increased the production of PGE(2) (with maximum effect at 30 and 100 nM) and GM-CSF (maximum effect at 1 microM) in CEPI-17-CL4 cells. However, PAF did not stimulate the generation of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and MMP-1 to any significant level and in a consistent manner. PAF increased the incorporation of [(3)H]-thymidine into CEPI-17-CL4 cells with a maximal effect at 30 nM. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that functional PAF receptors are present on CEPI-17-CL4 cells that can activate mobilization of [Ca(2+)](i). Other consequences of PAF receptor activation in CEPI-17-CL4 cells are the generation of PGE(2) and certain proinflammatory cytokines such as GM-CSF, and increasing cell proliferation.",M2
20163539,"Rapamycin inhibits VEGF-induced microvascular hyperpermeability in vivo.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that rapamycin inhibits induced microvascular hyperpermeability directly in vivo. METHODS: Male golden Syrian hamsters (80-120 g) were treated with either rapamycin (at 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle at 24 hours and at 1 hour prior to preparation of the cheek pouch. Caveolin-1 scaffolding (1 mg/kg; positive inhibitory control) was injected i.p. 24 hours prior to the experiment. 10(-8) M vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or 10(-7) M platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) were topically applied to the cheek pouch. Microvascular permeability and arteriolar diameter were assessed using integrated optical intensity (IOI) and vascular wall imaging, respectively. RESULTS: Rapamycin at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg significantly reduced VEGF-stimulated mean IOI from 63.0 +/- 4.2 to 9.7 +/- 5.0 (85% reduction, P &lt; 0.001) and 3.6 +/- 2.7 (95% reduction, P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Rapamycin at 2 mg/kg also lowered VEGF-stimulated hyperpermeability (40% reduction, P &lt; 0.05). However, 10 mg/kg rapamycin increased VEGF-induced microvascular hyperpermeability. Rapamycin at 0.5 mg/kg attenuated VEGF-induced vasodilation and PAF-induced hyperpermeability, but did not inhibit PAF-induced vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: At therapeutically relevant concentrations, rapamycin inhibits VEGF- and PAF-induced microvascular permeability. This inhibition is (i) a direct effect on the endothelial barrier, and (ii) independent of arteriolar vasodilation. Rapamycin at 10 mg/kg stimulates effectors that increase microvascular permeability.",M2
20102491,"Platelet-activating factor and evidence of oxidative stress in the bronchoalveolar fluid of Thoroughbred colts during race training.BACKGROUND: Inflammatory airway disease (IAD) is prevalent in young racehorses during training, being the 2nd most commonly diagnosed ailment interrupting training of 2-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses. HYPOTHESIS: That stabling and exercise cause oxidative stress, release of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and inflammation in airways of Thoroughbred colts. ANIMALS: Colts in breeding farms (NC, n = 45), stabled for 30 days (EC, n = 40), and race trained (EX, n = 34). METHODS: Cytological profile and parameters of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) related to oxidative stress, bioactivity of the proinflammatory mediator PAF, catalase activity, and alveolar macrophage function. RESULTS: Percentages of neutrophils and eosinophils in the BALF of the EX group were higher (5.4 +/- 6.4% versus 0.9 +/- 1.2%) than the upper limits for normal horses (3-5%). BALF from the EX group (45.6 +/- 2.8 cells/microL of BALF) also displayed significantly (P = .017) higher total nucleated cell count. PAF bioactivity and the total protein concentration in the BALF were higher in the EX group (0.0683 +/- 0.076 versus 0.0056 +/- 0.007 340 : 380 nm ratio P = .0039, 0.36 +/- 0.30 versus 0.14 +/- 0.15 mg of proteins/mL of BALF P &lt; .001). Concentration of BALF hydroperoxides was higher in the EC group (104.7 +/- 80.0 versus 35.2 +/- 28.0 nmol/mg of proteins, P = .013) and catalase activity was higher in the EX group (0.24 +/- 0.16 versus 0.06 +/- 0.02 micromol H2O2/min/mg of proteins, P = .0021). Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis (P = .048) as well as production of superoxide anion (P = .0014) and hydrogen peroxide (P = .0011) were significantly lower in EX group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Further studies should be performed to elucidate the role of PAF in the pathophysiology of IAD. Its presence in bronchoalveolar fluid of young athletic horses makes it a potential therapeutic target to be investigated.",M2
20074623,"Platelet-activating factor-induced synaptic facilitation is associated with increased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activities in the rat hippocampal CA1 region.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is an important inflammatory lipid mediator affecting neural plasticity. In the present study, we demonstrated how PAF affects synaptic efficacy through activation of protein kinases in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. In cultured hippocampal neurons, 10 to 1000 nM PAF stimulated autophosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and phosphorylation of synapsin I and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS). In hippocampal CA1 slices, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) induced by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathways were significantly increased 10-50 min after exposure to 100 to 1000 nM PAF. Immunoblotting analysis showed that 100 nM PAF treatment for 10 or 50 min significantly and persistently increased CaMKII autophosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region. Increased protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) autophosphorylation was also seen at the same time point after PAF exposure. By contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation was slightly but significantly increased at 10 min after PAF exposure. Consistent with increased CaMKII autophosphorylation, AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) (Ser-831) phosphorylation as a CaMKII postsynaptic substrate significantly increased after 10 or 50 min of treatment, whereas synapsin I (Ser-603) phosphorylation as a presynaptic substrate increased at 10 min in the hippocampal CA1 region. Phosphorylation of MARCKS (Ser-152/156) and NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) (Ser-896) as PKCalpha substrates also significantly increased after 10 min but had not further increased by 50 min in the CA1 region. Increased of fEPSPs induced by PAF treatment completely and/or partly inhibited by KN93 and/or U0126 treatment. These results suggest that PAF induces synaptic facilitation through activation of CaMKII, PKC and ERK in the hippocampal CA1 region.",M2
20048657,"Local anesthetic effects on human neutrophil priming and activation.BACKGROUND: The anti-inflammatory effects of local anesthetics (LAs) are well documented. Local anesthetics in micromolar concentrations inhibit extracellular oxygen release in isolated neutrophils; the underlying mechanism seems to be an inhibition of leukocyte priming. It remains unclear, however, if first, these effects also can be observed in whole blood, and second, if the priming of other neutrophil functions is similarly attenuated by LAs. Furthermore, the effects of LAs on intracellular generation of oxidative species remain to be investigated. METHODS: Whole-blood samples from healthy volunteers were incubated for 0, 1, or 3 hrs with different concentrations (10 to 10 M) of either lidocaine, ropivacaine, QX314, or NaCl 0.9% as control. Dihydroethidium was added to quantify oxidative burst. Samples were primed with platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>, 10 M) and/or activated with formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (10 M) for 15 mins each. After staining for CD11b and lysis of erythrocytes, samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Priming of leukocytes is a relevant mechanism in whole blood. Platelet-activating factor stimulates the priming of oxidative burst and CD11b expression. Lidocaine up to millimolar concentrations did not affect the PAF priming and formyl-methyl-leucyl-phenylalanine activation of oxidative burst. The priming of CD11b expression and the priming and activation of changes in cell morphology were significantly attenuated by lidocaine. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species remains largely unaffected by LAs in clinical concentrations. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory effects of LAs do not interfere with the host defense.",M2
20041255,"Platelet activating factor stimulates arachidonic acid release in differentiated keratinocytes via arachidonyl non-selective phospholipase A2.Platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is known to be present in excess in psoriatic skin, but its exact role is uncertain. In the present study we demonstrate for the first time the role of group VI PLA(2) in PAF-induced arachidonic acid release in highly differentiated human keratinocytes. The group IValpha PLA(2) also participates in the release, while secretory PLA(2)s play a minor role. Two anti-inflammatory synthetic fatty acids, tetradecylthioacetic acid and tetradecylselenoacetic acid, are shown to interfere with signalling events upstream of group IValpha PLA(2) activation. In summary, our major novel finding is the involvement of the arachidonyl non-selective group VI PLA(2) in PAF-induced inflammatory responses.",M2
20016469,"Aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 induces mesangial cells to produce platelet-activating factor that mediates nephrin loss in cultured podocytes.The reaction of mesangial cells with aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 has been implicated in the etiology of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Tumor necrosis factor, which is assumed to mediate the interaction between mesangial cells and podocytes, also induces the expression of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>). In this study, we determined whether PAF affects the expression of nephrin (an adhesion molecule critical to glomerular permselectivity) and cytoskeletal F-actin organization in podocytes. We treated human mesangial cells with atypically glycosylated IgA1 either prepared in vitro or derived from the sera of patients with IgAN. We then prepared conditioned media from these cells and added them to cultured human podocytes in the presence of PAF receptor antagonists. Podocytes transfected to overexpress acetylhydrolase, the main catabolic enzyme of PAF, served as controls. Downregulation of nephrin expression and F-actin reorganization occurred when podocytes were cultured with mesangial cell-conditioned medium. Preincubation of podocytes with a PAF receptor antagonist prevented the loss and redistribution of nephrin. In control podocytes overexpressing acetylhydrolase, nephrin loss was abrogated. Our results suggest that atypically glycosylated IgA-induced PAF from mesangial cells is a mediator of podocyte changes, which, when more directly tested elsewhere, were found to be associated with proteinuria. Hence, it is possible that these in vitro findings may be relevant to the proteinuria of IgAN.",M2
19965607,"Significance of lipid mediators in corneal injury and repair.Corneal injury induces an inflammatory reaction and damages the sensory nerves that exert trophic influences in the corneal epithelium. Alterations in normal healing disrupt the integrity and function of the tissue with undesirable consequences, ranging from dry eye and loss of transparency to ulceration and perforation. Lipids play important roles in this complex process. Whereas lipid mediators such as platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and cyclooxygenease-2 metabolites contribute to tissue damage and neovascularization, other mediators, such as the lipoxygenase (LOX) derivatives from arachidonic acid, 12- and 15-hydroxy/hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and lipoxin A4, act as second messengers for epidermal growth factor to promote proliferation and repair. Stimulation of the cornea with pigment epithelial derived factor in the presence of docosahexaenoic acid gives rise to the synthesis of neuroprotectin D1, a derivative of LOX activity, and increases regeneration of corneal nerves. More knowledge about the role that lipids play in corneal wound healing can provide insight into the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating corneal injuries. PAF antagonists, lipoxins, and neuroprotectins can be effective therapeutic tools for maintaining the integrity of the cornea.",M2
19959817,"Signaling in TRPV1-induced platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in human esophageal epithelial cells.Transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) receptors were identified in human esophageal squamous epithelial cell line HET-1A by RT-PCR and by Western blot. In fura-2 AM-loaded cells, the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin caused a fourfold cytosolic calcium increase, supporting a role of TRPV1 as a capsaicin-activated cation channel. Capsaicin increased production of platelet activating factor (PAF), an important inflammatory mediator that acts as a chemoattractant and activator of immune cells. The increase was reduced by the p38 MAP kinase (p38) inhibitor SB203580, by the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA(2)) inhibitor AACOCF3, and by the lyso-PAF acetyltransferase inhibitor sanguinarin, indicating that capsaicin-induced PAF production may be mediated by activation of cPLA(2), p38, and lyso-PAF acetyltransferase. To establish a sequential signaling pathway, we examined the phosphorylation of p38 and cPLA(2) by Western blot. Capsaicin induced phosphorylation of p38 and cPLA(2). Capsaicin-induced p38 phosphorylation was not affected by AACOCF3. Conversely, capsaicin-induced cPLA(2) phosphorylation was blocked by SB203580, indicating that capsaicin-induced PAF production depends on sequential activation of p38 and cPLA(2). To investigate how p38 phosphorylation may result from TRPV1-mediated calcium influx, we examined a possible role of calmodulin kinase (CaM-K). p38 phosphorylation was stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187 and by capsaicin, and the response to both agonists was reduced by a CaM inhibitor and by CaM-KII inhibitors, indicating that calcium induced activation of CaM and CaM-KII results in P38 phosphorylation. Acetyl-CoA transferase activity increased in response to capsaicin and was inhibited by SB203580, indicating that p38 phosphorylation in turn causes activation of acetyl-CoA transferase to produce PAF. Thus epithelial cells produce PAF in response to TRPV1-mediated calcium elevation.",M2
19958112,"Functional analysis of platelet-activating factor in the retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal endothelial cells.PURPOSE: To investigate the function of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in cultured retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and choroidal endothelial (CE) cells. METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo expression of PAF-receptors (PAF-R) on both these cells was determined. The production of PAF by RPE cells was also determined. The effect of PAF on the proliferation, migration, permeability, and apoptosis of CE cells was examined, and the modulation of PAF on the VEGF level in RPE cells was assessed. RESULTS: PAF-R was present in both types of cells in vitro, as well as in RPE and choroid in vivo. Cultured RPE cells synthesized PAF. PAF stimulated CE cell migration and permeability but not the proliferation. PAF also increased the VEGF level in RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to VEGF, PAF stimulates CE cell migration and permeability. It also up-regulates VEGF level in RPE cells. PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization.",M2
19910525,"A model of the isolated perfused rat small intestine.Intestinal edema remains a serious clinical problem, and novel approaches to study its pathophysiology are needed. It was our aim to develop a long-term stable isolated perfused rat small bowel preparation permitting analysis of vascular, luminal, interstitial, and lymphatic compartments and to demonstrate the utility of this model by studying the effects of the proinflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>). A temperature-controlled chamber with an integrated balance was designed to perfuse isolated intestines through the mesenteric artery and the gut lumen. Steroids or oxygen carriers were not needed. Functional and morphological integrity of the tissue was preserved for several hours as confirmed by oxygen consumption, venous lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, arterial and venous pH, lactose digestion and galactose uptake, intravascular and luminal pressures, maintained fluid homeostasis, gut motility, and quantitative light microscopic analysis. Administration of PAF caused typical effects such as vasoconstriction, gut atony, and loss of galactose uptake. PAF also elicited a transient loss of 20% of the perfusate liquid from the mesenteric vascular bed, two-thirds of which were transferred to the lumen. All these responses were entirely reversible. This new model provides detailed insights into the physiology of the small intestine and will allow to study fundamental processes such as fluid homeostasis, barrier functions, transport mechanisms, and immune responses in this organ. Using this model, here we show a dramatic and yet reversible response of the rat small bowel to PAF, suggesting luminal water clearance as a novel safety factor in the intestine that may be of clinical relevance.",M2
19894037,"Inhibitors of TRP channels reveal stimulus-dependent differential activation of Ca2+ influx pathways in human neutrophil granulocytes.A pharmacological characterization of Ca(2+) influx pathways in neutrophil granulocytes is problematic because of the lack of specific inhibitors. The activation of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2 (TRPM2) channels by intracellular adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR), well characterized in neutrophils, is reportedly inhibited by 8-bromo-ADPR (8Br-ADPR). TRPM2 is blocked by N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA) interfering with the pore, but ACA is as well effective on other transient receptor potential channels, especially transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels. We wished to analyze whether ACA and 8Br-ADPR were suitable probes to demonstrate that different Ca(2+) entry pathways are activated in human neutrophil granulocytes by the receptor-dependent stimuli N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) and platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and the receptor-independent thapsigargin. Ca(2+)-influx-related increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were calculated by comparing aliquots of fluo-3-loaded neutrophils in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca(2+). Moreover, Mn(2+) quenching was used in fura-2-loaded cells. We compared 8Br-ADPR with ACA. 8Br-ADPR was exclusively effective when Ca(2+) influx (or Mn(2+) quenching) was induced by fMLP; it did not affect influx when PAF or thapsigargin was the stimulus. ACA inhibited Ca(2+) influx significantly more strongly when this was induced by PAF than by fMLP. Moreover, it reduced thapsigargin-induced Ca(2+) influx. The contribution of TRPM2 to Ca(2+) influx in neutrophils strongly depends on the stimulus; it is sizeable in the case of fMLP and minimal in the case of PAF. PAF induces Ca(2+) entry pathways different from TRPM2; the inhibition by ACA suggests the contribution of channels of the TRPC family.",M2
19889092,"The antifungal protein <e>PAF</e> interferes with PKC/MPK and cAMP/PKA signalling of Aspergillus nidulans.The Penicillium chrysogenum antifungal protein PAF inhibits polar growth and induces apoptosis in Aspergillus nidulans. We report here that two signalling cascades are implicated in its antifungal activity. PAF activates the cAMP/protein kinase A (Pka) signalling cascade. A pkaA deletion mutant exhibited reduced sensitivity towards PAF. This was substantiated by the use of pharmacological modulators: PAF aggravated the effect of the activator 8-Br-cAMP and partially relieved the repressive activity of caffeine. Furthermore, the Pkc/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mpk) signalling cascade mediated basal resistance to PAF, which was independent of the small GTPase RhoA. Non-functional mutations of both genes resulted in hypersensitivity towards PAF. PAF did not increase MpkA phosphorylation or induce enzymes involved in the remodelling of the cell wall, which normally occurs in response to activators of the cell wall integrity pathway. Notably, PAF exposure resulted in actin gene repression and a deregulation of the chitin deposition at hyphal tips of A. nidulans, which offers an explanation for the morphological effects evoked by PAF and which could be attributed to the interconnection of the two signalling pathways. Thus, PAF represents an excellent tool to study signalling pathways in this model organism and to define potential fungal targets to develop new antifungals.",M2
19882198,"Persistency and pathway of isoflurane-induced inhibition of superoxide production by neutrophils.BACKGROUND: Our previous work has demonstrated that treatment with isoflurane has a preconditioning-like inhibitory effect on superoxide production (SOP) by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The current objectives were to determine persistency of this effect and to clarify where in the signalling pathway this inhibition of SOP occurred. The latter was accomplished using two receptor-dependent neutrophil agonists, platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), and two receptor-independent neutrophil stimuli, the protein-kinase C stimulator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the calcium ionophore, A23187. METHODS: Arterial blood samples were obtained from eight dogs under baseline condition (conscious state), during isoflurane (1 MAC) administration, and 24 and 48 hr post-isoflurane (also in conscious state). Neutrophils were isolated and stimulated with 1 muM concentrations of PAF, fMLP, PMA, and A23187. SOP was measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Isoflurane administration caused (1) an approximate 50% decrease in SOP during PAF or fMLP (P &lt; 0.01 vs baseline), which remained evident from 24 to 48 hr following isoflurane; (2) an initial 29% decrease in SOP during PMA (P &lt; 0.05 vs baseline), which returned to baseline by 24 hr following isoflurane; and (3) no change in SOP during A23187 (P &gt; 0.05 vs baseline). CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane administration caused prolonged (from 24 to 48 hr) decreases in agonist-induced SOP by neutrophils. This effect involved inhibition at site(s) in the signalling pathway upstream from protein kinase C. The current findings suggest that the intraoperative use of isoflurane may result in an extended impairment to the antibacterial host defense mechanism and that neutrophil inhibition may play a role in the delayed tissue protection afforded by treatment with volatile anesthetics.",M2
19843712,"Toll-like receptor ligands induce polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration: key roles for leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor.Activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulation at infection sites are critical events of host defense. The involvement of leukotriene (LT) B(4) and platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in TLR ligand-induced activation of inflammatory cell functions is essentially unknown. Using an in vitro model of human PMN migration through human endothelial cell monolayers, we demonstrate that prototypic ligands of TLR1/2, 2/6, 3, 4, 5, and 7/8 promote PMN migration, an effect markedly inhibited by 3 LTB(4) receptor antagonists (70-80% inhibition at 100 nM compared to vehicle-treated cells), 3 PAF receptor antagonists (20-50% inhibition at 10 nM), 3 LT biosynthesis inhibitors (75-85% inhibition at 100 nM), and 1 cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha) inhibitor (90% inhibition at 1 microM). Accordingly, selected TLR ligands caused Ser-505-phosphorylation of cPLA(2)alpha and measurable LTB(4) and PAF biosynthesis in the transmigration assay. As negative controls, interleukin-8- and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-elicited migration in vitro was not inhibited either by an LTB(4) receptor antagonist or by the cPLA(2)alpha inhibitor. Finally, LTB(4) and PAF receptor antagonists inhibited (up to approximately 65% at optimal doses) TLR ligand-induced PMN infiltration in the mouse air-pouch model. These studies unravel the critical involvement of de novo LTB(4) and PAF biosynthesis in PMN migration elicited by TLR ligands.",M2
19829299,"Agents that reverse UV-Induced immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis affect DNA repair.UV exposure induces skin cancer, in part, by inducing immune suppression. Repairing DNA damage, neutralizing the activity of cis-urocanic acid, and reversing oxidative stress abrogate UV-induced immune suppression and skin cancer induction, suggesting that DNA, UCA, and lipid photo-oxidation serve as UV photoreceptors. What is not clear is whether signaling through each of these different photoreceptors activates independent pathways to induce biological effects or whether there is a common checkpoint where these pathways converge. Here, we show that agents known to reverse photocarcinogenesis and photoimmune suppression, such as platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists, regulate DNA repair. Pyrimidine dimer repair was accelerated in UV-irradiated mice injected with PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), as measured by unscheduled DNA synthesis, was accelerated by PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. Injecting PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists into UV-irradiated Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A-deficient mice, which lack the enzymes responsible for NER, did not accelerate photoproduct repair. Similarly, UV-induced formation of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine was reduced by PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists. We conclude that PAF and 5-HT receptor antagonists accelerate DNA repair caused by UV radiation, which prevents immune suppression and interferes with photocarcinogenesis.",M2
19827129,"Platelet-activating factor interaction with the human erythrocyte membrane.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a soluble signal messenger present in blood at nanomolar concentration. PAF has a wide spectrum of biological activities and is produced by and effective in different cell types. Owing to its important physiological role, we wanted to characterize membrane intercalation and interaction of PAF-16 (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) by studying its capacity to induce during short-term incubations at high concentrations cell shape alterations, phosphatidylserine exposure, and hemolysis in human erythrocytes. Our results showed that PAF-16 at micromolar concentrations rapidly (&lt;or=1 min) induces stable but wash-sensitive echinocytosis and hemolysis, but no substantial phosphatidylserine exposure. In conclusion, our study characterizes PAF-16 as a highly membrane partitioning non-permeable molecule accumulating in the outer membrane leaflet. These membrane interacting properties of PAF should, also at physiological concentrations, be important part of its nature as a membrane affector molecule.",M2
19773578,"A regulatory role of LPCAT1 in the synthesis of inflammatory lipids, <e>PAF</e> and LPC, in the retina of diabetic mice.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) are potent inflammatory lipids. Elevated levels of PAF and LPC are associated with the onset of diabetic retinopathy and neurodegeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such defects remain elusive. LPCAT1 is a newly reported lysophospholipid acyltransferase implicated in the anti-inflammatory response by its role in conversion of LPC to PC. Intriguingly, the LPCAT1 enzyme also catalyzes the synthesis of PAF from lyso-PAF with use of acetyl-CoA as a substrate. The present studies investigated regulatory roles of LPCAT1 in the synthesis of inflammatory lipids during the onset of diabetes. Our work shows that LPCAT1 plays an important role in the inactivation of PAF by catalyzing the synthesis of alkyl-PC, an inactivated form of PAF with use of acyl-CoA and lyso-PAF as substrates. In support of a role of LPCAT1 in anti-inflammatory responses in diabetic retinopathy, LPCAT1 is most abundantly expressed in the retina. Moreover, LPCAT1 mRNA levels and acyltransferase activity toward lyso-PAF and LPC were significantly downregulated in retina and brain tissues in response to the onset of diabetes in Ins2(Akita) and db/db mice, mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Conversely, treatment of db/db mice with rosiglitazone, an antidiabetes compound, significantly upregulated LPCAT1 mRNA levels concurrently with increased acyltransferase activity in the retina and brain. Collectively, these findings identified a novel regulatory role of LPCAT1 in catalyzing the inactivation of inflammatory lipids in the retina of diabetic mice.",M2
19744985,"Posaconazole attenuates leukotriene B4 release and uptake of calcium by chemoattractant-activated human neutrophils: a potential strategy to control neutrophil-mediated inflammation.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the neutrophil-targeted anti-inflammatory potential of posaconazole (0.1-5 microM, equivalent to 0.7-3.9 mg/L) by measuring the effects of this agent on the release of leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) and store-operated uptake of Ca(2+) following stimulation of human neutrophils with platelet-activating factor (200 nM). METHODS: LTB(4) release and uptake of Ca(2+) by the cells were measured using an enzyme immunoassay and fura-2/AM-based spectrofluorimetric procedures, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of neutrophils with posaconazole resulted in dose-related attenuation of <e>PAF</e>-activated release of LTB(4) and influx of Ca(2+), which attained statistical significance at 1 microM of the antimycotic. CONCLUSIONS: Although primarily an antimycotic, posaconazole possesses secondary anti-inflammatory activities, which may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of this agent in patients with sepsis.",M2
19716589,"Treatment of sperm with platelet-activating factor does not improve intrauterine insemination outcome in unselected cases of mild male factor infertility: a prospective double-blind randomized crossover study.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of sperm treatment with exogenous platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) on intrauterine insemination (IUI) clinical pregnancy rate in cases of mild male factor infertility. PAF is a phospholipid mediator, which is present in human sperm. METHODS: The study was performed in the Assisted Reproduction Unit of the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Athens, Aretaieion Hospital, Athens, Greece, and included 92 couples who presented with mild male factor infertility-all candidates for IUI. A maximum of 4 IUI cycles per couple with or without exogenous PAF treatment were performed and the main outcome measure was the clinical pregnancy rate (pregnancies confirmed by ultrasonography per 100 cycles). RESULTS: The overall clinical pregnancy rate after a maximum of 4 IUI cycles was comparable in cases with and without sperm treatment with PAF (12.24% vs 11.11%). Addition or exclusion of PAF sperm treatment in the same patients did not significantly alter the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The generalized use of exogenous PAF for the preparation of sperm in unselected cases of mild male infertility does not improve the clinical outcome of IUI.",M2
19695175,"[Influence of intensive insulin therapy on the intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction in rats with sepsis]OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of intensive insulin therapy on the intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction of rats suffering from sepsis. METHODS: The sepsis model of rat was reproduced by cecal ligation and puncture. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control group, sepsis group, and insulin treatment group (n =16 in each group). The intestinal tissue was harvested in the experimental groups before and 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after insulin administration. Platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and thromboxane (TXA(2)) in the intestine were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The levels of PAF, PGI and TXA(2) were significantly elevated in sepsis group at 3 hours, and peaked at 6 hours, then decreased gradually. At each time point they were higher in sepsis group compared with that of control group (all P&lt;0.05), especially TXA(2), which was more evident, while PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio showed a lowering. In contrast, PAF, PGI(2) and TXA(2) were significantly decreased in insulin treatment group compared with the sepsis group, especially TXA(2), which was more evident ( all P&lt;0.05), but PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio showed an elevation. CONCLUSION: Insulin plays an important role in amelioration of microcirculatory dysfunction in sepsis. Through improving the disorder of PGI(2)/TXA(2)system and antagonising the expression of PAF, insulin alleviates vasospasm, inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombosis, thus protecting the function of intestine.",M2
19689381,"The implication of platelet activating factor in cancer growth and metastasis: potent beneficial role of <e>PAF</e>-inhibitors and antioxidants.Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Europe and United States. New blood vessel formation penetrating into solid tumors seems to be required for their growth and metastasis. Several protein growth factors can induce endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, through signal transduction cascades that result in the production of several inflammatory mediators and lipid second messengers such as prostaglandins and Platelet Activating Factor (PAF). PAF is a potent mediator of inflammation that is implicated in several inflammatory pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and renal diseases, allergy, AIDS, cancer etc. It exerts its biological activities through G-protein-coupled receptors. The presence of PAF in the microenvironment of tumors may be due to its synthesis from circulating and / or cancer cells. Moreover, cancer cells and activated endothelial cells expose PAF-receptor on their membrane surface. PAF binding on its receptor induces several pathways that result in the onset and development of tumor induced angiogenesis and metastasis. PAF-receptor antagonists have exhibited promising results in vitro and in vivo as anti-angiogenic molecules in several cancer cells and tumors. A dietary profile reach in antioxidants and PAF-inhibitors (such as the Mediterranean Diet) may provide beneficial preventive and protective effects against development, growth and metastatic manifestations of cancer cells, through either their inhibition of PAF activity and / or its biosynthesis. The clarification of factors that may down regulate pathologically increased PAF-levels in a tumor microenvironment may also contribute to the planning of a potent nontoxic preventive and therapeutic approach against cancer.",M2

19652714,"The novel role of platelet-activating factor in protecting mice against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock.BACKGROUND: Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) has been long believed to be associated with many pathophysiological processes during septic shock. Here we present novel activities for PAF in protecting mice against LPS-mediated endotoxic shock. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In vivo PAF treatment immediately after LPS challenge markedly improved the survival rate against mortality from endotoxic shock. Administration of PAF prominently attenuated LPS-induced organ injury, including profound hypotension, excessive polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and severe multiple organ failure. In addition, PAF treatment protects against LPS-induced lymphocytes apoptosis. These protective effects of PAF was correlated with significantly decreases in the production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-12, and IFN-gamma, while increasing production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that PAF may protect mice against endotoxic shock via a complex mechanism involving modulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators.",M2
19645346,"Effect of platelet-activating factor on motility, plasmalemma integrity, the process of capacitation and acrosome reaction of fresh and cryopreserved boar spermatozoa.The aim of the present study was to establish the effects of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) on selected movement parameters, plasmalemma integrity, capacitation process and acrosome reaction in cryopreserved boar spermatozoa. A positive effect of PAF addition to cryopreserved semen on sperm motility was demonstrated, particularly with the application of phospholipid concentration of 1 x 10(-6)M-1 x 10(-5)M. A moderate induction of plasmalemma damage of cryopreserved spermatozoa was observed when PAF was used at a low concentration (1 x 10(-8)M-1 x 10(-7)M). The rate at which PAF induced the process of capacitation was inversely proportional to its concentration in the sample (the highest for the concentration of 1 x 10(-8)M, and the lowest at 1 x 10(-5)M). In turn, the strongest induction of acrosome reaction of spermatozoa was observed in samples with the addition of PAF at a concentration of 1 x 10(-7)M. The results obtained suggest that the application of PAF supplement to post-thawed boar semen can be used as a laboratory test of the ability of spermatozoa to induce the acrosome reaction.",M2
19620302,"Caveolae facilitate but are not essential for platelet-activating factor-mediated calcium mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.Certain proteins, including receptors and signaling molecules, are known to be enriched in caveolae and lipid rafts. Caveolin-1, the major structural protein of caveolae, specifically interacts with many signaling molecules and, thus, caveolae and lipid rafts are often seen as preassembled signaling platforms. A potential binding site for caveolin-1 is present in the platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) sequence, and many downstream signaling components of PAFR activation preferentially localize in caveolae. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the PAFR was localized in caveolae/lipid raft domains and, if so, what would be the significance of such localization for PAFR signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that PAFR localizes within membrane microdomains, in close proximity to caveolin-1 in living cells, with potential interaction through a caveolin-1-binding sequence in the PAFR C terminus. Caveolin-1, however, is not essential for PAFR localization in lipid rafts. Disruption of caveolae/lipid rafts with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin markedly reduced <e>PAF</e>-triggered inositol phosphate production and cytosolic calcium flux, suggesting that PAFR signaling through the Galphaq protein was critically dependent on integrity of lipid rafts and/or caveolae. Interestingly, whereas in caveolin-1-expressing cells lipid raft disruption markedly decreased PAFR-mediated activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, in cells lacking caveolae, such as leukocytes, lipid raft disruption had either the same inhibitory effect (Ramos B cells) or no effect (monocytes) on PAFR capacity to signal through the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, PAFR appears to localize within caveolae or lipid rafts in different cell types, and this location may be important for specific signaling events.",M2
19603543,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate in the plasma compartment regulates basal and inflammation-induced vascular leak in mice.Maintenance of vascular integrity is critical for homeostasis, and temporally and spatially regulated vascular leak is a central feature of inflammation. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can regulate endothelial barrier function, but the sources of the S1P that provide this activity in vivo and its importance in modulating different inflammatory responses are unknown. We report here that mutant mice engineered to selectively lack S1P in plasma displayed increased vascular leak and impaired survival after anaphylaxis, administration of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) or histamine, and exposure to related inflammatory challenges. Increased leak was associated with increased interendothelial cell gaps in venules and was reversed by transfusion with wild-type erythrocytes (which restored plasma S1P levels) and by acute treatment with an agonist for the S1P receptor 1 (S1pr1). S1pr1 agonist did not protect wild-type mice from PAF-induced leak, consistent with plasma S1P levels being sufficient for S1pr1 activation in wild-type mice. However, an agonist for another endothelial cell Gi-coupled receptor, Par2, did protect wild-type mice from PAF-induced vascular leak, and systemic treatment with pertussis toxin prevented rescue by Par2 agonist and sensitized wild-type mice to leak-inducing stimuli in a manner that resembled the loss of plasma S1P. Our results suggest that the blood communicates with blood vessels via plasma S1P to maintain vascular integrity and regulate vascular leak. This pathway prevents lethal responses to leak-inducing mediators in mouse models.",M2
19601878,"Platelet activating factor/platelet activating factor receptor pathway as a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases.Platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation that is released early in inflammation by a variety of cell types. PAF acts largely by binding to its receptor, PAF-R, a G-protein coupled receptor found on a variety of cells, including cells of the immune system. PAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic conditions, but its role in autoimmune conditions has been less extensively investigated. Here, we review the accumulating evidence for the role of PAF/PAF-R pathway in autoimmune diseases. We describe studies showing up-regulation of PAF-R in inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and review the evidence from the use of PAF-R antagonists. We describe results of experimental models of inflammatory diseases that point to a role for PAF/PAF-R pathway including those using PAF-R antagonists and those employing PAF-R knockout mice and knockout mice for cytosolic phospholipase2. Recent experiments from our laboratory show that PAF/PAF-R pathway may influence T cell responses and favour the Th17 phenotype (in which T cells produce tissue destructive proinflammatory cytokine IL-17). The PAF/PAF-R pathway is a promising target for pharmacological intervention in autoimmune diseases.",M2
19565634,"Platelet-activating factor-stimulated production of reactive oxygen species in ovarian granulosa cells from periovulatory follicles.The platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a proinflammatory lipid present in the fluid of ovarian Graafian follicle. Ovarian blockage of the PAF receptor (PAFr) reduces ovulations in the rat whereas underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Mural granulosa cells (MGC) were mechanically isolated from the theca interna of bovine periovulatory follicle. The mRNA abundance for PAFr, progesterone receptor and cyclooxygenase-2 were measured by real-time PCR. Cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration was assayed by microscopy using Fura-2 AM as indicator, 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-isoPGF(2alpha)) by an ELISA kit. Fluorescent products arising from intracellular oxidation of hydroethidine (HE) and dihydrorhodamine (DHR) were quantified by flow cytometry. The cells expressed PAFr mRNA and PAFr protein and responded to cPAF (nonhydrolyzable form of PAF) with a pulsating increase in Ca2+, demonstrating functional PAFr. Elevation of Ca2+ was reversed by WEB-2086, an inverse PAFr agonist. cPAF elevated the level of 8-isoPGF(2alpha) in the medium of MGC cultured with luteinizing hormone (LH). cPAF alone had no significant influence on the oxidation of HE and DHR, or 8-isoPGF(2alpha) level. In MGC from vital periovulatory follicle, PAF and LH signaling plays an important role in regulating the production of excessive oxidants. Blockage of PAFr seems to interfere with these regulatory processes essential for ovulation.",M2
19555682,"Blood-brain barrier breakdown by <e>PAF</e> and protection by XQ-1H due to antagonism of PAF effects.Hypoxia and reoxygenation set in motion a series of events, including blood-brain barrier breakdown. We examined the content and effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), which was increased in the rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (RBMECs) during hypoxia and reoxygenation. MTT method was used to assay cell damage; ELISA analysis was used to estimate PAF release after hypoxia and reoxygenation injury; and RT-PCR and Western blotting method were used to assess gene and protein expressions of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in RBMECs under PAF damage. PAF affected intracellular free Ca(2+) levels, increasing [Ca(2+)](i), which caused up-regulation of iNOS. We also examined the blood-brain barrier protective effect of XQ-1H, a novel ginkgolide B derivative. Pretreatment with XQ-1H (10 microM and 3 microM) for 24 h significantly antagonized PAF receptor and inhibited the increase in intracellular calcium concentration and the up-regulation of iNOS in response to PAF under hypoxia and reoxygenation in vitro.",M2
19553604,"Activation of a chloride channel by a trophic ligand is required for development of the mouse preimplantation embryo in vitro.Platelet-activating factor (1-o-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-gylcero-3-phosphocholine [<e>PAF</e>]) is one of several autocrine trophic factors supporting the development of the preimplantation embryo. PAF acts on the embryo to induce receptor-mediated intracellular calcium (Ca(2+))(i) transients, and these coincide with a marked membrane hyperpolarization. Patch-clamp analysis of 2-cell embryos showed that these Ca(2+)(i) transients resulted in an outward membrane current. The present study characterizes this current and assesses its role in embryo development. The outward current was dependent upon the presence of anions in the extracellular medium and occurred as a consequence of the PAF-induced Ca(2+)(i) transients. The anion current induced by PAF was inhibited by niflumic acid (NFA), a selective blocker of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels, but this drug did not block the PAF-induced Ca(2+)(i) transients. Voltage ramp analysis showed that the Cl(-) conductance was outwardly rectifying and inactivated at holding potentials more positive than +30 mV. Culture in NFA or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (a broad-specificity anion channel blocker) from the zygote stage significantly reduced development to blastocysts, with most arresting at the 4-cell and 8-cell stages. Niflumic acid exposure only from the zygote to the late 2-cell stage also reduced the subsequent development to blastocysts. By contrast, treatment from the late 2-cell stage or the 8-cell stage had no effect on development to the blastocyst stage. This study demonstrates the activation of a Ca(2+)-sensitive Cl(-) channel in the 2-cell embryo by PAF and shows that this current activity during the zygote to 2-cell stage is required for normal embryo development in vitro.",M2

19548361,"Effects of acrolein on leukotriene biosynthesis in human neutrophils.Acrolein is a toxic, highly reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde that is present in high concentrations in cigarette smoke. In the current study, the effect of acrolein on eicosanoid synthesis in stimulated human neutrophils was examined. Eicosanoid synthesis in neutrophils was initiated by priming with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and subsequent stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) products in addition to small amounts of cyclooxygenase (COX) products were detected using LC/MS/MS. A dose-dependent decrease in the formation of 5-LO products was observed in GM-CSF/fMLP-stimulated neutrophils when acrolein (0-50 microM) was present with almost complete inhibition at &gt; or = 25 microM acrolein. The production of COX products was not affected by acrolein in these cells. The effect of acrolein was examined on key parts of the eicosanoid pathway, such as arachidonic acid release, intracellular calcium ion concentration, and adenosine production. In addition, the direct effect of acrolein on 5-LO enzymatic activity was probed using a recombinant enzyme. Some of these factors were affected by acrolein but did not completely explain the almost complete inhibition of 5-LO product formation in GM-CSF/fMLP-treated cells with acrolein. In addition, the effect of acrolein on different stimuli that initiate the 5-LO pathway [platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>)/fMLP, GM-CSF/PAF, opsonized zymosan, and A23187] was examined. Acrolein had no significant effect on the leukotriene production in neutrophils stimulated with PAF/fMLP, GM-CSF/ PAF, or OPZ. Additionally, 50% inhibition of the 5-LO pathway was observed in A23187-stimulated neutrophils. Our results suggest that acrolein has a profound effect on the 5-LO pathway in neutrophils, which may have implications in disease states, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other pulmonary disease, where both activated neutrophils and acrolein are present.",M2
19524267,"Lipoxin a(4) attenuates microvascular fluid leak during inflammation.BACKGROUND: The release of proinflammatory cytokines during inflammation disturbs the endothelial barrier and can initiate significant intravascular volume loss. Proinflammatory cytokines also induce the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as lipoxin, which promote the resolution of inflammation. Our hypothesis is that lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) reverses the increased microvascular fluid leak observed during inflammatory conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microvascular fluid leak (L(p)) was measured in rat mesenteric venules using a micro-cannulation technique. L(p) was measured under the following conditions: (1) LXA(4) (100 nM) alone (n = 5), (2) LXA(4) (100 nM) administered after endothelial hyperpermeability induced by a continuous perfusion of 10 nM platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) (n = 5), (3) LXA(4) (100 nM) perfused after inflammation induced by a systemic bolus of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 5), and (4) LXA(4) (100 nM) perfused after LPS-induced inflammation during inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (n = 4). RESULTS: LXA(4) alone slightly increased L(p) from baseline (L(p)-baseline = 1.05 +/- 0.03, L(p)-LXA(4) = 1.55 +/- 0.04; P &lt; 0.0001). PAF increased L(p) 4-fold (L(p)-baseline = 1.20 +/- 0.10, L(p)-PAF = 4.49 +/- 0.95; P &lt; 0.0001). LXA(4) administration after PAF decreased L(p) 66% versus PAF alone (from 4.49 +/- 0.95 to 1.54 +/- 0.13; P = 0.0004). LPS-induced inflammation increased L(p) over 2-fold (L(p)-baseline = 1.05 +/- 0.03, L(p)-LPS = 2.27 +/- 0.13; P &lt; 0.0001). LXA(4) administration after LPS decreased L(p) 42% versus LPS alone (from 2.27 +/- 0.13 to 1.31 +/- 0.05; P &lt; 0.0001). The effect of c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibition during LPS-induced inflammation attenuated the decrease in leak cause by LXA(4) by 51% (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: After either LPS or PAF, LXA(4) attenuated the intravascular volume loss caused by these inflammatory mediators. The activity of LXA(4) may be partly mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. These data support an anti-inflammatory role for LXA(4) and suggests a potential pharmacologic role for LXA(4) during inflammation.",M2
19494504,"Intracellular protein phosphorylation in eosinophils and the functional relevance in cytokine production.BACKGROUND: Eosinophils play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Thus, it is of paramount importance to investigate the mechanism of eosinophil activation. Although a number of factors including cytokines/chemokines activate eosinophils, the potency of each stimulus to phosphorylate intracellular molecules and activate eosinophils remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we performed inclusive analyses of protein phosphorylation in eosinophils and studied the functional relevance of such phosphorylation in cytokine production. METHODS: Blood eosinophils were purified using Percoll and anti-CD16 antibody-coated magnetic beads. Purified eosinophils were stimulated with various stimuli. The eosinophil lysates were subjected to phosphoprotein analysis using the Luminex system. In some of these experiments, we studied the effect of a few signaling inhibitors on cytokine production from eosinophils. RESULTS: We found that several factors such as IL-5, eotaxin, platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), and PGD2 phosphorylated Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in the eosinophils. Because eotaxin most potently induced the production of various cytokines, we performed the inhibition study using eotaxin-stimulated eosinophils. Eotaxin-induced production of IL-1beta, IL-6, and MIP-1beta was significantly reduced by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In contrast, the GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 blocked only IL-1beta production from the eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules, we could quantify the potency of various stimuli that activate eosinophils. We are the first to demonstrate the role of GSK-3 in cytokine production from eosinophils. The Luminex system aids in examining the mechanism of eosinophil activation.",M2
19513187,"Human conjunctival epithelial cell responses to platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>): signal transduction and release of proinflammatory cytokines.PURPOSE: The aims of the study were to characterize the signal transduction responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF) and to monitor the downstream effects of PAF on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in human conjunctival epithelial cells (HCECs). METHODS: The generation of inositol phosphates ([(3)H]IPs) from [(3)H]phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and the mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) were evaluated using ion exchange chromatography and Fura-2 fluorescence techniques, respectively. The production of the cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) from PAF-stimulated HCECs was quantified using specific ELISA assays. Specific PAF antagonists were used to study the pharmacological aspects of PAF actions in HCECs. RESULTS: PAF (100 nM) maximally stimulated PI turnover in HCECs by 2.3+/-0.02 fold (n=21) above basal levels and with a potency (EC(50)) of 5.9+/-1.7 nM (n=4). PAF or its stabilized analog, methyl carbamyl (mc)PAF (EC(50)=0.8 nM), rapidly mobilized [Ca(2+)](i), which peaked within 30-60 s and remained elevated for 3 min. PAF (10 nM-1 microM) stimulated the release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, 1.4-3.5 fold above basal levels. The effects of PAF (100 nM) on PI turnover and [Ca(2+)](i) were potently antagonized by the PAF antagonists, 1-o-hexadecyl-2-o-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho (N,N,N-trimethyl) hexanolamine (IC(50)=0.69 microM; K(i)=38 nM), methyl 2-(phenylthio)ethyl-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-pyridine-3,5-dicsrboxylate (PCA-42481; IC(50)=0.89 microM; K(i)=50 nM), rac-3-(N-octadecylcarbomoyl)-2-methoxy) propyl-(2-thiazolioethyl) phosphate (CV-3988; IC(50)=13 microM; K(i)=771 nM), and (+/-)-cis-3,5-dimethyl-2-(3-pyridyl)thiazolidin-4-one HCl (SM-10661; IC(50)=14 microM; K(i)=789 nM [n=3 for each antagonist]). PAF-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF from HCECs was also blocked by these PAF antagonists (IC(50)=4.6- 8.6 microM). CONCLUSIONS: HCECs respond to PAF by generating IPs, mobilizing [Ca(2+)](i), and then secreting cytokines into the extracellular medium. These results suggest that HCECs may be key target cells for the PAF released from conjunctival mast cells following ocular allergic reactions. Therefore, HCECs in culture represent suitable in vitro models for the investigation of the role of PAF in human ocular allergic and inflammatory diseases and for the discovery of therapeutically useful PAF antagonists.",M2
19486886,"GM2 activator protein inhibits platelet activating factor signaling in rats.Platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), an endogenous bioactive phospholipid, has been documented as a pivotal mediator in the inflammatory cascade underlying the pathogenesis of many diseases including necrotizing enterocolitis. Much effort has been directed towards finding an effective in vivo inhibitor of PAF signaling. Here, we report that a small, highly stable, lysosomal lipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) is able to inhibit the inflammatory processes otherwise initiated by PAF in a rat model of necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on behavioral observations, gross anatomical observations at necropsy, histopathology and immunocytochemistry, the administration of recombinant GM2AP inhibits the devastating gastrointestinal necrosis resulting from the injection of rats with LPS and PAF. Recombinant GM2AP treatment not only markedly decrease tissue destruction, but also helped to maintain tight junction integrity at the gastrointestinal level as judged by contiguous Zonula Occludens-1 staining of the epithelial layer lining the crypts.",M2

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of NF-kappaB activation and the role of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit in PAF-induced shock and acute bowel injury. NF-kappaB p50-deficient mice and wild-type mice were anesthetized and tracheotomized, and their carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure monitoring, blood sampling, and PAF administration. For determination of bowel injury, shock, and survival, PAF (2.2 microg/kg, intra-arterially, i.a.) was injected. Two hours later, animals were euthanized, and their small intestines were removed for histological examination. For biochemical studies, PAF (1.5 microg/kg i.a.) was administered and the small intestine removed after 15-60 min. We found that PAF induced an increase in p105 processing within 30 min, but there were no changes in the levels of the NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins IkappaBalpha and beta. NF-kappaB p50-deficient mice were protected against PAF-induced mortality, shock, intestinal hypoperfusion, and injury compared with wild-type animals. We also found that p50-deficient mice had decreased gene expression of CXCL2 and TNF and a decrease in CXCL2 protein production compared with wild-type mice. Our study suggests that PAF increases the processing of NF-kappaB p105 into p50, with upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to PAF-induced systemic inflammatory response and acute bowel injury.",M2

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator in diverse biological and pathophysiological processes. Here we show that PAF promoted a three-fold increase on ecto-protein kinase and a three-fold increase on the secreted kinase activity of L. tropica live promastigotes. When casein was added to the reaction medium, along with PAF, there was a four-fold increase on the ecto-kinase activity. When live L. tropica promastigotes were pre-incubated for 30 min in the presence of PAF-plus casein, a six-fold increase on the secreted kinase activity was observed. Also, a protein released from L. tropica promastigotes reacted with polyclonal antibodies for the mammalian CK2 alpha catalytic subunit. Furthermore, in vitro mouse macrophage infection by L. tropica was doubled when promastigotes were pre-treated for 2 h with PAF. Similar results were obtained when the interaction was performed in the presence of purified CK2 or casein. TBB and DRB, CK2 inhibitors, reversed PAF enhancement of macrophage infection by L. tropica. WEB 2086, a competitive PAF antagonist, reversed all PAF effects here described. This study shows for the first time that PAF promotes the activation of two isoforms of CK2, secreted and membrane-bound, correlating these activities to infection of mouse macrophages.",M2
19432589,"Post-ischaemic activation of kinases in the pre-conditioning-like cardioprotective effect of the platelet-activating factor.AIM: Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) triggers cardiac pre-conditioning against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The actual protection of ischaemic pre-conditioning occurs in the reperfusion phase. Therefore, we studied in this phase the kinases involved in PAF-induced pre-conditioning. METHODS: Langendorff-perfused rat hearts underwent 30 min of ischaemia and 2 h of reperfusion (group 1, control). Before ischaemia, group 2 hearts were perfused for 19 min with PAF (2 x 10(-11) M); groups 3-5 hearts were co-infused during the initial 20 min of reperfusion, with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine (5 x 10(-6) M) or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (5 x 10(-5) M) and atractyloside (2 x 10(-5) M), a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opener respectively. Phosphorylation of PKCepsilon, PKB/Akappat, GSK-3beta and ERK1/2 at the beginning of reperfusion was also checked. Left ventricular pressure and infarct size were determined. RESULTS: PAF pre-treatment reduced infarct size (33 +/- 4% vs. 64 +/- 5% of the area at risk of control hearts) and improved pressure recovery. PAF pre-treatment enhanced the phosphorylation/activation of PKCepsilon, PKB/Akappat and the phosphorylation/inactivation of GSK-3beta at reperfusion. Effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation were not consistent. Infarct-sparing effect and post-ischaemic functional improvement induced by PAF pre-treatment were abolished by post-ischaemic infusion of either chelerythrine, LY294002 or atractyloside. CONCLUSIONS: The cardioprotective effect exerted by PAF pre-treatment involves activation of PKC and PI3K in post-ischaemic phases and might be mediated by the prevention of mPTP opening in reperfusion via GSK-3beta inactivation.",M2
19422720,"Respiratory burst function of ovine neutrophils.BACKGROUND: Respiratory burst function resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O2-) from neutrophils is one of the key mechanisms of the innate immune system, and maladaptive control of this mechanism is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of pathologies such as acute lung injury and sepsis. Ovine models of these pathologies are limited by the poor understanding of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function. RESULTS: Aspects of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function to be characterised were: i) the maximum rate of O2- generated (Vmax); ii) the time taken to reach Vmax; iii) the total amount of O2- generated during the reaction; and iv) the duration of the reaction. As well as for unstimulated neutrophils, these aspects were also characterised after incubation with a priming agonist (platelet activating factor [<e>PAF</e>], tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha] and lipopolysaccharides [LPS]) activating agonists (N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [PMA]) or a combination of a priming and an activating agonist. In the absence of priming or activating agonists, ovine neutrophils displayed a low level of respiratory burst function which was not enhanced by either PAF, TNF-alpha, LPS or fMLP, but was significantly enhanced by PMA. The PMA-induced respiratory burst function was further enhanced by pre-incubation with PAF, but not with TNF-alpha or LPS. By varying the length of pre-incubation with PAF it was demonstrated that this effect decreased as the duration of pre-incubation with PAF increased, and that PAF was enhancing PMA's effects rather than PMA enhancing PAF's effects. CONCLUSION: This study successfully adapted a commonly used method of measuring human neutrophil respiratory burst function to characterise different aspects of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function. This improved understanding of ovine neutrophils will facilitate the validitation of ovine biomedical models of human pathologies in which neutrophils have been implicated.",M2
19415549,"Common pathways for activation of proinflammatory gene expression by G protein-coupled receptors in primary lung epithelial and endothelial cells.Acute lung injury is associated with an inflammatory response resulting from the action of multiple mediators. Many proinflammatory mediators released during lung injury exert effects by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The authors' earlier studies showed that substance P (SP), a ligand for the tachykinin 1 receptor, induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation and interleukin (IL)-8 up-regulation through a G(q)-dependent pathway. Here the authors extend these findings by examining effects of multiple ligands for G(q)-coupled GPCRs in primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and rat lung microvessel endothelial cells (RLMVECs). SP, bradykinin, protease activated receptor 2 agonist, and platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) stimulated IL-8 production in SAECs, whereas only SP and PAF up-regulated CINC-1 (a rat IL-8 homolog) in RLMVECs. Using signaling inhibitors, the authors investigated PAF-induced IL-8 expression and SP-induced CINC-1 expression in primary cells. Signaling cascades were similar in SAECs and RLMVECs and involved phospholipase C/calcium/protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras/Raf/Erk pathways. In addition, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG 17 and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly reduced IL-8 and CINC-1 expression induced by GPCR ligands. The results demonstrate a common signaling pathway in primary lung epithelial and endothelial cells, suggesting a generalized mechanism for the induction of proinflammatory gene expression by G(q)-coupled GPCRs following lung injury.",M2
19389802,"HCl-activated neural and epithelial vanilloid receptors (TRPV1) in cat esophageal mucosa.To test whether transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member-1 (TRPV1) mediates acid-induced inflammation in the esophagus, a tubular segment of esophageal mucosa was tied at both ends, forming a sac. The sac was filled with 0.01 N HCl (or Krebs buffer for control) and kept in oxygenated Krebs buffer at 37 degrees C. The medium around the sac (supernatant) was collected after 3 h. Supernatant of the HCl-filled sac abolished contraction of esophageal circular muscle strips in response to electric field stimulation. Contraction was similarly abolished by supernatant of mucosal sac filled with the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (10(-6) M). These effects were reversed by the selective TRPV1 antagonist 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) and by the platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) receptor antagonist CV9388. Substance P and CGRP levels in mucosa and in supernatant increased in response to HCl, and these increases were abolished by IRTX and by tetrodotoxin (TTX) but not affected by CV9388, indicating that substance P and CGRP are neurally released and PAF independent. In contrast, the increase in PAF was blocked by IRTX but not by TTX. Presence of TRPV1 receptor was confirmed by RT-PCR and by Western blot analysis in whole mucosa and in esophageal epithelial cells enzymatically isolated and sorted by flow cytometry or immunoprecipitated with cytokeratin antibodies. In epithelial cells PAF increased in response to HCl, and the increase was abolished by IRTX. We conclude that HCl-induced activation of TRPV1 receptors in esophageal mucosa causes release of substance P and CGRP from neurons and release of PAF from epithelial cells.",M2
19342481,"Internalization of eNOS and NO delivery to subcellular targets determine agonist-induced hyperpermeability.The molecular mechanisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulation of microvascular permeability remain unresolved. Agonist-induced internalization may have a role in this process. We demonstrate here that internalization of eNOS is required to deliver NO to subcellular locations to increase endothelial monolayer permeability to macromolecules. Using dominant-negative mutants of dynamin-2 (dyn2K44A) and caveolin-1 (cav1Y14F), we show that anchoring eNOS-containing caveolae to plasma membrane inhibits hyperpermeability induced by platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), VEGF in ECV-CD8eNOSGFP (ECV-304 transfected cells) and postcapillary venular endothelial cells (CVEC). We also observed that anchoring caveolar eNOS to the plasma membrane uncouples eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 from NO production. This dissociation occurred in a mutant- and cell-dependent way. PAF induced Ser-1177-eNOS phosphorylation in ECV-CD8eNOSGFP and CVEC transfected with dyn2K44A, but it dephosphorylated eNOS at Ser-1177 in CVEC transfected with cav1Y14F. Interestingly, dyn2K44A eliminated NO production, whereas cav1Y14F caused reduction in NO production in CVEC. NO production by cav1Y14F-transfected CVEC occurred in caveolae bound to the plasma membrane, and was ineffective in causing an increase in permeability. Our study demonstrates that eNOS internalization is required for agonist-induced hyperpermeability, and suggests that a mechanism by which eNOS is activated by phosphorylation at the plasma membrane and its endocytosis is required to deliver NO to subcellular targets to cause hyperpermeability.",M2
19295175,"Amantadine inhibits platelet-activating factor induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human neutrophils.Receptor signaling is integral for adhesion, emigration, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species production in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Priming is an important part of PMN emigration, but it can also lead to PMN-mediated organ injury in the host. Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) primes PMNs through activation of a specific G protein-coupled receptor. We hypothesize that PAF priming of PMNs requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of the PAF receptor (PAFr), and, therefore, amantadine, known to inhibit CME, significantly antagonizes PAF signaling. PMNs were isolated by standard techniques to &gt;98% purity and tested for viability. Amantadine (1 mM) significantly inhibited the PAF-mediated changes in the cellular distribution of clathrin and the physical colocalization [fluorescence resonance energy transfer positive (FRET+)] of early endosome antigen-1 and Rab5a, known components of CME and similar to hypertonic saline, a known inhibitor of CME. Furthermore, amantadine had no effect on the PAF-induced cytosolic calcium flux; however, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was significantly decreased. Amantadine inhibited PAF-mediated changes in PMN physiology, including priming of the NADPH oxidase and shape change with lesser inhibition of increases in CD11b surface expression and elastase release. Furthermore, rimantadine, an amantadine analog, was a more potent inhibitor of PAF priming of the N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-activated oxidase. PAF priming of PMNs requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis that is inhibited when PMNs are pretreated with either amantadine or rimantadine. Thus, amantadine and rimantadine have the potential to ameliorate PMN-mediated tissue damage in humans.",M2
19290950,"Regulation of platelet activating factor-induced equine platelet activation by intracellular kinases.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate equine platelets directly or indirectly, via leukocyte-derived platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>). Thromboxane (Tx) production by LPS-stimulated equine platelets requires p38 MAPK and this kinase has been suggested as a therapeutic target in endotoxaemia. The present study has utilised selective inhibitors to investigate the role of p38 MAPK and two other kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC), in regulating PAF-induced Tx production, aggregation and 5-HT release in equine platelets, and the modification of these responses by LPS. LPS enhanced PAF-induced 5-HT release, an effect that was reduced by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (60 +/- 8% reduction; n = 6). SB203580 did not affect responses to PAF alone; whereas inhibition of PKC reduced PAF-induced 5-HT release, Tx production and aggregation (maximal inhibition by the PKCdelta inhibitor, rottlerin: 69 +/- 13%, 63 +/- 14% and 97 +/- 1%, respectively; n = 6). Wortmannin and LY249002, which inhibit PI3K, also caused significant inhibition of PAF-induced aggregation (maximal inhibition 78 +/- 3% and 88 +/- 2%, respectively; n = 6). These data suggest that inhibition of platelet p38 MAPK may be of benefit in equine endotoxaemia by counteracting some of the effects of LPS. However, detrimental effects of platelet activation mediated by PAF and not enhanced by LPS are unlikely to be markedly affected.",M2
19283893,"Mechanisms underlying the nociceptive responses induced by platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in the rat paw.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an inflammatory mediator widely known to exert relevant pathophysiological functions. However, the relevance of PAF in nociception has received much less attention. Herein, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying PAF-induced spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat paw. PAF injection (1- 30 nmol/paw) resulted in a dose-related overt nociception, whilst only the dose of 10 nmol/ paw produced a significant and time-related mechanical hypersensitivity. Local coinjection of PAF antagonist WEB2086 significantly inhibited both spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, the coinjection of the natural IL-1beta receptor antagonist (IRA) notably prevented both PAF-induced nociceptive responses, whilst these responses were not altered by anti-TNFalpha coinjection. Interestingly, pretreatment with the ultrapotent vaniloid agonist resiniferotoxin, coinjection of the TRPV1 receptor antagonist SB366791, or mast cell depletion with compound 48/80 markedly prevented PAF-induced spontaneous nociception. Conversely, PAF-elicited mechanical hypersensitivity was strikingly susceptible to distinct antineutrophil-related strategies, namely the antineutrophil antibody, the selectin blocker fucoidin, the chemokine CXCR2 receptor antagonist SB225002, and the C5a receptor antibody anti-CD88. Notably, the same antineutrophil migration strategies significantly prevented the increase of myeloperoxidase activity induced by PAF. The mechanical hypersensitivity caused by PAF was also prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or celecoxib, and by the selective beta(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol. Collectively, the present results provide consistent evidence indicating that distinct mechanisms are involved in the spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity caused by PAF. They also support the concept that selective PAF receptor antagonists might constitute interesting targets for the development of new analgesic drugs.",M2
19242794,"Platelet-activating factor involvement in thioacetamide-induced experimental liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a potent lipid inflammatory mediator acting on cells through its specific receptor. Plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is the main enzyme that inactivates PAF in blood, participating in its homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the involvement of PAF in the liver fibrotic process using an experimental animal model. Liver fibrosis was induced in adult male Wistar rats by administration of thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water (300 mg/l) for three months. The animals were sacrificed at time 0 (control group) and after 1, 2, and 3 months. PAF levels in liver and blood and PAF-AH activity in plasma were determined. Liver histopathological examination was also performed. TAA administration resulted in progressively increased liver fibrosis, leading finally to the formation of cirrhotic nodules in the liver. Throughout the experiment PAF levels in liver tissue remained stable.  Total  ( free  plus  bound ) PAF levels in blood decreased, reaching statistically significant differences in the first and third months compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05).  Free  PAF levels in blood were higher at one month (P &lt; 0.05) and decreased gradually thereafter. In all treated groups,  bound  PAF levels in blood decreased whereas plasma PAF-AH activity increased (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group. Our data indicated alterations of PAF levels in blood and PAF-AH activity during fibrosis induction, implicating participation of PAF in the liver fibrotic process.",M2
19235626,"Independent regulation of periarteriolar and perivenular nitric oxide mechanisms in the in vivo hamster cheek pouch microvasculature.OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that differential stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) production can be induced in pre- and postcapillary segments of the microcirculation in the hamster cheek pouch. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied acetylcholine (ACh) or platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) topically and measured perivascular NO concentration ([NO]) with NO-sensitive microelectrodes in arterioles and venules of the hamster cheek pouch. We also measured NO in cultured coronary endothelial cells (CVEC) after ACh or PAF. RESULTS: ACh increased periarteriolar [NO] significantly in a dose-dependent manner. ACh at 1 microM increased [NO] from 438.1+/-43.4 nM at baseline to 647.9+/-66.3 nM, while 10 microM of ACh increased [NO] from baseline to 1,035.0+/-59.2 nM (P&lt;0.05). Neither 1 nor 10 microM of ACh changed perivenular [NO] in the hamster cheek pouch. PAF, at 100 nM, increased perivenular [NO] from 326.6+/-50.8 to 622.8+/-41.5 nM. Importantly, 100 nM of PAF did not increase periarteriolar [NO]. PAF increased [NO] from 3.6+/-2.1 to 455.5+/-19.9 in CVEC, while ACh had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO production can be stimulated in a differential manner in pre- and postcapillary segments in the hamster cheek pouch. ACh selectively stimulates the production of NO only in arterioles, while PAF stimulates the production of NO only in venules.",M2
19234179,"Ultraviolet B radiation generated platelet-activating factor receptor agonist formation involves EGF-R-mediated reactive oxygen species.Recent studies have implicated the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in UVB-mediated systemic immunosuppression known to be a major cause for skin cancers. Previously, our group has demonstrated that UVB irradiation triggers the production of PAF and oxidized glycerophosphocholines that act as PAF-receptor (PAF-R) agonists. The present studies explored the mechanisms by which UVB generates PAF-R agonists. UVB irradiation of human epidermal KB cells resulted in both increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PAF-R agonistic activity. Pretreatment of KB cells with antioxidants vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine or the pharmacological inhibitor PD168393 specific for the epidermal growth factor receptor all inhibited UVB-induced ROS as well as PAF-R agonists, yet had no effect on fMLP-mediated PAF-R agonist production. In addition, in vivo production of PAF-R agonists from UVB-irradiated mouse skin was blocked by both systemic vitamin C administration and topical PD168393 application. Moreover, both vitamin C and PD168393 abolished UVB-mediated but not the PAF-R agonist 1-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamoyl glycerophosphocholine-mediated immunosuppression as measured by the inhibition of delayed type contact hypersensitivity to the chemical dinitrofluorobenzene. These studies suggest that UVB-induced systemic immunosuppression is due to epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated ROS which results in PAF-R agonist formation.",M2
19232405,"Physalin B inhibits Rhodnius prolixus hemocyte phagocytosis and microaggregation by the activation of endogenous <e>PAF</e>-acetyl hydrolase activities.The effects of physalin B (a natural secosteroidal chemical from Physalis angulata, Solanaceae) on phagocytosis and microaggregation by hemocytes of 5th-instar larvae of Rhodnius prolixus were investigated. In this insect, hemocyte phagocytosis and microaggregation are known to be induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) or arachidonic acid (AA) and regulated by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and PAF-acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) activities. Phagocytic activity and formation of hemocyte microaggregates by Rhodnius hemocytes were strongly blocked by oral treatment of this insect with physalin B (1mug/mL of blood meal). The inhibition induced by physalin B was reversed for both phagocytosis and microaggregation by exogenous arachidonic acid (10microg/insect) or PAF (1microg/insect) applied by hemocelic injection. Following treatment with physalin B there were no significant alterations in PLA(2) activities, but a significant enhancement of PAF-AH was observed. These results show that physalin B inhibits hemocytic activity by depressing insect PAF analogous (iPAF) levels in hemolymph and confirm the role of PAF-AH in the cellular immune reactions in R. prolixus.",M2
19194797,"Protection of PMS777, a new AChE inhibitor with <e>PAF</e> antagonism, against amyloid-beta-induced neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation.Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a central role in the neuroinflammation and cholinergic neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease, and thus has been considered as a main determinant of this disease. In the previous study, we reported that PMS777, a novel bis-interacting ligand for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonism, could significantly attenuate PAF-induced neurotoxicity. Continuing our efforts, we further investigated the protective effect of PMS777 on Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and neuroinflammation in vivo. PMS777 (1-100 microM) was found to inhibit Abeta-induced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Concurrently, PMS777 increased ratio of bcl-2 to bax mRNA, and inhibited both mRNA expression and activity of caspase-3 in SH-SY5Y cells after the exposure with Abeta. In vivo experimental study demonstrated that PMS777 could attenuate Abeta-induced microglial and astrocytic activation in the rat hippocampus after systemic administration. These results suggest that PMS777 potently protects against Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation, and warrants further investigations in connection with its potential value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",M2
19168951,"Expression and DNA microarray analysis of a platelet activating factor-related molecule in severe pneumonia in mice due to influenza virus and bacterial co-infection.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a critical mediator of severe inflammatory diseases such as pneumonia, and the PAF-receptor (PAFR) is known to be an anchor for Streptococcus pneumoniae attachment to lung epithelial cells. We conducted a DNA microarray analysis to detect critical factors that mediate fulminant pneumonia due to influenza virus and S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice. Among the factors detected, levels of PAF-acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), which functions as inactivated PAF, were significantly increased, and PAFR was expressed in co-infected mouse lungs, as compared to the respective levels in mice infected with either S. pneumoniae or virus alone. Significantly elevated PAF-AH enzymatic activity was observed in the co-infected mouse lung, suggesting that co-infection activated PAF-related factors. These findings suggest that PAF and related molecules play important roles in fulminant pneumonia due to influenza virus infection, especially when severe bacterial pneumonia is complicated by co-infection with influenza virus.",M2
19136156,"The effect of lidocaine on in vitro adhesion and migration of equine neutrophils.The effect of lidocaine on in vitro migration and adhesion of equine neutrophils was evaluated. Neutrophils were isolated from equine whole blood using a Percoll-gradient centrifugation protocol. Purified neutrophils were incubated with lidocaine at concentrations from 0.1 to 1000 microg/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees C, after calcein loading. Neutrophil integrin-mediated adhesion in response to stimulation with 100 nM LTB(4), 100 nM <e>PAF</e>, or 100 ng/ml IL-8, or integrin-mediated migration in response to stimulation with 100 nM LTB(4), 150 nM PAF, or 100 ng/ml IL-8 was assessed. Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05. Neutrophil adhesion was significantly increased in response to all three stimulants. IL-8-stimulated adhesion was significantly increased when neutrophils were incubated with 1mg/ml lidocaine, compared to lower lidocaine concentrations. LTB(4)-stimulated adhesion was significantly increased when neutrophils were incubated with 1mg/ml lidocaine compared to that at 5 microg/ml lidocaine. Migration was significantly increased in response to IL-8. IL-8 and LTB(4) stimulated migration was significantly increased when neutrophils were incubated with 1mg/ml lidocaine, compared to lower lidocaine concentrations. In conclusion, lidocaine did not inhibit neutrophil migration or adhesion in vitro at therapeutic concentrations, and increased migration and adhesion at higher concentrations.",M2
19127068,"Pimecrolimus reduces eosinophil activation associated with calcium mobilization.BACKGROUND: Pimecrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell and mast cell activation and effectively treats atopic dermatitis. However, its effects on eosinophils, a cell type implicated in allergic disease pathology, are unknown. Therefore, we examined the effects of pimecrolimus on eosinophil superoxide anion production, degranulation and survival. METHODS: Purified eosinophils from normal or atopic donors were incubated with serial dilutions of pimecrolimus (microM to nM) and then stimulated with platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), interleukin 5 (IL5), secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) or Alternaria alternata (Alt) fungus extract. Eosinophil activation was monitored by cytochrome c reduction resulting from superoxide anion production and by a 2-site immunoassay for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) in cellular supernatants, as a marker of degranulation. Eosinophil survival was measured by propidium iodide exclusion using flow cytometry after 4 days in culture. RESULTS: Normal and atopic eosinophil superoxide anion production induced by PAF, and associated with increased intracellular calcium, was inhibited up to 37% with 1 microM pimecrolimus. However, superoxide anion production induced by IL5 and sIgA was not consistently inhibited. EDN release, which ultimately depends on calcium, was inhibited about 30% with PAF, IL5 and sIgA stimulation for normal and atopic donor eosinophils. Furthermore, calcium-dependent Alt-induced EDN release was inhibited up to 49% with nanomolar pimecrolimus. Finally, increased eosinophil survival promoted by IL5 and sIgA was not influenced by pimecrolimus. CONCLUSION: Pimecrolimus moderately inhibits eosinophil superoxide anion production and EDN release associated with calcium mobilization, which may contribute to its efficacy in treating atopic dermatitis.",M2
19118503,"Effects of Ginkgo biloba on airway histology in a mouse model of chronic asthma.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is an inflammatory mediator involved in the pathophysiology of asthma, suggesting a therapy antagonizing its effects may play a role in the disease treatment. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of Ginkgo biloba, a PAF antagonist, on lung histology. Thirty-five BALB/c mice were divided into five groups; A, B, C, D, and the control. All mice except controls were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Mice in group A (placebo) received saline; group B received G. biloba, 100 mg/kg; group C received G. biloba, 150 mg/kg; and group D received dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg via orogastric gavage for 7 consecutive days. Chronic structural changes and airway remodeling were evaluated by using light and electron microscopy in all groups. Evaluation of lung histology indicated that the number of goblet cells, mast cells, thicknesses of epithelium, and basement membrane were significantly improved in groups B and C when compared with group A. There was no statistically significant difference in thicknesses of subepithelial smooth muscle between groups A, B, and C. When doses of G. biloba were compared with each other, only the number of goblet cells was significantly lower in group C than in group B. When G. biloba and dexamethasone groups were compared with each other, thicknesses of basement membrane and subepithelial smooth muscle were found to be lower in group D than in groups B and C. G. biloba alleviates all established chronic histological changes of lung except smooth muscle thickness in a mouse model of asthma.",M2
19096919,"Edematogenic activity of scorpion venoms from the Buthidae family and the role of platelet-activating factor and nitric oxide in paw edema induced by Tityus venoms.We compared the edematogenic activity of venoms of scorpions from the Buthidae family, Tityus bahiensis (Tbv), Tityus serrulatus (Tsv) and Rhopalurus rochai (Rrv). Three doses (20, 40 and 80 microg/kg sc) of each venom were administrated in hind paw of mice and edema was measured from 5 min to 24 h. Tbv and Tsv both induced edema of rapid onset (135% of increase at 15 min); Rrv induced only a mild edema (40% of increase). We then investigated the involvement of platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) and endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in Tbv and Tsv-induced paw edema. Pretreatment of mice with a PAF antagonist (WEB-2170) inhibited Tsv but not Tbv-induced edema. Pretreatment with a non selective inhibitor of NO-synthases (L: -NAME) inhibited or increased the edema depending on the dose and the time the edema was measured. In conclusion, the venoms from Tityus are stronger inducers of edema than the venom from the Rhopalurus scorpion. The venoms of Tityus species are similar in potency and time-course edema development. PAF is involved in the edema induced only by Tsv.",M2
19095647,"Tiam1 and Rac1 are required for platelet-activating factor-induced endothelial junctional disassembly and increase in vascular permeability.It is known that platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) induces severe endothelial barrier leakiness, but the signaling mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using a wide range of biochemical and morphological approaches applied in both mouse models and cultured endothelial cells, we addressed the mechanisms of PAF-induced disruption of interendothelial junctions (IEJs) and of increased endothelial permeability. The formation of interendothelial gaps filled with filopodia and lamellipodia is the cellular event responsible for the disruption of endothelial barrier. We observed that PAF ligation of its receptor induced the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1. Following PAF exposure, both Rac1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 were found associated with a membrane fraction from which they co-immunoprecipitated with PAF receptor. In the same time frame with Tiam1-Rac1 translocation, the junctional proteins ZO-1 and VE-cadherin were relocated from the IEJs, and formation of numerous interendothelial gaps was recorded. Notably, the response was independent of myosin light chain phosphorylation and thus distinct from other mediators, such as histamine and thrombin. The changes in actin status are driven by the PAF-induced localized actin polymerization as a consequence of Rac1 translocation and activation. Tiam1 was required for the activation of Rac1, actin polymerization, relocation of junctional associated proteins, and disruption of IEJs.

19075994,"Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>): a review of its role in asthma and clinical efficacy of PAF antagonists in the disease therapy.PAF is a potent proinflammatory mediator which plays a role in different inflammatory diseases, including bronchial asthma. PAF is able to induce key pathogenic features of asthma and to influence the activity of cells involved in immune-inflammatory process; it may therefore serve as a possible direct target for anti-asthmatic drugs. Specific PAF antagonists (PAF receptors antagonists and recombinant plasma PAF acetylhydrolase attenuating its bioactivity) contributed to our better understanding of its role in asthma but unfortunately have not provided any further therapeutic option in the disease, due to minor or lacking effects. However, single treatment with PAF antagonist in asthma therapy revealed at its very best only a little effect. The concept of combined therapy targeting PAF and other mediators involved in the disease seems to be of particular interest. This review is a brief summary of relevant scientific basis as well as clinical research on the role of PAF in asthma, the significance of anti-PAF therapy in the disease, as well as US. patents (1998-2002) related to PAF antagonists.",M2
19069165,"[Plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (<e>PAF</e>-AH) deficiency as a risk factor for stroke]Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid mediator with a wide range of potent biological activities. The molecular structure of PAF is identified as 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine and it is degraded by the enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), which removes the sn-2 acetyl moiety of the molecule. Plasma PAF-AH activity is elevated in various disorders, including stroke, and this is considered an adaptation to the enhanced inflammatory or thrombotic processes in such disorders. Deficiency of plasma PAF-AH occurs due to a missense mutation (G994--&gt;C) in exon 9 of the PAF-AH gene, which results in a Val--&gt;Phe substitution at position 279 of the mature enzyme protein. This mutation is found in about 4% of the general Japanese population. However, it is not specifically related to any particular disease. The prevalence of plasma PAF-AH deficiency and the frequency of mutant alleles are significantly higher in patients suffering from stroke as compared to healthy controls. The prevalence of the mutation was similar in the groups of patients with atherothrombotic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage. There was no difference in the prevalence of the mutation in the patients with essential hypertension as compared to that in healthy in controls. Therefore plasma PAF-AH deficiency may be considered as a genetic risk factor for stroke, and recognition of this mutation in individuals may be useful for early initiation of preventive measures against stroke.",M2
19059366,"Inhibition of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 prevents inflammatory mediator production in pulmonary microvascular endothelium.Inhalation of allergens can result in mast cell degranulation and release of granule contents, including tryptase, in the lung. Injury to human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) can also result in activation of the coagulation cascade and thrombin generation. We hypothesize that these proteases activate calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), in HMVEC-L, leading to the production of membrane phospholipids-derived inflammatory mediators. Both thrombin and tryptase stimulation of HMVEC-L increased iPLA2 activity that was inhibited by pretreatment with the iPLA2 selective inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL). Arachidonic acid and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) release were also increased in tryptase and thrombin stimulated cells and inhibited by BEL pretreatment. Pretreating the endothelial cells with AACOCF3 a cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor did not inhibit tryptase or thrombin induced arachidonic acid and PGI2 release. In addition thrombin and tryptase also increased HMVEC-L platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) production that significantly contributes to the recruitment and initial adherence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to the endothelium. Tryptase or thrombin stimulated increase in PMN adherence to the endothelium was inhibited by pretreatment of HMVEC-L with BEL or pretreatment of PMN with CV3988, a PAF receptor specific antagonist. Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that iPLA2 activity is responsible for membrane phospholipid hydrolysis in response to tryptase or thrombin stimulation in HMVEC-L. Therefore selective inhibition of iPLA2 may be a pharmacological target to inhibit the early inflammation in pulmonary vasculature that occurs as a consequence of mast cell degranulation or acute lung injury.",M2

DESIGN AND METHODS: PAF, and two of its key biosynthetic enzymes [lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT) and DTT-insensitive CDP-choline:1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT)] along with its catabolic enzymes [PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A(2) (Lp-PLA(2))] were measured in serum and leukocytes of twelve newly diagnosed male HF patients. Serum CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, sCD14 and CD40L were also determined. RESULTS: PAF ranged from 0.03 to 5.6 pmol/mL. Median lyso-PAF-AT, PAF-CPT, PAF-AH and Lp-PLA(2) activities were 4.1, 68.42, 644.44 pmol/min/mg protein and 51.42 pmol/min/microL correspondingly. Lyso-PAF-AT and PAF-CPT activities positively correlated with CRP, IL-6 and with each other, whereas PAF-CPT activity correlated with sCD14 and CD40L (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PAF's biosynthetic enzyme activities correlated with inflammatory and immunologic molecules, which are activated in HF. Our study indicates a potential role of PAF in HF patients.",M2
18937225,"Identification of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) from PC12 cells and mouse cortex using liquid chromatography/multi-stage mass spectrometry (LC/MS3).Lipids play essential roles in cellular structural support, energy storage and signal transduction. Recently, mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to produce three-dimensional maps that elucidate the lipid composition of complex cellular lysates. The identification of individual lipids within these maps is slow and requires the synthesis and spiking of each candidate lipid. We present a novel MS-based technique that rapidly elucidates the atomic connectivity of the fatty acid/alcohol substituent on the sn-1 position of several different families of glycerophosphocholine-containing lipids within the confines of a chromatographic separation. Sodiated lipid species were fragmented to produce radical cations which lost successive methylene groups upon further collisional activation to reveal the identity of the parent molecule. This approach was demonstrated to be effective on isobaric members of the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and platelet activating factor (PAF) families of glycerophospholipids. We demonstrate the application of this technique to unambiguously identify these species within complex cellular lysates and tissue extracts.",M2
18931035,"Opposing effects of platelet-activating factor and lyso-platelet-activating factor on neutrophil and platelet activation.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a potent, bioactive phospholipid that acts on multiple cells and tissues through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). PAF is not stored but is rapidly generated via enzymatic acetylation of the precursor 1-O-hexadecyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysoPAF). The bioactivity of PAF is effectively and tightly regulated by PAF acetylhydrolases, which convert PAF back to lysoPAF. Previous studies report that lysoPAF is an inactive precursor and metabolite of PAF. However, lysoPAF has not been carefully studied in its own context. Here we report that lysoPAF has an opposing effect of PAF in the activation of neutrophils and platelets. Whereas PAF potentiates neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation, lysoPAF dose-dependently inhibits this function. Inhibition by lysoPAF is not affected by the use of a PAF receptor antagonist or genetic deletion of the PAF receptor gene. The mechanism of lysoPAF-mediated inhibition of neutrophils involves an elevation in the intracellular cAMP level, and pharmacological blockade of adenylyl cyclase completely reverses the inhibitory effect of lysoPAF. In addition, lysoPAF increases intracellular cAMP levels in platelets and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, which can be reversed by inhibition of protein kinase A. These findings identify lysoPAF as a bioactive lipid with opposing functions of PAF and suggest a novel and intrinsic regulatory mechanism for balance of the potent activity of PAF.",M2

These Ca2+-independent phospholipases A2 display remarkable specificity for the length of the sn-2 residue, but this selectivity is lost as the residue gains oxygen functions. Two of the PAF-AHs therefore are specific oxidized phospholipid phospholipases that reduce inflammation, but also remove oxidatively truncated phospholipids that induce apoptosis.

In vitro assay of 5a-s indicated that their potencies for inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (AA), platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), and thrombin (TH)-induced platelet aggregations were higher than that of 1. Additionally, in vivo assay of 5a-s indicated that their potencies for inhibiting thrombogenesis in rats were also higher than that of 1. Among the candidates, 5h with Ser attachment showed the most impressive features for further development. According to molecular field analysis based Cerius(2) QSAR module, two equations (r, 0.961 and 0.988) correlating the structures with both in vitro and in vivo activities of 5a-s were established. ADMET calculations predict higher intestinal absorption for compounds 5a-s. Further investigation with 5h as a lead compound is underway.",M2
18808659,"Differential regulation of wild-type and mutant alpha-synuclein binding to synaptic membranes by cytosolic factors.BACKGROUND: Alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn), a 140 amino acid protein associated with presynaptic membranes in brain, is a major constituent of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Three missense mutations (A30P, A53T and E46K) in the alpha-syn gene are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial PD. However, the regulation of alpha-syn's cellular localization in neurons and the effects of the PD-linked mutations are poorly understood. RESULTS: In the present study, we analysed the ability of cytosolic factors to regulate alpha-syn binding to synaptic membranes. We show that co-incubation with brain cytosol significantly increases the membrane binding of normal and PD-linked mutant alpha-syn. To characterize cytosolic factor(s) that modulate alpha-syn binding properties, we investigated the ability of proteins, lipids, ATP and calcium to modulate alpha-syn membrane interactions. We report that lipids and ATP are two of the principal cytosolic components that modulate Wt and A53T alpha-syn binding to the synaptic membrane. We further show that 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16:0 <e>PAF</e>) is one of the principal lipids found in complex with cytosolic proteins and is required to enhance alpha-syn interaction with synaptic membrane. In addition, the impaired membrane binding observed for A30P alpha-syn was significantly mitigated by the presence of protease-sensitive factors in brain cytosol. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that endogenous brain cytosolic factors regulate Wt and mutant alpha-syn membrane binding, and could represent potential targets to influence alpha-syn solubility in brain.",M2
18802104,"Platelet-activating factor production in the spinal cord of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mice via the group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2-lyso-PAFAT axis.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) plays a critical role in inflammatory disorders including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Although PAF accumulation in the spinal cord (SC) of EAE mice and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients has been reported, little is known about the metabolic processing of PAF in these diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that the activities of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (LysoPAFAT) are elevated in the SC of EAE mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background compared with those of naive mice and correlate with disease severity. Correspondingly, levels of groups IVA, IVB, and IVF cytosolic PLA(2)s, group V secretory PLA(2), and LysoPAFAT transcripts are up-regulated in the SC of EAE mice. PAF acetylhydrolase activity is unchanged during the disease course. In addition, we show that LysoPAFAT mRNA and protein are predominantly expressed in microglia. Considering the substrate specificity and involvement of PAF production, group IVA cytosolic PLA(2) is likely to be responsible for the increased PLA(2) activity. These data suggest that PAF accumulation in the SC of EAE mice is profoundly dependent on the group IVA cytosolic PLA(2)/LysoPAFAT axis present in the infiltrating macrophages and activated microglia.",M2
18793637,"LAU-0901, a novel platelet-activating factor antagonist, is highly neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is a bioactive phospholipid that accumulates during ischemia-reperfusion and is involved in the activation of platelets, neutrophils, and pro-inflammatory signaling. PAF has been suggested to enhance brain ischemia-reperfusion damage. LAU-0901, a novel PAF receptor antagonist, was examined in models of focal cerebral ischemia in rats and mice. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and received 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by intraluminal suture. LAU-0901 (30, 60, 90 mg/kg; n=9-11) or vehicle (n=11) was administered i.p. at 2 h after onset of MCAo. The neurological status was evaluated at 60 min, and on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after MCAo. In the dose-response study in mice, C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized and received 1 h MCAo by intraluminal suture. LAU-0901 (15, 30, 60 mg/kg; n=7-9) or vehicle (n=8) was given i.p. at 1 h after onset of MCAo. Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after MCAo in mice. LAU-0901 treated rats showed improved neurological score throughout the 7-day survival period. LAU-0901 treatment (30, 60 and 90 mg/kg) reduced total corrected infarct volume compared to vehicle rats by 76, 88 and 90%, respectively. Mice treated with LAU-0901 (30 and 60 mg/kg) reduced total infarction by 29% and 66%, respectively. LCBF was improved by treatment with LAU-0901 (30 mg/kg) by 77% of baseline at 6 h. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that LAU-0901 improves behavioral scores, LCBF and reduces infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia in rats and mice. Thus, this PAF receptor antagonist exhibits potent and sustained neuroprotection that may be of value for the design of stroke therapies.",M2
18784071,"Crystal structure of human plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase: structural implication to lipoprotein binding and catalysis.Human plasma platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) acetylhydrolase functions by reducing PAF levels as a general anti-inflammatory scavenger and is linked to anaphylactic shock, asthma, and allergic reactions. The enzyme has also been implicated in hydrolytic activities of other pro-inflammatory agents, such as sn-2 oxidatively fragmented phospholipids. This plasma enzyme is tightly bound to low and high density lipoprotein particles and is also referred to as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been solved from x-ray diffraction data collected to a resolution of 1.5 angstroms. It has a classic lipase alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, and it contains a catalytic triad of Ser273, His351, and Asp296. Two clusters of hydrophobic residues define the probable interface-binding region, and a prediction is given of how the enzyme is bound to lipoproteins. Additionally, an acidic patch of 10 carboxylate residues and a neighboring basic patch of three residues are suggested to play a role in high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein partitioning. A crystal structure is also presented of PAF acetylhydrolase reacted with the organophosphate compound paraoxon via its active site Ser273. The resulting diethyl phosphoryl complex was used to model the tetrahedral intermediate of the substrate PAF to the active site. The model of interface binding begins to explain the known specificity of lipoprotein-bound substrates and how the active site can be both close to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface and at the same time be accessible to the aqueous phase.",M2
18720462,"Leucocyte and platelet adhesion in different layers of the small bowel during experimental total warm ischaemia and reperfusion.BACKGROUND: Ischaemia and reperfusion (IR) of the small bowel is involved in many clinical conditions. A key component in IR-induced tissue damage is microvascular dysfunction. The aim was to investigate the role of leucocytes and platelets in capillary flow impediment and tissue damage. METHODS: Anaesthetized rats were subjected to 30 min warm ischaemia of the small bowel, followed by 1 h reperfusion. To elucidate the influence of leucocytes on platelet adhesion, leucocyte-vessel wall interactions induced by IR were prevented by anti-platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) or anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Intravital videomicroscopy was performed and tissue injury was evaluated histologically. RESULTS: In submucosal venules, IR induced an increase in the median number of interacting leucocytes from 3 to 10 and 20 leucocytes per 100-microm venule segment after 10 and 60 min reperfusion respectively. Anti-PAF or anti-ICAM-1 completely attenuated this increase, resulting in an eightfold improvement in submucosal capillary flow and reduced tissue injury. Shedding of villi no longer occurred. Platelet-vessel wall interactions occurred particularly in submucosal venules, but were not affected by anti-PAF or anti-ICAM-1. CONCLUSION: Small bowel IR initiated an inflammatory and thrombotic response in the submucosal layer only. Attenuation of leucocyte adhesion improved submucosal capillary perfusion, preventing shedding of mucosal villi.",M2
18708444,"Internalization of eNOS via caveolae regulates <e>PAF</e>-induced inflammatory hyperpermeability to macromolecules.Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) is thought to regulate microvascular permeability via NO production. We tested the hypotheses that the expression of eNOS and eNOS endocytosis by caveolae are fundamental for appropriate signaling mechanisms in inflammatory endothelial permeability to macromolecules. We used bovine coronary postcapillary venular endothelial cells (CVECs) because these cells are derived from the microvascular segment responsible for the transport of macromolecules in inflammation. We stimulated CVECs with platelet-activating factor (PAF) at 100 nM and measured eNOS phosphorylation, NO production, and CVEC monolayer permeability to FITC-dextran 70 KDa (Dx-70). PAF translocated eNOS from plasma membrane to cytosol, induced changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, and increased NO production from 4.3+/-3.8 to 467+/-22.6 nM. PAF elevated CVEC monolayer permeability to FITC-Dx-70 from 3.4+/-0.3 x 10(-6) to 8.5+/-0.4 x 10(-6) cm/s. The depletion of endogenous eNOS with small interfering RNA abolished PAF-induced hyperpermeability, demonstrating that the expression of eNOS is required for inflammatory hyperpermeability responses. The inhibition of the caveolar internalization by blocking caveolar scission using transfection of dynamin dominant-negative mutant, dyn2K44A, inhibited PAF-induced hyperpermeability to FITC-Dx-70. We interpret these data as evidence that 1) eNOS is required for hyperpermeability to macromolecules and 2) the internalization of eNOS via caveolae is an important mechanism in the regulation of endothelial permeability. We advance the novel concept that eNOS internalization to cytosol is a signaling mechanism for the onset of microvascular hyperpermeability in inflammation.",M2

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of PAF antagonist WEB 2086 in acute experimental pancreatitis of graded severity in rats. METHODS: According to a block design, 64 animals were randomly allocated to 8 groups. Severe necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by intraductal infusion of taurocholic acid (4%, 0.4 mL), and the combination of glycodeoxycholic acid (10 mmol/L, 1.0 mL/kg, intraductal infusion) and cerulein (5 microg/kg per hour, intravenous) was applied to induce intermediate pancreatitis, or cerulein alone (5 microg/kg per hour, intravenous) to establish edematous pancreatitis. WEB 2086 was given 15 minutes after beginning the induction of pancreatitis. Pancreatic microcirculation was analyzed in vivo with an epiluminescent microscope. Histopathology was evaluated by a validated score. Trypsinogen-activating peptide and serum amylase were analyzed sequentially. RESULTS: WEB 2086 had no significant influence on the breakdown of microcirculation, leukocyte adherence, histopathological damage, and amylase levels in severe necrotizing pancreatitis, intermediate pancreatitis, and edematous pancreatitis. Only in intermediate pancreatitis was there a significant reduction of trypsinogen-activating peptide levels.

18677938,"[Production of chemoattractant-induced reactive oxygen species in human neutrophils--role of protein kinase C isoforms]The aim of our study was to characterize the priming effect of extracellular nucleotides on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>). Also, we investigated the roles played by different protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in nucleotide-induced priming. ROS production was determined by an isoluminol-based assay. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Nucleotide-induced priming was concentration- and time-dependent. The concentration of UTP able to cause maximal priming was 10 microM. When UTP (10 microM) was administered prior the agonist, the increase of the amplitude of the response reached the maximum at 1 minute of preincubation with the nucleotide. RESULTS: Calcium depletion of neutrophil caused significant inhibition of ROS production induced by all agonists tested, but did not affect the priming effect of the nucleotides. We tested the effect of several PKC inhibitors on the nucleotide-induced priming. GF 109203X (5 microM), an inhibitor of all neutrophil's PKC isoforms, or RO 31-8220 (5uM), an inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isoforms, abolished the responses induced by fMLP (10 nM) IL-8 (10 nM), LTB4 (100 nM) or PAF (100 nM). Go 6976 (100 nM), a selective inhibitor of classical PKC isoforms, had no effect on nucleotide-induced priming, suggesting that activation of these PKC isoforms does not play a role in the priming effect. Rottlerin (5 microM), a PKC delta inhibitor, almost abolished the effect of fMLP in the absence or in the presence of UTP, indicating that PKC delta is essential for the fMLP-induced effect; rottlerin also caused inhibition of ROS production induced by IL-8, LTB4 or PAF, however the priming effect of UTP was not affected for these chemoattractants. Our data suggest that classical PKC isoforms do not play a role in chemoattractant-induced ROS production. CONCLUSION: Although fMLP induced effect appears to be highly dependent on PKC delta activation, other chemoattractants are able to cause ROS production through PKC delta-independent mechanisms.",M2

Although marked IFN-gamma production was observed by CD11b(+), CD11c(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) splenocytes, CD11b(+) and CD11c(+) cells were shown to be the key effecter cells which generated pro-inflammatory lipid such as PAF and caused T.g.HSP70-induced anaphylactic reaction. In the present study, we found that the T.g.HSP70-induced anaphylactic reaction was not observed in TLR 4-deficient ((-/-)) mice, whereas it was observed in WT and TLR2(-/-) mice. The mRNA expression of PAF-AH, the main enzyme for PAF degradation, increased in T. gondii-infected WT and TLR2(-/-) but not in TLR4(-/-) mice after T.g.HSP70 injection. Furthermore, phosphorylation of cPLA(2), which is the key enzyme for pro-inflammatory lipid generation, was detected in CD11b(+) splenocytes of WT and TLR2(-/-) mice but not in TLR4(-/-) mice. Subsequently, cPLA(2) activation was suppressed by inhibiting the TLR4-directed p38 and p44/42 MAPK pathways. However, T.g.HSP70-induced anaphylactic reaction was observed in TRIF(-/-) mice, but not in MyD88(-/-) mice. These findings indicate the cPLA(2) activated-PAF production via TLR4/MyD88-dependent, but not TRIF-dependent, signaling pathway in T.g.HSP70-induced anaphylactic reaction in T. gondii-infected mice.",M2
18653653,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha reduces inflammation and vascular leakage in a murine model of acute lung injury.Acute lung injury (ALI) still represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Beneficial effects have been described after activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha by fibrates such as WY 14,643 (WY) in inflammatory models. In the present study, the impact of WY was investigated in a model of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS)-induced ALI in mice. Intratracheal LPS challenge dose-dependently resulted in leukocyte invasion, protein leakage and release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha as well as macrophage inflammatory protein-2, prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) into the alveolar space after 8 and 24 h. Lung ventilator compliance was reduced at both time-points. In isolated perfused mouse lungs, platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) induced an acute increase in pulmonary artery pressure (P(pa)) and in capillary filtration coefficient (K(fc)). WY significantly improved all features of ALI in vivo and blunted the increase in K(fc) in isolated perfused mice lungs. In mice with genetic deletion of PPAR-alpha, all characteristics of ALI, P(pa), and K(fc) were not significantly different from wild-type mice but WY failed to improve ALI and PAF-induced increase in K(fc). Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha by WY 14,643 reduced acute lung injury and vascular leakage.

18650283,"Platelet activating factor production and proinflammatory gene expression in endotoxin-challenged bovine mammary endothelial cells.The bovine mammary gland responds to gram-negative pathogens by stimulating the production of cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators that orchestrate the migration of leukocytes into tissues. Platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) are among the several inflammatory factors involved in the early activation and migration of leukocytes into the mammary gland during the initial stages of coliform mastitis. Several different cell types within the mammary gland are capable of expressing these potent pro-inflammatory mediators. The objective of this study was to characterize the expression profile of vascular-derived inflammatory molecules that may play a role in the pathogenesis of bovine coliform mastitis. Isolated bovine mammary gland endothelial cells were stimulated in culture for up to 12 h with endotoxin obtained from Escherichia coli, and the temporal expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules relative to endogenous PAF biosynthesis was evaluated. Results from the in vitro time course experiment showed that vascular-derived PAF biosynthesis began as early as 30 min and peaked at 1 h following endotoxin challenge. The biosynthesis of PAF preceded the endotoxin-induced IL-1 beta, IL-8, and ICAM1 mRNA expression that increased after 1 h and reached peak expression between 4 and 12 h following stimulation. Inhibiting the effects of endogenous PAF with a receptor antagonist suggests that vascular-derived PAF is an early proinflammatory mediator that plays at least a partial role in the subsequent expression of IL-1 beta, IL-8, and ICAM1 during endotoxin challenge. Furthermore, endotoxin-induced PAF biosynthesis by bovine mammary gland endothelial cells is regulated to some extent by phospholipase D activity and phosphatidic acid production. The results from this study support the contention that mammary gland endothelial cells can contribute to the production of important proinflammatory mediators that are typically associated with coliform mastitis.",M2

PAF antagonists have been studied in these conditions with promising results. In order to examine the possible interactions between PAF and antiretroviral therapy, we studied the effect of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors against PAF biological activities and its basic biosynthetic enzymes dithiothreitol-insensitive PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (Lyso-PAF-AT), as well as its main degradative enzyme PAF-acetylhydrolase, of human mesangial cell line (HMC). We also studied the effect of several backbones and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens against PAF activity. Among the drugs tested, several inhibited PAF-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-depended manner, with tenofovir, efavirenz, and ritonavir exhibiting the higher inhibitory effect. In addition, when these drugs were combined in backbones and HAART regimens based on American antiretroviral therapy proposals, they also synergistically exhibited an inhibitory effect against PAF-induced platelet aggregation. Several of these drugs have also inhibited in vitro microsomal PAF-CPT activity, and concentrations of lopinavir-r or tenofovir-DF (similar to their IC(50) against PAF-induced platelet aggregation) exhibited the same effect against PAF-CPT and Lyso-PAF-AT when added in the cell medium of cultured HMC. In addition, in naïve patients treated with one of the most potent anti-PAF HAART regimens (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir-DF) for a period of 1 month, a significant reduction of the specific activity of PAF-CPT of washed human leukocytes of these patients was also observed, compared with its levels before the HAART treatment. These promising results need to be further studied and confirmed by additional in vivo tests in order to optimize HAART efficacy.",M2
18587071,"Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities in human aorta and mammary artery.Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), the potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, is involved in atherosclerosis. Platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the enzyme that inactivates PAF bioactivity, possesses both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities. In the present study, we measured acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities in human atherogenic aorta and nonatherogenic mammary arteries. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed PAF-AH expression in the intima and the media of the aorta and in the media of mammary arteries. Acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities were (mean +/- SE, n = 38): acetylhydrolase of aorta, 2.8 +/- 0.5 pmol/min/mg of tissue; transacetylase of aorta, 3.3 +/- 0.7 pmol/min/mg of tissue; acetylhydrolase of mammary artery, 1.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/min/mg of tissue (P &lt; 0.004 as compared with acetylhydrolase of aorta); transacetylase of mammary artery, 0.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/min/mg of tissue (P &lt; 0.03 as compared with acetylhydrolase of mammary artery). Lyso-PAF accumulation and an increase in PAF bioactivity were observed in the aorta of some patients. Reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 1-O-hexadecyl-2 acetyl-sn glycero-3-phosphocholine accounted for 60% of the PAF bioactivity and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-butanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine for 40% of the PAF bioactivity. The nonatherogenic properties of mammary arteries may in part be due to low PAF formation regulated by PAF-AH activity. In atherogenic aortas, an imbalance between PAF-AH and transacetylase activity, as well as lyso-PAF accumulation, may lead to unregulated PAF formation and to progression of atherosclerosis.",M2
18583921,"<e>PAF</e>, rather than histamine, participates in mouse anaphylactic hypotension.We determined the roles of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and histamine in anaphylactic hypotension in ovalbumin-sensitized anesthetized BALB/c mice. The effects of PAF and histamine on hemodynamic variables were studied by measuring the systemic arterial (Psa), portal venous (Ppv) and central venous (Pcv) pressures. Intravenous PAF evoked a biphasic Psa response, an initial rapid and transient drop followed by marked hypotension, accompanied by a decrease in Pcv. Histamine caused only mild systemic hypotension. Both agents similarly increased Ppv by approximately 4 cm H(2)O at high doses. After an injection of antigen, Psa initially increased slightly and then decreased from the baseline of 94 +/- 1 mm Hg to 46 +/- 1 mm Hg at 10 min after antigen administration, with Pcv decreasing by 2.5 cm H(2)O. Ppv increased by 3.5 cm H(2)O at 5 min after antigen injection. Pretreatment with either CV-6209 (PAF receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg) or diphenhydramine (histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, 20 mg/kg) significantly attenuated an antigen-induced decrease in Psa. The inhibitory action of CV-6209 was greater than that of diphenhydramine, and the combination of these 2 antagonists almost completely inhibited the anaphylactic hypotension. In contrast, the antigen-induced increase in Ppv was attenuated by CV-6209 alone but augmented by diphenhydramine. It is concluded that anaphylactic hypotension is mainly mediated by PAF and, to a lesser extent, by histamine in anesthetized BALB/c mice.",M2
18580961,"Involvement of platelet-activating factor in ultraviolet B-induced hyperalgesia.Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causes cutaneous inflammation. One important clinical consequence of UVB-induced inflammation is increased pain or hyperalgesia, which is likely mediated by enhanced sensitivity of cutaneous sensory neurons. Previous studies have demonstrated that UVB radiation generates the lipid mediator, platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), as well as oxidized phospholipids that act as PAF-mimetics. These substances exert effects through the PAF receptor (PAF-R). This study was designed to assess whether PAF-R is involved in UVB-induced hyperalgesia. Intradermal injection of carbamoyl PAF (CPAF; 1-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamoyl glycerophosphocholine) resulted in an enhanced response to mechanical stimuli in wild-type mice but not in PAF-R knockout (KO) mice. There was no significant change in paw withdrawal to noxious thermal stimuli in either genotype after intradermal injection of CPAF. Exposure of the hind paw to 1,500 J m(-2) UVB radiation caused an increased sensitivity to both mechanical and thermal stimulation in wild-type mice but not in PAF-R KO mice. The thermal hyperalgesia caused by UVB irradiation was inhibited in mice that lacked PAF-R in bone marrow-derived cells. These data demonstrate that the PAF-R is important for UVB-induced hyperalgesia. Further investigation of the role of PAF-R signaling in UVB-induced hyperalgesia could provide better understanding of the pathological processes initiated by UVB-induced skin damage.",M2
18574670,"The influence of platelet activating factor on the effects of platelet agonists and antiplatelet agents in vitro.We assessed the effect of the intercellular mediator of inflammation, platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), on platelet function. The interaction between PAF and the platelet agonists ADP, thrombin and convulxin was analyzed in vitro in whole blood with the use of flow cytometry and was further characterized with the use of receptor antagonists to PAF (ABT-491), P2Y1 (MRS-2179), and P2Y12 (cangrelor) as well as a monoclonal anti-PSGL-1 antibody (anti-CD162). Low concentrations of PAF (0.1 nM) synergistically augmented platelet activation induced by other agonists (P &lt; 0.01). Augmentation by PAF was receptor mediated and did not require platelet-leukocyte interaction. With &gt;99% inhibition of P2Y receptor-mediated platelet activation, greater than additive activation was still observed with the combination of ADP plus PAF. Accordingly, PAF synergistically augments platelet activation in response to ADP and thrombin, and the extent of inhibition exerted by P2Y receptor antagonists is decreased in the presence of PAF.",M2
18568325,"Effect of volatile oil of amomum on expressions of platelet activating factor and mastocarcinoma-related peptide in the gastric membrane of chronic gastritis patients with helicobacter-pylori infection.OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of volatile oil of amomum (VOA) on the expressions of mastocarcinoma-related peptide (PS2) and platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) in helicobacter pyloriassociated gastritis (HPG) and to analyze its potential mechanism. METHODS: Eighty patients with HPG were randomly assigned to two groups, 42 patients in the treated group treated with 0.5 mL VOA, thrice per day; and the 38 patients in the control group receiving Western tertiary medicinal treatment. Gastroscopic picture and helicobacter pylori (HP) infection (by quick urease and Warthin-Starry stain) of the gastro-membrane, expressions of PS2 and PAF (by immunohistochemical assay and Western blotting) as well as the contents of aminohexose and phospholipid (by Neuhaus method) in the gastric membrane of all patients were detected before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment. The clinical efficacy in the two groups was compared. RESULTS: The total effective rate in the treated group was 88.1%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (78.9%, P&lt;0.05). After treatment, in the treated group, gastric membranous contents of aminohexose and phospholipid was increased, expression of PS2 elevated but that of PAF lowered, all showing significant difference as compared with those in the control group (P&lt;0.01). In the control group, the expressions of PS2 and PAF changed insignificantly. The radical eliminating rate of HP in the treated group and the control group was insignificantly different between them (76.1% vs. 65.8%, P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The mechanism of VOA for anti-gastritis might be related with its action in increasing the expression of PS2 and decreasing the expression of PAF, and thus regulating the hydrophobicity of the gastric membrane.",M2
18550892,"Heterogeneity in the sn-1 carbon chain of platelet-activating factor glycerophospholipids determines pro- or anti-apoptotic signaling in primary neurons.The platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) family of glycerophospholipids accumulates in damaged brain tissue following injury. Little is known about the role of individual isoforms in regulating neuronal survival. Here, we compared the neurotoxic and neuroprotective activities of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16-PAF) and 1-O-octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C18-PAF) in cerebellar granule neurons. We find that both C16-PAF and C18-PAF cause PAF receptor-independent death but signal through different pathways. C16-PAF activates caspase-7, whereas C18-PAF triggers caspase-independent death in PAF receptor-deficient neurons. We further show that PAF receptor signaling is either pro- or anti-apoptotic, depending upon the identity of the sn-1 fatty acid of the PAF ligand. Activation of the PAF G-protein-coupled receptor (PAFR) by C16-PAF stimulation is anti-apoptotic and inhibits caspase-dependent death. Activation of PAFR by C18-PAF is pro-apoptotic. These results demonstrate the importance of the long-chain sn-1 fatty acid in regulating PAF-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, caspase-independent neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection in the presence or absence of the PAF receptor.",M2
18524134,"Molecular weight of hydroxyethyl starch molecules influences coagulation profile measured by thrombelastography.BACKGROUND: The consensus about the ideal intravenous fluid in trauma patients remains open. However, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) seems to have advantages in terms of immuno-modulatory and haemodynamic effects. Nevertheless clotting abnormalities are frequently reported in association with the use of HES. We investigated the influence of light, medium and heavy molecular weight (MW) hydroxyethyl starch (HES) on coagulation in 29 healthy subjects. METHODS: Ringer's lactate (RL) served as a control solution. Thrombelastography using Haemoscope's Thrombelastograph (TEG) hemostasis system was used to assess the effect of HES polymers and RL. TEG analysis was performed using recalcified native whole blood both with and without the addition of platelet activating factor IV (<e>PAF</e> IV) before and immediately after infusion of one of the solutions. RESULTS: Infusion of RL or one of the three HES solutions exerts an anticoagulant effect as demonstrated by a increase in clot formation time (R) and a decrease in maximum amplitude (MA), and the angle. The addition of PAF IV reversed these changes. CONCLUSIONS: This data indicate clear evidence of platelet activity per se or platelet interaction with the plasmatic coagulation system.",M2
18523285,"Platelet-activating factor-mediated endosome formation causes membrane translocation of p67phox and p40phox that requires recruitment and activation of p38 MAPK, Rab5a, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in human neutrophils.Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs) are vital to innate immunity and receive proinflammatory signals that activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Because GPCRs transduce signals through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), we hypothesized that platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), an effective chemoattractant that primes the PMN oxidase, would signal through CME, specifically via dynamin-2 activation and endosomal formation resulting in membrane translocation of cytosolic phagocyte oxidase (phox) proteins. PMNs were incubated with buffer or 2 muM PAF for 1-3 min, and in some cases activated with PMA, and O(2)(-) was measured, whole-cell lysates and subcellular fractions were prepared, or the PMNs were fixed onto slides for digital or electron microscopy. PAF caused activation of dynamin-2, resulting in endosomal formation that required PI3K and contained early endosomal Ag-1 (EEA-1) and Rab5a. The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1/MAPK kinase-3/p38 MAPK signalosome assembled on Rab5a and phosphorylated EEA-1 and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, with the latter causing Rab5a activation. Electron microscopy demonstrated that PAF caused two distinct sites for activation of p38 MAPK. EEA-1 provided a scaffold for recruitment of the p40(phox)-p67(phox) complex and PI3K-dependent Akt1 phosphorylation of these two phox proteins. PAF induced membrane translocation of p40(phox)-p67(phox) localizing to gp91(phox), which was PI3K-, but not p47(phox)-, dependent. In conclusion, PAF transduces signals through CME, and such GPCR signaling may allow for pharmacological manipulation of these cells to decrease PMN-mediated acute organ injury.",M2
18522961,"Natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine as potential protective factors in SLE.OBJECTIVE: We have recently reported that natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine (anti-PC) have atheroprotective properties. Here we compare anti-PC with other autoantibodies in SLE patients with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Twenty-six women (52 +/- 8.2 yrs) with SLE and a history of CVD (SLE cases) were compared with 26 age-matched women with SLE without CVD (SLE controls) and 26 age-matched population-based control women (controls). PC was conjugated with BSA (PC-BSA) or keyhole-limpet haemocyanin (PC-KLH). Anti-PC and antibodies against phosphatidylserine (anti-PS) and BSA (anti-BSA) were studied by ELISA. Anti-PC-IgG were extracted from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Activation of endothelial cells by platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) was studied with FACScan. RESULTS: IgG anti-PC-BSA and anti-PC-KLH were decreased among SLE-cases and SLE-controls as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.005 and P &lt; 0.05), respectively. SLE cases were more prevalent in the lowest 25th percentile of anti-PC-IgM (and IgG) as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05) but anti-PC-IgM levels did not differ significantly between groups. Among SLE controls, anti-PC-BSA were associated negatively with organ damage (SLICC) and disease activity (SLEDAI) (P &lt; 0.05). Among SLE cases, anti-PC-BSA and anti-PC-KLH were associated negatively with SLICC (P = 0.021; P = 0.010) and anti-PC-BSA was negatively associated with SLEDAI (P &lt; 0.039). Anti-PS-IgG and anti-BSA-IgG were raised among SLE cases as compared with other groups (P &lt; 0.05) and did not cross-react with anti-PC. Anti-PC-IgG could be extracted from IVIG and inhibited PAF-induced expression of adhesion molecules. CONCLUSION: Low levels of anti-PC could be of importance in SLE. Anti-BSA and anti-PS and low levels of anti-PC could contribute to development of CVD in SLE.",M2
18515648,"Three-dimensional localization and quantification of <e>PAF</e>-induced gap formation in intact venular microvessels.Combining single-vessel perfusion technique with confocal microscopy, this study presents a new approach that allows three-dimensional visualization and quantification of endothelial gaps under experimental conditions identical to those used to measure permeability coefficients, endothelial calcium concentration, and nitric oxide production in individually perfused intact microvessels. This approach provides an efficient means for defining the transport pathways and cellular mechanisms of increased microvascular permeability during inflammation. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) was used to increase the permeability of individually perfused rat mesenteric venules. Fluorescent microspheres (FMs, 100 nm) were used as leakage markers, and confocal images were acquired at successive focal planes through the perfused microvessel. Perfusion of FMs under control conditions produced a thin, uniform layer of FMs in the vessel lumen, but in PAF-stimulated microvessels significant amounts of FMs accumulated at endothelial junctions. Reconstructed confocal images three-dimensionally delineated the temporal and spatial development of endothelial gaps in PAF-stimulated microvessels. The FM accumulation, quantified as the total fluorescence intensity per square micrometer of vessel wall, was 8.4 +/- 1.8 times the control value within 10 min of PAF perfusion and declined to 5.0 +/- 0.6 and 1.4 +/- 0.2 times the control value when FMs were applied 30 and 60 min after PAF perfusion. The changes in the magnitude of FM accumulation closely correlated with the time course of PAF-induced increases in hydraulic conductivity (L(p)), indicating that the opening and closing of endothelial gaps contributed to the transient increase in L(p) in PAF-stimulated microvessels. Electron microscopic evaluations confirmed PAF-induced gap formation and FM accumulation at endothelial clefts.",M2
18502110,"Platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) increases NO production in human endothelial cells-real-time monitoring by DAR-4M AM.BACKGROUND: Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent inflammatory lipid mediator that increases vascular permeability and vasodilation. Several studies have addressed the effect of PAF on nitric oxide (NO) production from microvessels in vivo. OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of PAF on NO production in primary cultured human vascular endothelial cells. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were loaded with diaminorhodamine-4M acetoxymethyl ester (DAR-4MAM), and the cells were stimulated with PAF. Intracellular NO production was monitored as increase in fluorescence intensity. Also, NO production was visualized at cellular levels using DAR-4M AM and fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: Significant increases in NO production in HUVECs were soon after the PAF stimulation, reaching a plateau after 10 min of the stimulation. The increase of NO production at 10 min after the stimulation was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) for 0.01-10 microM PAF. PAF-induced NO production was abolished by pretreatment of HUVECs with a NOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or PAF receptor antagonist BN 52021. LysoPAF, the inactive metabolite of PAF, did not exert a significant effect on intracellular NO levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide direct evidence that PAF cause intracellular NO production via activation of PAF receptors in human vascular endothelial cells.",M2
18483284,"Inhibition of photocarcinogenesis by platelet-activating factor or serotonin receptor antagonists.The UV radiation in sunlight is the primary cause of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Moreover, UV exposure induces immune suppression. Early steps in the cascade of events leading to immune suppression are the binding of UV-induced platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) to its receptor and the binding of cis-urocanic acid, a photoreceptor for UVB radiation, to the serotonin (5-HT(2A)) receptor. Here, we tested the hypothesis that blocking the binding of PAF and 5-HT(2A) to their receptors would also block skin cancer induction. Hairless mice were injected with PAF or serotonin receptor antagonists and then exposed to solar-simulated UV radiation. We noted a significant and substantial decrease in skin cancer incidence in mice treated with the PAF or 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. Also, the PAF and/or serotonin receptor antagonists blocked skin cancer progression. The PAF and serotonin receptor antagonists worked in a synergistic fashion to block skin cancer induction. We also measured the effect that injecting PAF and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists had on UV-induced skin damage after a single UV exposure. We noted a significant decrease in UV-induced hypertrophy, sunburn cell formation, and apoptosis when the mice were injected with PAF and/or 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. These data indicate that treating UV-irradiated mice with PAF and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists blocks skin cancer induction in vivo, in part by reversing UV-induced damage to the skin and by preventing the induction of immune suppression.",M2
18442488,"Increased production of the ether-lipid platelet-activating factor in intestinal epithelial cells infected by Salmonella enteritidis.When exposed to enteric pathogens intestinal epithelial cells produce several cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators. To date there is no evidence that the ether-lipid platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is one of these mediators. Our results revealed a significant increase in PAF production by human colonic tissue 4 h after infection by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or Salmonella enteritidis. PAF is produced in the gut by cells of the immune system in response to bacterial infection. To determine whether the epithelial cells of colonic mucosa might also modulate PAF levels, we carried out PAF quantification and analysis of the enzymes involved in PAF synthesis in 5-day-old (undifferentiated) or 28-day-old (differentiated) Caco-2 cell cultures. Infection of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells with either bacterium had no effect on PAF levels, whereas in differentiated cells, infection by S. enteritidis increased PAF levels. Following infection by S. enteritidis, there were no changes in the activity of dithiothreitol-insensitive choline phosphotransferase. However, the enzymes of the remodeling pathway cytosolic phospholipase A(2), which catalyzes the formation of the PAF precursor lysoPAF, and lysoPAF acetyltransferase, are activated in the infected epithelial cells. This response is Ca(2+)-dependent.",M2
18441387,"The platelet activating factor triggers preconditioning-like cardioprotective effect via mitochondrial K-ATP channels and redox-sensible signaling.Endogenous platelet activating factor (<e>PAF</e>) is involved in heart ischemic preconditioning. PAF can also afford pharmacological preconditioning. We studied whether mitochondrial-ATP-sensitive K(+) (mK(ATP)) channels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in PAF-induced cardioprotection. In Group 1 control hearts, Langendorff-perfused rat hearts underwent 30 min ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion. Group 2 hearts, before ischemia, were perfused for 19 min with PAF (2x10(-11) M); Groups 3 and 4 hearts were co-infused with PAF and N-acetyl-L-cysteine or 5-hydroxydecanoate to scavenge ROS or to block mK(ATP) channels, respectively. Left ventricular pressure and infarct size were determined. PAF-pretreatment reduced infarct size (33 +/- 4% vs 64 +/- 4.6 % of the area at risk of control hearts) and improved pressure recovery. Infarct-sparing effect of PAF was abolished by N-acetyl-L-cysteine and 5-hydroxydecanoate. Thus, the cardioprotective effect exerted by PAF-pretreatment involves activation of mK(ATP) channels and redox signaling in pre-ischemic phase.",M2
18441203,"A cardioprotective role for platelet-activating factor through NOS-dependent S-nitrosylation.Controversy exists as to whether platelet-activating factor (<e>PAF</e>), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, can actually protect the heart from postischemic injury. To determine whether endogenous activation of the PAF receptor is cardioprotective, we examined postischemic functional recovery in isolated hearts from wild-type and PAF receptor-knockout mice. Postischemic function was reduced in hearts with targeted deletion of the PAF receptor and in wild-type hearts treated with a PAF receptor antagonist. Furthermore, perfusion with picomolar concentrations of PAF improved postischemic function in hearts from wild-type mice. To elucidate the mechanism of a PAF-mediated cardioprotective effect, we employed a model of intracellular Ca2+ overload and loss of function in nonischemic ventricular myocytes. We found that PAF receptor activation attenuates the time-dependent loss of shortening and increases in intracellular Ca2+ transients in Ca2+ -overloaded myocytes. These protective effects of PAF depend on nitric oxide, but not activation of cGMP. In addition, we found that reversible S-nitrosylation of myocardial proteins must occur in order for PAF to moderate Ca2+ overload and loss of myocyte function. Thus our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level PAF receptor activation initiates nitric oxide-induced S-nitrosylation of Ca2+ -handling proteins, e.g., L-type Ca2+ channels, to attenuate Ca2+ overload during ischemia-reperfusion in the heart. Since inhibition of the PAF protective pathway reduces myocardial postischemic function, our results raise concern that clinical therapies for inflammatory diseases that lead to complete blockade of the PAF receptor may eliminate a significant, endogenous cardioprotective pathway.",M2
