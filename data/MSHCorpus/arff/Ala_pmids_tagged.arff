20404340,"Engineering thrombin for selective specificity toward protein C and PAR1.Thrombin elicits functional responses critical to blood homeostasis by interacting with diverse physiological substrates. <e>Ala</e>-scanning mutagenesis of 97 residues covering 53% of the solvent accessible surface area of the enzyme identifies Trp(215) as the single most important determinant of thrombin specificity. Saturation mutagenesis of Trp(215) produces constructs featuring k(cat)/K(m) values for the hydrolysis of fibrinogen, protease-activated receptor PAR1, and protein C that span five orders of magnitude. Importantly, the effect of Trp(215) replacement is context dependent. Mutant W215E is 10-fold more specific for protein C than fibrinogen and PAR1, which represents a striking shift in specificity relative to wild-type that is 100-fold more specific for fibrinogen and PAR1 than protein C. However, when the W215E mutation is combined with deletion of nine residues in the autolysis loop, which by itself shifts the specificity of the enzyme from fibrinogen and PAR1 to protein C, the resulting construct features significant activity only toward PAR1. These findings demonstrate that thrombin can be re-engineered for selective specificity toward protein C and PAR1. Mutations of Trp(215) provide important reagents for dissecting the multiple functional roles of thrombin in the blood and for clinical applications.",M1
20332332,"Key proteolytic cleavage site and full-length form of DSPP.It is known that dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is processed into NH(2)- and COOH-terminal fragments, but its key cleavage site has not been identified, nor has its full-length form been discovered. The objectives of this study were to identify the key cleavage site during DSPP processing and to search for full-length DSPP in vivo. We generated a construct encoding DSPP, in which Asp(452), a cleavage site residue, was replaced by <e>Ala</e>(452). The pulp-odontoblast complex and dentin were extracted, chromatographically separated, and assessed by Stains-All staining, Western immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. These studies showed that the substitution of Asp(452) by Ala(452) completely blocks the cleavage of mouse DSPP in the transfected cells, indicating that the NH(2)-terminal peptide bond of Asp(452) is essential for the initiation of DSPP proteolytic processing. The results of this study revealed the presence of full-length DSPP and its processed fragments in extracts from the pulp/odontoblast and dentin.",M1
20232870,"Anatomy of a red copper center: spectroscopic identification and reactivity of the copper centers of Bacillus subtilis Sco and its Cys-to-<e>Ala</e> variants.Sco is a mononuclear red copper protein involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. It is spectroscopically similar to red copper nitrosocyanin, but unlike the latter, which has one copper cysteine thiolate, the former has two. In addition to the two cysteine ligands (C45 and C49), the wild-type (WT) protein from Bacillus subtilis (hereafter named BSco) has a histidine (H135) and an unknown endogenous protein oxygen ligand in a distorted tetragonal array. We have compared the properties of the WT protein to variants in which each of the two coordinating Cys residues has been individually mutated to Ala, using UV/visible, Cu and S K-edge X-ray absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Unlike the Cu(II) form of native Sco, the Cu(II) complexes of the Cys variants are unstable. The copper center of C49A undergoes autoreduction to the Cu(I) form, which is shown by extended X-ray absorption fine structure to be composed of a novel two-coordinate center with one Cys and one His ligand. C45A rearranges to a new stable Cu(II) species coordinated by C49, H135 and a second His ligand recruited from a previously uncoordinated protein side chain. The different chemistry exhibited by the Cys variants can be rationalized by whether a stable Cu(I) species can be formed by autoredox chemistry. For C49A, the remaining Cys and His residues are trans, which facilitates the formation of the highly stable two-coordinate Cu(I) species, while for C45A such a configuration cannot be attained. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the WT protein indicates a net weak Cu-S bond strength at approximately 2.24 A corresponding to the two thiolate-copper bonds, whereas the single variant C45A shows a moderately strong Cu-S bond at approximately 2.16 A. S K-edge data give a total covalency of 28% for both Cu-S bonds in the WT protein. These data suggest an average covalency per Cu-S bond lower than that observed for nitrosocyanin and close to that expected for type-2 Cu(II)-thiolate systems. The data are discussed relative to the unique Cu-S characteristics of cupredoxins, from which it is concluded that Sco does not contain highly covalent Cu-S bonds of the type expected for long-range electron-transfer reactivity.",M1
20204202,"Replacement of <e>Ala</e> by Aib improves structuration and biological stability in thymine-based alpha-nucleopeptides.Three thymine-based nucleo-heptapeptides, each containing two nucleo-amino acids and zero, one or four Aib residues, respectively, have been synthesized. A single Aib residue is enough to promote the adoption of a helical structure in our nucleopeptides and to increase significantly their resistance towards enzymatic degradation. The insertion of four Aib residues, out of seven residues in the sequence, affords a rigid, 3(10)-helical nucleopeptide that is substantially unaffected by serum enzymes and is not cytotoxic.",M1
20196828,"A novel HLA-B allele, B*5535, was identified by sequence-based typing in a Chinese individual.A novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B allele, B*5535, has been identified in a Chinese individual by sequence-based typing, which has seven nucleotide changes from the closest matching allele B*5502 resulting in two amino acids changes: 69 Glu--&gt;Met; 70 Glu--&gt;<e>Ala</e>.",M1
20110468,"N-terminal acetylation of cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals.The retained N-terminal methionine (Met) residue of a nascent protein is often N-terminally acetylated (Nt-acetylated). Removal of N-terminal Met by Met-aminopeptidases frequently leads to Nt-acetylation of the resulting N-terminal alanine (<e>Ala</e>), valine (Val), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and cysteine (Cys) residues. Although a majority of eukaryotic proteins (for example, more than 80% of human proteins) are cotranslationally Nt-acetylated, the function of this extensively studied modification is largely unknown. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that the Nt-acetylated Met residue could act as a degradation signal (degron), targeted by the Doa10 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, Doa10 also recognized the Nt-acetylated Ala, Val, Ser, Thr, and Cys residues. Several examined proteins of diverse functions contained these N-terminal degrons, termed AcN-degrons, which are a prevalent class of degradation signals in cellular proteins.",M1
20104847,"Transport of the advanced glycation end products alanylpyrraline and pyrralylalanine by the human proton-coupled peptide transporter hPEPT1.The glycation compound pyrraline, which originates from the advanced Maillard reaction, appears in urine after consumption of pyrraline-containing food. We hypothesized that the absorption of pyrraline occurs in the form of dipeptides rather than the free amino acid. The human intestinal peptide transporter hPEPT1 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. In hPEPT1-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with empty vector, the uptake of [(14)C]glycylsarcosine was strongly inhibited by alanylpyrraline (<e>Ala</e>-Pyrr) and pyrralylalanine (Pyrr-Ala). Free pyrraline did not inhibit peptide uptake. In Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human PEPT1, both Ala-Pyrr and Pyrr-Ala generated significant inward directed currents. In a third approach, uptake of the dipeptides into hPEPT1-transfected HeLa cells was analyzed by HPLC. Ala-Pyrr and Pyrr-Ala were taken up by hPEPT1-expressing cells at a 4- to 7-fold higher rate than by HeLa cells transfected with the empty vector. We conclude that pyrraline containing dipeptides are transported by hPEPT1 in an electrogenic manner into intestinal cells.",M1
20100277,"Relevance of conserved lysine and arginine residues in transmembrane helices for the transport activity of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) (SLCO1B3) mediates the uptake of endogenous substrates (e.g. estrone-3-sulphate) and drugs (e.g. pravastatin) from blood into hepatocytes. Structure-based modelling of OATP1B3 suggested that a pore with a positive electrostatic potential contributes to the transport mechanism. Therefore, we investigated the role of conserved positively charged amino acids for OATP1B3-mediated uptake of sulphobromophthalein (BSP) and pravastatin. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Residues Lys28, Lys41 and Arg580 in OATP1B3 were substituted by alanine, arginine, glutamine, glycine or lysine. Using immunofluorescence, immunoblot analysis and cellular uptake assays, the effect of these mutations on protein expression and transport activity was investigated. KEY RESULTS: Immunofluorescence revealed that all mutants were localized in the plasma membrane with partial intracellular retention of the Arg580&gt;<e>Ala</e> and Arg580&gt;Lys mutants. Lys41&gt;Ala, Lys41&gt;Gln, Lys41&gt;Gly, Arg580&gt;Gly and Arg580&gt;Lys showed significantly reduced transport for BSP and pravastatin. Kinetic analyses of BSP transport revealed a significant reduction of V(max) normalized to cell surface protein expression for Lys41&gt;Ala (wild type: 190 +/- 8, Lys41&gt;Ala:16 +/- 4 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P &lt; 0.001), whereas V(max) of Lys41&gt;Arg and Arg580&gt;Lys (103 +/- 8 and 123 +/- 14 pmol (mg protein)(-1) min(-1), P &gt; 0.05) did not change significantly. This suggests that the positive charges at positions 41 and 580 are important for transport activity of BSP. Structural modelling indicated that the positively charged side chain of Lys41 is flexible within the pore. The orientation of Arg580 is defined by adjacent residues Glu74 and Asn77, which was confirmed by kinetic analysis of Glu74&gt;Ala. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We demonstrated that the conserved positively charged amino acids Lys41 and Arg580 are pivotal to the transport activity of OATP1B3.",M1
20091672,"Model peptide-based system used for the investigation of metal ions binding to histidine-containing polypeptides.The reaction of histidine-containing polypeptides with toxic and essential metals and the molecular mechanism of complexation has yet to be determined, particularly with respect to the conformational changes of the interacting macromolecules. Therefore, a system of oligopeptides containing histidine residues in various positions of <e>Ala</e> or Gly sequences has been designed and used in heavy metal comparatively binding experiments. The role of spacing residues (Gly and Ala repeats) in selecting the various conformations was investigated. The newly synthesized peptides and metal ion adducts have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD). The analysis of CD-spectra of the four peptides in water revealed that the secondary structure depends much on the position of each amino acid in the peptide backbone. Our peptides system reveals various binding mechanisms of metal ions to peptides depending on the position of histidine residue and the corresponding conformations of Ala or Gly sequences. Biological and medical consequences of conformational changes of metal-bound peptides are further discussed. Thus, the binding of heavy metals to four peptides may serve as a model system with respect to the conformational consequences of the metal addition on the amino acid repeats situated in prion protein.",M1
20065709,"Sensitivity comparison of two L-alanine doped blends to different photon energies.Blends of L-alanine (85% weight proportion) with KI (10%) and with PbI2 (10%), these last two compounds acting as dopants, and with PVA (5%) acting as binder, were prepared in water at 80 degrees C. A blend of pure L-alanine (95%) with PVA (5%) was also prepared. The three blends were irradiated with photon beams of different energies (120 kV, Co, and 10 MV) to a unique dose of 30 Gy to compare their sensitivities for those three energies. EPR spectra of the three irradiated blends were recorded in a K-Band spectrometer (24 GHz) taking aliquots of about 4 mg for each blend. The energy sensitivity of a blend was defined as the peak-to-peak amplitude of its EPR spectrum central line. For the Co energy (1.25 MeV) the blends presented practically the same sensitivity, indicating that the presence of the dopants does not affect the sensitivity of L-alanine. For 10 MV x-rays, there was an increment (around 10%-20%) in sensitivity for the two L-alanine doped blends compared with the pure L-alanine blend (not doped). In the case of 120 kV x-rays, the blends <e>ala</e>+KI and ala+PbI showed increments of 10 and 20 times more sensitivity than the pure L-alanine blend. It is concluded that the dopants KI and PbI2 produce a great enhancement of the L-alanine sensitivity to low-energy photons. For the same dopant's content (10%) in the blend, PbI2 showed a better performance. Increasing the PbI2 proportion (30%) in the blend allows the detection of radiation dose as low as 10 mGy for 120 kV x-rays. These results encourage the authors to try to enhance the sensitivity of L-alanine even more by increasing the dopant's content in the blend and diminishing the lower limit detection. Application of these L-alanine doped blends in the dosimetry in diagnostic radiology could be possible.",M1
20063889,"A series of alpha-amino acid ester prodrugs of camptothecin: in vitro hydrolysis and A549 human lung carcinoma cell cytotoxicity.The objective of the present study was to identify a camptothecin (CPT) prodrug with optimal release and cytotoxicity properties for immobilization on a passively targeted microparticle delivery system. A series of alpha-amino acid ester prodrugs of CPT were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated. Four CPT prodrugs were synthesized with increasing aliphatic chain length (glycine (Gly) (2a), alanine (<e>Ala</e>) (2b), aminobutyric acid (Abu) (2c), and norvaline (Nva) (2d)). Prodrug reconversion was studied at pH 6.6, 7.0, and 7.4 corresponding to tumor, lung, and extracellular/physiological pH, respectively. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in A549 human lung carcinoma cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The hydrolytic reconversion rate to parent CPT increased with decreasing side chain length as well as increasing pH. The Hill slope of 2d was significantly less than CPT and the other prodrugs tested, indicating a higher cell death rate at lower concentrations. These results suggest that 2d is the best candidate for a passively targeted sustained release lung delivery system.",M1
20059533,"Co-inheritance of Hb Hershey [beta70(E14) <e>Ala</e>--&gt;Gly] and Hb La Pommeraie [beta133(H11)Val--&gt;Met] in a Sicilian subject.OBJECTIVES: This report represents the first observation in Sicily of two rare beta-globin gene variants, Hb Hershey [beta70(E14) Ala--&gt;Gly] and Hb La Pommeraie [beta133(H11)Val--&gt;Met], found in a 35-year-old male patient from Messina, in the north-east of Sicily during population screening for hemoglobinopathies. METHODS: The occurrence of the Hb variants was assessed by cation exchange chromatography while complete blood counts were obtained using automatic cell counters. Red cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoresis at alkaline and acid pH. Stability of hemoglobin was checked by the isopropanol precipitation test and by the heat tests while inclusion bodies and reticulocyte count were determined by incubation of blood samples with brilliant cresyl blue. Molecular analysis was performed by DNA sequencing of beta- and alpha-globin genes. RESULTS: We observed an abnormally high performance liquid chromatography elution with a slight reduction in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin parameters and mutations at codon 70 GCC--&gt;GGC (Hb Hershey) and at codon 133 GTG--&gt;ATG (Hb La Pommeraie) in beta-globin gene. CONCLUSION: Family analysis of three generations demonstrated the presence of these two mutations in trans. So it was possible to describe the phenotypes of these variants in a heterozygous state and in double heterozygous state.",M1
20052993,"Investigation of anticapsin biosynthesis reveals a four-enzyme pathway to tetrahydrotyrosine in Bacillus subtilis.Bacillus subtilis produces the antibiotic anticapsin as an L-<e>Ala</e>-L-anticapsin dipeptide precursor known as bacilysin, whose synthesis is encoded by the bacA-D genes and the adjacent ywfGH genes. To evaluate the biosynthesis of the epoxycyclohexanone amino acid anticapsin from the primary metabolite prephenate, we have overproduced, purified, and characterized the activity of the BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG proteins. BacA is an unusual prephenate decarboxylase that avoids the typical aromatization of the cyclohexadienol ring by protonating C(8) to produce an isomerized structure. BacB then catalyzes an allylic isomerization, generating a conjugated dienone with a 295 nm chromophore. Both the BacA and BacB products are regioisomers of H(2)HPP (dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate). The BacB product is then a substrate for the short chain reductase YwfH which catalyzes the conjugate addition of hydride at the C(4) olefinic terminus using NADH to yield the cyclohexenol-containing tetrahydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate H(4)HPP. In turn, this keto acid is a substrate for YwfG, which promotes transamination (with L-Phe as amino donor), to form tetrahydrotyrosine (H(4)Tyr). Thus BacA, BacB, YwfH, and YwfG act in sequence in a four enzyme pathway to make H(4)Tyr, which has not previously been identified in B. subtilis but is a recognized building block in cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptides such as micropeptins and aeruginopeptins.",M1
20048169,"Intra- and interdomain effects due to mutation of calcium-binding sites in calmodulin.The IQ-motif protein PEP-19, binds to the C-domain of calmodulin (CaM) with significantly different k(on) and k(off) rates in the presence and absence of Ca(2+), which could play a role in defining the levels of free CaM during Ca(2+) transients. The initial goal of the current study was to determine whether Ca(2+) binding to sites III or IV in the C-domain of CaM was responsible for affecting the kinetics of binding PEP-19. EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding sites were selectively inactivated by the common strategy of changing Asp to <e>Ala</e> at the X-coordination position. Although Ca(2+) binding to both sites III and IV appeared necessary for native-like interactions with PEP-19, the data also indicated that the mutations caused undesirable structural alterations as evidenced by significant changes in amide chemical shifts for apoCaM. Mutations in the C-domain also affected chemical shifts in the unmodified N-domain, and altered the Ca(2+) binding properties of the N-domain. Conversion of Asp(93) to Ala caused the greatest structural perturbations, possibly due to the loss of stabilizing hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asp(93) and backbone amides in apo loop III. Thus, although these mutations inhibit binding of Ca(2+), the mutated CaM may not be able to support potentially important native-like activity of the apoprotein. This should be taken into account when designing CaM mutants for expression in cell culture.",M1
20043997,"A single amino acid residue, <e>Ala</e> 105, confers 16alpha-hydroxylase activity to human cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase.In adrenal steroidogenesis, CYP17 catalyses the 17alpha-hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone and the subsequent 17,20-lyase reaction, yielding adrenal androgens. The enzyme exhibits distinctly different selectivities towards these substrates in various species. CYP17 has also been shown to exhibit 16alpha-hydroxylase activity towards progesterone in some species, with only human and chimp CYP17 catalysing the biosynthesis of substantial amounts of 16-OHprogesterone. The 16alpha-hydroxylase activity was investigated by introducing an Ala105Leu substitution into human CYP17. The converse mutation, Leu105Ala was introduced into the baboon, goat and pig enzymes. Wt human CYP17 converted approximately 30% progesterone to 16-OHprogesterone while the Ala105Leu mutant converted negligible amounts to 16-OHprogesterone ( approximately 9%), comparable to wt CYP17 of the other three species when expressed in COS-1 cells. The ratio of 17-hydroxylated products to 16-OHprogesterone of human CYP17 was 2.7 and that of the mutant human construct 10.5. Similar ratios were observed for human and goat CYP17 with the corresponding Ala or Leu residues. Although the Leu105Ala mutation of both baboon and pig CYP17 exhibited the same trend regarding the ratios, the rate of progesterone conversion was reduced. Coexpression with cytochrome b(5) significantly decreased the ratio of 17-hydroxylated products to 16-OHprogesterone in the Leu105 constructs, while effects were negligible with Ala at this position. Homology models show that Ala105 faces towards the active pocket in the predicted B'-C domain of CYP17. The smaller residue allows more flexibility of movement in the active pocket than Leu, presenting both the C16 and C17 of progesterone to the iron-oxy complex.",M1
20034620,"Structural characterization of teichoic acids from Lactobacillus brevis.Teichoic acids are a major constituent of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Structural characterization of lipoteichoic and teichoic acids isolated from Lactobacillus brevis was undertaken using 1D and 2D NMR experiments as well as chemical methodology. Compositional analysis indicated the presence of high amounts of glycerol, glucose, and alanine. In the case of LTA octadecenoic acid was also detected. The basic LTA/WTA structure was identified as 1,3-poly(glycerol phosphate) nonstoichiometrically substituted at C-2 of the glycerol residues with D-<e>Ala</e> or alpha-D-Glc. In the case of LTA a higher amount of Ala could be detected and partial alanylation at position C-6 of the Glc could also be observed.",M1
20010690,"Paradox of mistranslation of serine for alanine caused by AlaRS recognition dilemma.Mistranslation arising from confusion of serine for alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetases (AlaRSs) has profound functional consequences. Throughout evolution, two editing checkpoints prevent disease-causing mistranslation from confusing glycine or serine for alanine at the active site of AlaRS. In both bacteria and mice, Ser poses a bigger challenge than Gly. One checkpoint is the AlaRS editing centre, and the other is from widely distributed AlaXps-free-standing, genome-encoded editing proteins that clear Ser-tRNA(<e>Ala</e>). The paradox of misincorporating both a smaller (glycine) and a larger (serine) amino acid suggests a deep conflict for nature-designed AlaRS. Here we show the chemical basis for this conflict. Nine crystal structures, together with kinetic and mutational analysis, provided snapshots of adenylate formation for each amino acid. An inherent dilemma is posed by constraints of a structural design that pins down the alpha-amino group of the bound amino acid by using an acidic residue. This design, dating back more than 3 billion years, creates a serendipitous interaction with the serine OH that is difficult to avoid. Apparently because no better architecture for the recognition of alanine could be found, the serine misactivation problem was solved through free-standing AlaXps, which appeared contemporaneously with early AlaRSs. The results reveal unconventional problems and solutions arising from the historical design of the protein synthesis machinery.",M1
20000401,"In-capillary derivatization and stacking electrophoretic analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine in tea samples to redeem the detection after dilution to decrease matrix interference.An in-capillary derivatization and stacking capillary electrophoresis (CE) technique has been applied to redeem the detection of dilute analytes in the analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (<e>Ala</e>) in tea samples. Extracts from samples were diluted to eliminate matrix interference before introduction into the CE system. GABA and Ala in the diluted sample zone were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol (OPA/2-ME) to form fluorescence-labeled products in the stacking process, and the labeled derivatives were then enriched by online stacking. Optimal conditions for the stacking, such as the concentration of the background buffer solution, the matrix of the sample zone (sample solution), and the volume of the sample injection, were investigated and then applied to real sample analysis. Under optimum conditions, the detections were linear in the range of 5.0 nM-2.5 microM with the square of correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.9995 and 0.9992 for GABA and Ala, respectively. Detection limits were found to be 0.7 and 0.8 nM for GABA and Ala, respectively. Tea samples were analyzed with recoveries between 92.33 and 97.87% and between 94.36 and 96.46% for GABA and Ala, respectively. This method is a rapid, convenient, and sensitive process for determining GABA and Ala in complicated matrix samples such as tea samples.",M1
19954785,"Control of impurities in L-aspartic acid and L-alanine by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a corona charged aerosol detector.In this study a reversed phase ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method using charged aerosol detection (CAD) was developed and fully validated for the pharmaceutical quality control of L-aspartic acid (Asp). With a slight modification, the method also allows the evaluation of related substances in L-alanine (<e>Ala</e>). The method enables simultaneous control of related amino acids and of possibly occurring organic acids contaminants. A minimum limit of quantification of 0.03% could be achieved for all occurring related substances. Moreover, the detector sensitivity of the CAD was compared with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). Depending on the analyte the CAD was found to be 3.6-42 times more sensitive than the ELSD. The HPLC method was applied to the purity testing of 8 samples of pharmaceutical grade and reagent grade Asp and of 12 samples of Ala supplied by various manufacturers. Both substances were found to be of high purity (greater than 99.8% for Asp and greater than 99.9% for Ala). Malic acid and Ala were the major impurities in Asp. Asp and glutamic acid (Glu) were the only detectable impurities in Ala.",M1
19948834,"Alanine mutagenesis of the primary antigenic escape residue cluster, c1, of apical membrane antigen 1.Antibodies against apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) inhibit invasion of Plasmodium merozoites into red cells, and a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms on AMA1 allow the parasite to escape inhibitory antibodies. The availability of a crystal structure makes it possible to test protein engineering strategies to develop a monovalent broadly reactive vaccine. Previously, we showed that a linear stretch of polymorphic residues (amino acids 187 to 207), localized within the C1 cluster on domain 1, conferred the highest level of escape from inhibitory antibodies, and these were termed antigenic escape residues (AER). Here we test the hypothesis that immunodampening the C1 AER will divert the immune system toward more conserved regions. We substituted seven C1 AER of the FVO strain Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 with alanine residues (<e>ALA</e>). The resulting ALA protein was less immunogenic than the native protein in rabbits. Anti-ALA antibodies contained a higher proportion of cross-reactive domain 2 and domain 3 antibodies and had higher avidity than anti-FVO. No overall enhancement of cross-reactive inhibitory activity was observed when anti-FVO and anti-ALA sera were compared for their ability to inhibit invasion. Alanine mutations at the C1 AER had shifted the immune response toward cross-strain-reactive epitopes that were noninhibitory, refuting the hypothesis but confirming the importance of the C1 cluster as an inhibitory epitope. We further demonstrate that naturally occurring polymorphisms that fall within the C1 cluster can predict escape from cross-strain invasion inhibition, reinforcing the importance of the C1 cluster genotype for antigenic categorization and allelic shift analyses in future phase 2b trials.",M1
19948720,"Binding and orientation of tricyclic antidepressants within the central substrate site of the human serotonin transporter.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been used for decades, but their orientation within and molecular interactions with their primary target is yet unsettled. The recent finding of a TCA binding site in the extracellular vestibule of the bacterial leucine transporter 11 A above the central site has prompted debate about whether this vestibular site in the bacterial transporter is applicable to binding of antidepressants to their relevant physiological target, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT). We present an experimentally validated structural model of imipramine and analogous TCAs in the central substrate binding site of hSERT. Two possible binding modes were observed from induced fit docking calculations. We experimentally validated a single binding mode by combining mutagenesis of hSERT with uptake inhibition studies of different TCA analogs according to the paired mutation ligand analog complementation paradigm. Using this experimental method, we identify a salt bridge between the tertiary aliphatic amine and Asp(98). Furthermore, the 7-position of the imipramine ring is found vicinal to Phe(335), and the pocket lined by <e>Ala</e>(173) and Thr(439) is utilized by 3-substituents. These protein-ligand contact points unambiguously orient the TCA within the central binding site and reveal differences between substrate binding and inhibitor binding, giving important clues to the inhibition mechanism. Consonant with the well established competitive inhibition of uptake by TCAs, the resulting binding site for TCAs in hSERT is fully overlapping with the serotonin binding site in hSERT and dissimilar to the low affinity noncompetitive TCA site reported in the leucine transporter (LeuT).",M1
19924838,"Conformational effects of the non-natural alpha-methylserine on small peptides and glycopeptides.The synthesis and the conformational analysis in aqueous solution of a peptide and a glycopeptide containing the sequence threonine-alanine-alanine (Thr-<e>Ala</e>-Ala) are reported. Furthermore, the threonine residue has been replaced by the quaternary amino acid alpha-methylserine (MeSer) and their corresponding non-natural peptide and glycopeptide are also studied. The conformational analysis in aqueous solution combines NOEs and coupling constants data with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with time-averaged restraints. The study reveals that the beta-O-glycosylation produces a remarkable and completely different effect on the backbone of the peptide derived from Thr and MeSer. In the former, the beta-O-glycosylation is responsible for the experimentally observed shift from extended conformations (peptide) to folded ones (glycopeptide). In contrast, the beta-O-glycosylation of the MeSer-containing peptide, which clearly shows two main conformations in aqueous solution [extended ones (70%) and beta-turn (30%)], causes a high degree of flexibility for the backbone.",M1
19908203,"Identification of a novel antitumor peptide based on the screening of an <e>Ala</e>-library derived from the LALF(32-51) region.Novel therapeutic peptides are increasingly making their way into clinical application. The cationic and amphipathic properties of certain peptides allow them to cross biological membranes in a non-disruptive way without apparent toxicity increasing drug bioavailability. By modifying the primary structure of the Limulus-derived LALF(32-51) peptide we designed a novel peptide, L-2, with antineoplastic effect and cell-penetrating capacity. Interestingly, L-2 induced cellular cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor cell lines and systemic injection into immunocompetent and nude mice bearing established solid tumor, resulted in substantial regression of the tumor mass and apoptosis. To isolate the gene transcripts specifically regulated by L-2 in tumor cells, we conducted suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and identified a set of genes involved in biological processes relevant to cancer biology. Our findings describe a novel peptide that modifies the gene expression of the tumor cells and exhibits antitumor effect in vivo, indicating that peptide L-2 is a potential candidate for anticancer therapy.",M1
19903477,"Changeability of individual domains of an aminoacyl-tRNA in polymerization by the ribosome.The changeabilities of individual modules of aminoacyl-tRNAs are poorly understood, despite the relevance for evolution, translational accuracy and incorporation of unnatural amino acids (AAs). Here, we dissect the effect of successive changes in four domains of <e>Ala</e>-tRNA(3)(Ala) on translation in a purified system. Incorporating five AAs, not one, was necessary to reveal major effects on yields of peptide products. Omitting tRNA modifications had little affect, but anticodon mutations were very inhibitory. Surprisingly, changing the terminal CCA to CdCA was sometimes inhibitory and non-cognate AAs were sometimes compensatory. Results have implications for translational fidelity and engineering.",M1
19903464,"Block effect of capsaicin on hERG potassium currents is enhanced by S6 mutation at Y652.The objectives of this study were to investigate the inhibitory action of capsaicin on wild-type (WT) and mutation human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel currents (I(hERG)), and to determine whether mutations in the S6 region are significant for the inhibition of I(hERG) by capsaicin. The hERG channel (WT, Y652A and F656A) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using standard two-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques. The results show that capsaicin blocks WT hERG in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 17.45microM and a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve. Characteristics of blockade were consistent with capsaicin causing components of block in both the closed and open channel states. However, mutating the Y652 residue to <e>Ala</e> enhances the blockade effect of capsaicin with an IC(50) of 4.11microM, whereas mutation of F656A does not significantly alter drug potency. Simultaneously, for Y652A, the steady-state activation parameter is shifted to a more positive value by 5mV and the inactivation parameter is shifted to a more negative value by -29mV in the presence of 25microM capsaicin. In conclusion, capsaicin blocks hERG channels by binding to both the closed and open channel states.Y652 was important as a molecular determinant of blockade. Mutation Y652A enhances the drug block, which may cause some patients to be particularly sensitive to capsaicin clinically.",M1
19900509,"A new beta-chain haemoglobin variant with increased oxygen affinity: Hb Roma [beta115(g17)<e>Ala</e>--&gt;Val].BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin Roma [beta115(G17)Ala--&gt;Val] is a new adult haemoglobin variant found in a patient presenting a mild hypochromia and microcytosis. We studied this previously uncharacterised variant in order to evaluate the effect on the structural and funcional properties of the Ala--&gt;Val substitution at the alpha1beta1 interface. METHODS AND RESULTS: The variant chain was identified by direct DNA sequencing of the beta-globin gene, which revealed a GCC--&gt;GTC mutation in codon 115. This mutation was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the tetramers and peptides. The oxygen-binding properties of the haemoglobin A/haemoglobin Roma mixture, in which the variant makes up 25% of the haemoglobins, showed a significant increase in oxygen affinity with respect to normal haemoglobin A, both in the absence and presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The role of the betaG17 position, situated at the alpha(1)beta(1) interface, has been examined using computational models of haemoglobin Roma and other known betaG17 variants, in comparison with normal haemoglobin A. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the beta115(G17)Ala--&gt;Val substitution at the alpha1beta1 interface is responsible for increased oxygen affinity and mild destabilisation of the haemoglobin Roma. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: An amino acid substitution at the G17 position of the alpha1beta1 interface may result in stabilisation of the high affinity R-state of the haemoglobin molecule.",M1
19884265,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 Ala17 polymorphism is a genetic marker of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency: Italian association study and meta-analysis of European studies.OBJECTIVE: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) gene polymorphism has been associated with human autoimmune diseases, but discordant data are available on its association with autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD). We tested the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent association of CTLA4+49 (A/G) (<e>Ala</e> 17) and/or CTLA4 CT60 (A/G) polymorphism with AAD. DESIGN: DNA samples from 180 AAD patients and 394 healthy control subjects from continental Italy were analyzed, and association statistical analyses and meta-analysis of published studies were performed. Methods TaqMan minor groove binder chemistry assays and PCR fragment length polymorphism assays were used. RESULTS: Frequency of allele G of CTLA4+49 was significantly increased among AAD patients (40% alleles) than among healthy controls (27% alleles; P&lt;0.0001). CTLA4 CT60 polymorphism was associated with AAD only in the heterozygous A/G individuals. The frequency of +49 AG+GG genotypes was significantly higher among AAD patients than among healthy control subjects, in both a co-dominant (P&lt;0.0001) and G dominant model (P&lt;0.0001). CTLA4+49 allele G was significantly associated with disease risk in both patients with isolated AAD and in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CTLA4+49 allele G was positively associated with AAD (P&lt;0.0001, odds ratio (OR)=2.43, 95% confidence interval=1.54-3.86) also after correction for DRB1*03-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201, DRB1*04-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302, and sex. Meta-analysis of five studies revealed a significant association of CTLA4+49 allele G with AAD (P&lt;0.0001) with an overall OR of 1.48 (1.28-1.71). CONCLUSIONS: The CTLA4+49 polymorphism is strongly associated with genetic risk for AAD, independently from the well-known association with HLA class II genes.",M1
19884027,"Kinetic modeling of hyperpolarized 13C1-pyruvate metabolism in normal rats and TRAMP mice.PURPOSE: To investigate metabolic exchange between (13)C(1)-pyruvate, (13)C(1)-lactate, and (13)C(1)-alanine in pre-clinical model systems using kinetic modeling of dynamic hyperpolarized (13)C spectroscopic data and to examine the relationship between fitted parameters and dose-response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic (13)C spectroscopy data were acquired in normal rats, wild type mice, and mice with transgenic prostate tumors (TRAMP) either within a single slice or using a one-dimensional echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (1D-EPSI) encoding technique. Rate constants were estimated by fitting a set of exponential equations to the dynamic data. Variations in fitted parameters were used to determine model robustness in 15 mm slices centered on normal rat kidneys. Parameter values were used to investigate differences in metabolism between and within TRAMP and wild type mice. RESULTS: The kinetic model was shown here to be robust when fitting data from a rat given similar doses. In normal rats, Michaelis-Menten kinetics were able to describe the dose-response of the fitted exchange rate constants with a 13.65% and 16.75% scaled fitting error (SFE) for k(pyr--&gt;lac) and k(pyr--&gt;<e>ala</e>), respectively. In TRAMP mice, k(pyr--&gt;lac) increased an average of 94% after up to 23 days of disease progression, whether the mice were untreated or treated with casodex. Parameters estimated from dynamic (13)C 1D-EPSI data were able to differentiate anatomical structures within both wild type and TRAMP mice. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic parameters estimated using this approach may be useful for in vivo monitoring of tumor progression and treatment efficacy, as well as to distinguish between various tissues based on metabolic activity.",M1
19883076,"Kinetic analysis of cysteine desulfurase CD0387 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803: formation of the persulfide intermediate.Stopped-flow absorption and isotope effect experiments have been used to dissect the mechanism of formation of the enzyme cysteinyl persulfide intermediate in the reaction of a cysteine desulfurase (CD), CD0387 from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. Seven accumulating intermediates have been identified and tentatively mapped onto the CD chemical mechanism originally proposed by Dean, White, and co-workers [Zheng, L., White, R. H., Cash, V. L., and Dean, D. R. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 4714-4720]. The first intermediate with lambda(max) approximately 350 nm is assigned as either a gem-diamine complex or a thiol adduct formed by nucleophilic attack of either the amine group or the sulfhydryl group of the substrate on the internal aldimine form of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The second intermediate, with absorption features at approximately 417 and approximately 340 nm, is assigned as Cys aldimine and Cys ketimine forms in rapid equilibrium. In agreement with this assignment, a significant substrate alpha-deuterium equilibrium isotope effect ((2)H-EIE) favoring the aldimine form (417 nm) is observed in the second state produced in either wild-type CD0387 or the inactive C326A variant protein, which lacks the nucleophilic cysteine residue and is thus unable to proceed beyond this state unless  rescued  by a high concentration of an exogenous thiol. The third intermediate has an additional approximately 506 nm feature, characteristic of a quinonoid form, along with the features of the previous state. Its assignment as <e>Ala</e> aldimine, quinonoid, and ketimine forms in rapid equilibrium, which associates its formation with C-S bond cleavage and persulfide formation, is supported by its failure to develop in the C326A variant and the normal kinetic isotope effect ((2)H-KIE) on its formation, which is similar in magnitude to the (2)H-EIE disfavoring Cys-ketimine (from which the third state forms) in the second state. Decay of the Ala quinonoid absorption is tentatively attributed to a conformational change by the enzyme that disfavors this form in its equilibrium with Ala aldimine and Ala ketimine. Subsequent decay of the ketimine absorption ( approximately 340 nm) is attributed to release of Ala from the cofactor with an observed rate constant of 10 s(-1), the slowest step in the persulfide-forming half-reaction. The enzyme-persulfide.Ala complex dissociates rapidly with a K(d) of 98 mM. The final state with lambda(max) approximately 350 nm is assigned as a dead-end complex between the enzyme-persulfide and a second l-cysteine, which adds to the cofactor via its sulfhydryl group, possibly forming a cyclic thiazolidine species.",M1
19877579,"The heparin binding motif of endostatin mediates its interaction with receptor nucleolin.Endostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor with heparin-dependent activities. Nucleolin, a novel functional receptor of endostatin, mediates both the internalization to endothelial cells and the antiangiogenic activity of endostatin. To define the exact role of the heparin binding motif in mediating the interaction between endostatin and its receptor nucleolin, up to six arginine residues (R155, R158, R184, R270, R193, and R194) located in the heparin binding motif of endostatin were substituted by alanine to make double, quadruple, or hexad point mutations, respectively. Contributions of the heparin binding motif to both the interaction with nucleolin and the biological activities of endostatin were investigated from in vitro to in vivo. Here we show that Arg to <e>Ala</e> point mutagenesis of the heparin binding motif does not interrupt the folding of endostatin but significantly impairs the interaction between endostatin and nucleolin. Double and quadruple mutants showed significantly decreased internalization to endothelial cells and antitumor activities, while the hexad Arg to Ala mutant completely lost its interaction with nucleolin and biological functions. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the arginine clusters in the heparin binding motif of endostatin significantly contribute to its interaction with receptor nucleolin and mediate the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of endostatin.",M1

The structure of the membrane-perturbing antibiotic alamethicin in DMPC bilayers was analyzed in terms of two angles tau and rho from six such constraints, showing that the N-terminus (up to a kink at Pro14) is folded as an alpha-helix, tilted away from the membrane normal by 8 degrees, and assembled as an oligomer. The new (19)F NMR label CF(3)-<e>Ala</e> has thus been demonstrated to be highly sensitive, virtually unperturbing, and ideally suited to characterize peptaibols in membranes.",M1
19826919,"L-Alanine augments rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance in cucumber.Bacillus vallismortis strain EXTN-1 is a proven biotic elicitor of systemic resistance in many crops against various pathogens. L: -Alanine (<e>Ala</e>) was tested in cucumber as a chemical elicitor of induced systemic resistance (ISR) against Colletotrichum orbiculare. In the greenhouse, both Ala and EXTN-1 induced significant levels of disease suppression in cucumber against anthracnose. When cucumber plants were treated with EXTN-1 and Ala together, augmentative disease suppression was observed. Experiments with transgenic tobacco plants carrying pathogenesis-related genes fused with the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reported gene (PR-1a::GUS &amp; PDF 1.2::GUS) showed an enhanced activation of both PR-1a and PDF 1.2 genes upon combined treatment with Ala and EXTN-1. RT-PCR analysis with transgenic (PR-1a or PDF 1.2 over expressing) Arabidopsis plant showed more enhanced expression of resistance genes PR-1a and PDF 1.2 upon combined treatment with Ala and EXTN-1 than either alone. An augmentative ISR effect, when the bacterial elicitor and chemical elicitor were combined together, was confirmed.",M1

19822347,"Formation of chloroform during chlorination of alanine in drinking water.Currently, dissolved nitrogenous organic matters in water, important precursors of disinfection by-products (DBPs), are of significant concern. This study was to explore the formation of chloroform (CF) during chlorination of alanine (<e>Ala</e>), an important nitrogenous organic compound commonly present in water sources. Our results indicated that the CF yield reached a maximum value of 0.143% at the molar ratio of chlorine atom to nitrogen atom (Cl/N)=1.0 over a Cl/N range of 0.2-5.0 (pH=7.0, reaction time=5d, and initial Ala=0.1mM). At an acidic-neutral condition (pH 4-7), the formation of CF was suppressed. However, the highest CF yield (0.227%) occurred at weakly alkaline condition (pH 8.0) (initial Ala=0.1mM, and Cl/N=1.0). The increase of Br(-) in water can increase total trihalomethanes (THMs) and bromo-THMs. However, the bromo-THMs level reached a plateau at Br(-)/Cl&gt;0.04. Finally, based on the computation of frontier electron density and identification and measurement of key intermediates during Ala chlorination, we proposed a formation pathway of CF from Ala chlorination: Ala--&gt;monochloro-N-alanine (MC-N-Ala)--&gt;acetaldehyde (AAld)--&gt;monochloroacetaldehyde acetaldehyde (MCAld)--&gt;dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAld)--&gt;trichloroacetaldehyde (TCAld)--&gt;CF.",M1
19778418,"Mutagenesis of the fusion peptide-like domain of hepatitis C virus E1 glycoprotein: involvement in cell fusion and virus entry.BACKGROUND: Envelope (E) glycoprotein E2 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediates binding of the virus to target cell receptors. Nevertheless, the precise role of E1 in viral entry remains elusive. METHODS: To understand the involvement of the fusion peptide-like domain positioned at residues 264 to 290 within envelope glycoprotein E1 in HCV infection, mutants with <e>Ala</e> and Asn substitutions for residues conserved between HCV and E proteins of flaviviruses or the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and their effects on membrane fusion and viral infectivity were examined. RESULTS: None of these mutations affected the synthesis or cell surface expression of envelope proteins, nor did they alter the formation of a non-covalent E1-E2 heterodimer or E2 binding to the large extracellular loop of CD81. The Cys residues located at positions 272 and 281 were unlikely involved in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond formation. With the exception of the G267A mutant, which showed increased cell fusion, other mutants displayed reduced or marginally inhibited cell fusion capacities compared to the wild-type (WT) E1E2. The G267A mutant was also an exception in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/HCV E1E2 pseudotyping analyses, in that it showed higher one-cycle infectivity; all other mutants exhibited greatly or partially reduced viral entry versus the WT pseudotype. All but the G278A and D279N mutants showed a WT-like profile of E1E2 incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Since C272A, C281A, G282A, and G288A pseudotypes bound to Huh7 cells as effectively as did the WT pseudotype, the reduced infectivity of these pseudotypes was due to their ability to inhibit cell fusion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that specific residues, but not the structure, of this fusion peptide-like domain are required for mediating cell fusion and viral entry.",M1
19767579,"Mmp-20 and Klk4 cleavage site preferences for amelogenin sequences.Mmp-20 and Klk4 are the two key enamel proteases. Can both enzymes process amelogenin to generate the major cleavage products that accumulate during the secretory stage of amelogenesis? We isolated Mmp-20 and Klk4 from developing pig teeth and used them to digest the tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP), the leucine-rich amelogenin protein (LRAP), and 5 fluorescence peptides. We characterized the digestion products by LC-MSMS, SDS-PAGE, and C18 RP-HPLC monitored with fluorescence and UV detectors. Mmp-20 cleaves amelogenin sequences after Pro(162), Ser(148), His(62), <e>Ala</e>(63), and Trp(45). These cleavages generate all of the major cleavage products that accumulate in porcine secretory-stage enamel: the 23-kDa, 20-kDa, 13-kDa, 11-kDa, and 6-kDa (TRAP) amelogenins. Mmp-20 cleaves LRAP after Pro(45) and Pro(40), producing the two LRAP products previously identified in tooth extracts. Among these key cleavage sites, Klk4 was able to cleave only after His(62). We propose that Mmp-20 alone processes amelogenin during the secretory stage.",M1
19766907,"Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 associated with depression in Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Pro12Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has been associated with decreased obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and other age-associated diseases such as cognitive impairment, hypertension, cancer, osteoarthritis. Each one of these diseases had been linked to depression. Moreover, there is also an association between Pro12 <e>Ala</e> polymorphism in PPAR gamma2 and longevity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between Pro12 Ala polymorphism and depression in Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians. METHODS: The sample included 697 unrelated Chinese nonagenarians/centenarians (aged between 90-108 years, mean age: 93.5+/-3.35 years; 67.2% women). The Pro12Ala variant was examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Depression was measured with brief 23-item Geriatrics Depression Scale Chinese-edition (GDS-CD). RESULTS: In this sample, the genotype frequencies of the Pro12Ala polymorphism were 0% Ala12Ala, 9.2% Pro12Ala, 90.8% Pro12Pro and the prevalence of depression was 25.3%. Subjects who were 12Ala carriers had significantly lower prevalence of depression than those who were not 12Ala carriers (14.06 vs. 26.38%, p=0.034). Subjects without depression also had a higher frequency of 12Ala gene than those with depression (5.28 vs. 2.56%, p=0.031). Adjusting for certain clinical factors that may be associated with depression or with 12Ala carriers, multiple logistic regressions showed the 12Ala gene was associated with decreased incidence of depression. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that among Chinese nonagenarians and centenarians, the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 was associated with depression and that the 12Ala gene may be a factor for decreased depression.",M1
19756960,"Manganese superoxide dismutase: effect of the ala16val polymorphism on protein, activity, and mRNA levels in human breast cancer cell lines and stably transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts.The manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) ala16val polymorphism has been associated with various diseases including breast cancer. In the present study, we investigated levels of MnSOD protein, enzymatic activity, and mRNA with respect to MnSOD genotype in several human breast carcinoma cell lines and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), developed from the MnSOD knockout mouse, stably expressing human MnSOD-<e>ala</e> and MnSOD-val. In human breast cell lines, the MnSOD-ala allele was associated with increased levels of MnSOD protein and MnSOD protein per unit mRNA. In the MEF transformants, MnSOD activity correlated fairly well with MnSOD protein levels. MnSOD mRNA expression was significantly lower in MnSOD-ala versus MnSOD-val lines. MnSOD protein and activity levels were not related to MnSOD genotype in the transformed MEF, although, as observed in the human breast cell lines, the MEF human MnSOD-ala lines produced significantly more human MnSOD protein per unit mRNA than the human MnSOD-val lines. This suggests that there is more efficient production of MnSOD-ala protein compared to MnSOD-val protein. Examination of several indicators of reactive oxygen species levels, including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, in wild-type MEF and in MEF expressing similar elevated amounts of MnSOD-ala or val activity did not show differences related to the levels of MnSOD protein expression. In conclusion, in both human breast carcinoma cell lines and MEF cell lines stably transfected with human MnSOD, the MnSOD-ala allele was associated with increased production of MnSOD protein per unit mRNA indicating a possible imbalance in MnSOD protein production from the MnSOD-val mRNA.",M1
19748470,"A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for Marfey's derivatives of L-<e>Ala</e>, D-Ala, and D-Ala-D-Ala: application to the in vivo confirmation of alanine racemase as the target of cycloserine in Escherichia coli.Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is the target of several antibacterial agents and is also of interest as a target for future antibacterial agent development. Given the now widespread availability of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) instruments, the development of LC-MS/MS assays for cell wall biosynthesis intermediates would fill a needed gap in the analytical methodology available for antibacterial agent discovery and characterization. An LC-MS/MS assay for several early cell wall intermediates-L-Ala, D-Ala, and D-Ala-D-Ala-has been developed. This method relies on derivatization of bacterial extracts with Marfey's reagent. Marfey's reagent adducts of L-Ala and D-Ala were cleanly separated chromatographically, allowing Marfey's adducts of D-Ala and L-Ala to be separated prior to mass spectrometry (MS) detection and quantitation. The Marfey's adduct of D-Ala-D-Ala was also readily detectable using this same approach. This method shows good linearity (R(2)&gt;0.99), with a lower limit of quantitation of 1 pmol. This assay was demonstrated for characterization of the in vivo effect of cycloserine on Escherichia coli. Cycloserine resulted in a dramatic lowering of both D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Ala levels. Ampicillin had little effect on levels of these three metabolites, consistent with the actions of ampicillin on the later stages of cell wall biosynthesis. These observations indicate that cycloserine inhibits alanine racemase production of D-Ala in E. coli and demonstrates the utility of this assay in directly assessing D-Ala branch targeted antibacterial agents.",M1
19746945,"Conformation of the phosphate D-alanine zwitterion in bacterial teichoic acid from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.The conformation of d-alanine (d-<e>Ala</e>) groups of bacterial teichoic acid is a central, yet untested, paradigm of microbiology. The d-Ala binds via the C-terminus, thereby allowing the amine to exist as a free cationic NH(3)(+) group with the ability to form a contact ion pair with the nearby anionic phosphate group. This conformation hinders metal chelation by the phosphate because the zwitterion pair is charge neutral. To the contrary, the repulsion of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) is attributed to the presence of the d-Ala cation; thus the ion pair does not form in this model. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to measure the distance between amine and phosphate groups within cell wall fragments of Bacillus subtilis. The bacteria were grown on media containing (15)N d-Ala and beta-chloroalanine racemase inhibitor. The rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) pulse sequence was used to measure the internuclear dipolar coupling, and the results demonstrate (1) the metal-free amine-to-phosphate distance is 4.4 A and (2) the amine-to-phosphate distance increases to 5.4 A in the presence of Mg(2+) ions. As a result, the zwitterion exists in a nitrogen-oxygen ion pair configuration providing teichoic acid with a positive charge to repel CAMPs. Additionally, the amine of d-Ala does not prevent magnesium chelation in contradiction to the prevailing view of teichoic acids in metal binding. Thus, the NMR-based description of teichoic acid structure resolves the contradictory models, advances the basic understanding of cell wall biochemistry, and provides possible insight into the creation of new antibiotic therapies.",M1
19734890,"Oxidant-induced apoptosis is mediated by oxidation of the actin-regulatory protein cofilin.Physiological oxidants that are generated by activated phagocytes comprise the main source of oxidative stress during inflammation. Oxidants such as taurine chloramine (TnCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can damage proteins and induce apoptosis, but the role of specific protein oxidation in this process has not been defined. We found that the actin-binding protein cofilin is a key target of oxidation. When oxidation of this single regulatory protein is prevented, oxidant-induced apoptosis is inhibited. Oxidation of cofilin causes it to lose its affinity for actin and to translocate to the mitochondria, where it induces swelling and cytochrome c release by mediating opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). This occurs independently of Bax activation and requires both oxidation of cofilin Cys residues and dephosphorylation at Ser 3. Knockdown of endogenous cofilin using targeted siRNA inhibits oxidant-induced apoptosis, which is restored by re-expression of wild-type cofilin but not by cofilin containing Cys to <e>Ala</e> mutations. Exposure of cofilin to TnCl results in intramolecular disulphide bonding and oxidation of Met residues to Met sulphoxide, but only Cys oxidation causes cofilin to induce mitochondrial damage.",M1
19733160,"Gender-specific effect of Pro12Ala polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 gene on obesity risk and leptin levels in a Tunisian population.OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of the Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARgamma-2) gene on obesity or body mass index (BMI) and plasma leptin, insulin, adiponectin and lipid levels in a sample of the Tunisian population. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study included 387 obese patients and 288 control subjects. The Pro12Ala genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by a digestion with the restriction of endonuclease BstUI. RESULTS: In the whole population, there is no significant difference in genotype frequencies of the Pro12Ala polymorphism between obese patients and controls. However, separate analysis by gender revealed that obese men (but not women) had significantly higher frequency of Pro/<e>Ala</e> genotypes compared to controls (12.2% vs. 4.1%; chi(2)=6.76, p=0.009). In comparison to Pro/Pro homozygotes, Ala-allele bearers had a significantly higher risk of obesity [OR (95% CI)=3.26 (1.28-8.33)]. When obese subjects were stratified according to type 2 diabetes status, the association with obesity was only significant in obese non-diabetic patients [OR (95% CI)=3.74 (1.43-9.74), p=0.007]. Additionally, obese male patients carrying the Ala-allele had significantly higher body mass index (p=0.007) and plasma leptin levels (p=0.023) compared to those homozygous for Pro-allele. The significant effect of Pro12Ala polymorphism on plasma leptin levels disappeared after adjustment for age and BMI. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma-2 gene is associated with obesity in non-diabetic men from Tunisian origin.",M1
19720797,"Impact of the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism and ACE inhibitor therapy on new-onset microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes: evidence from BENEDICT.OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional studies found less microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with the Ala12 allele of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) Pro12Ala polymorphism. We prospectively evaluated the association between Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282) and new-onset microalbuminuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pro12Ala polymorphism was genotyped by TaqMan-based assay in genomic DNA of 1,119 consenting patients from BErgamo NEphrologic DIabetic Complications Trial (BENEDICT)-a prospective, randomized trial evaluating ACE inhibition effect on new-onset microalbuminuria (albuminuria 20-200 microg/min in at least two of three consecutive overnight urine collections in two consecutive visits) in hypertensive type 2 diabetes with albuminuria &lt;20 microg/min at inclusion. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of <e>Ala</e> (Ala/Ala or Ala/Pro) carriers and Pro/Pro homozygotes were similar, with a nonsignificant trend to lower albuminuria (P = 0.1107) in the 177 Ala carriers. Over a median (interquartile range) of 44.0 (17.1-51.9) months, 7 (4%) Ala carriers and 86 (9.1%) Pro/Pro homozygotes developed microalbuminuria (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45 [95% CI 0.21-0.97]; P = 0.042). Final albuminuria was significantly lower in Ala carriers than Pro/Pro homozygotes (7.3 +/- 9.1 vs. 10.5 +/- 24.9 microg/min, respectively), even after adjustment for baseline albuminuria (P = 0.048). Baseline and follow-up blood pressure and metabolic control were similar in both groups. Incidence of microalbuminuria was significantly decreased by ACE versus non-ACE inhibitor therapy in Pro/Pro homozygotes (6.3 vs. 11.9%, respectively, HR 0.46 [0.29-0.72]; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, the Ala allele protects from worsening albuminuria and new-onset microalbuminuria, and ACE inhibition blunts the excess risk of microalbuminuria associated with the Pro/Pro genotype. Evaluating Pro12Ala polymorphism may help identifying patients at risk who may benefit the most from early renoprotective therapy.",M1
19714641,"ADAM-8 isolated from human osteoarthritic chondrocytes cleaves fibronectin at <e>Ala</e>(271).OBJECTIVE: Fibronectin fragments are thought to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of cartilage degradation in arthritis. In a recent study, fibronectin neoepitopes resulting from cleavage of intact fibronectin at the Ala(271)/Val(272) scissile bond, generating an approximately 30-kd fragment with the new C-terminus VRAA(271) and an approximately 50-85-kd fragment with the new N-terminus (272)VYQP, were identified in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage. The present study was undertaken to isolate the enzymes responsible for this cleavage from human OA chondrocytes. METHODS: Fibronectin-degrading activity in human OA chondrocyte-conditioned medium (OACCM) was purified using conventional chromatography. A fluorescent peptide was developed based on the fibronectin scissile bond (269)RAA downward arrowVal(272), and this peptide was used to track fibronectinase activity during purification. Western blotting with antibodies that detect the fibronectin neoepitopes VRAA(271) and (272)VYQP was used to confirm cleavage of intact fibronectin by the enzymatically active fractions. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteins found in the fibronectinase-enriched fractions, with further confirmation by Western blotting. In addition, a recombinant enzyme identified by mass spectrometry was tested by Western blotting and dimethylmethylene blue assay for its ability to produce fibronectin neoepitopes in OA cartilage. RESULTS: Purification of OACCM by chromatography resulted in isolation of a fibronectin-degrading enzyme, and mass spectrometry identified ADAM-8 as the fibronectinase present in these preparations. Furthermore, treatment of OA cartilage with recombinant human ADAM-8 promoted cartilage catabolism. CONCLUSION: The results of this study identify ADAM-8 as a fibronectinase in human OA chondrocytes. Because ADAM-8 is capable of producing the fibronectin neoepitopes VRAA(271) and (272)VYQP in human OA cartilage, this enzyme may be an important mediator of cartilage catabolism.",M1
19694805,"Optimization of D-amino acid oxidase for low substrate concentrations--towards a cancer enzyme therapy.D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has recently become of interest as a biocatalyst for industrial applications and for therapeutic treatments. It has been used in gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies, in which its production of H2O2 in tumor cells can be regulated by administration of substrate. This approach is limited by the locally low O2 concentration and the high K(m) for this substrate. Using the directed evolution approach, one DAAO mutant was identified that has increased activity at low O2 and D-<e>Ala</e> concentrations and a 10-fold lower K(m) for O2. We report on the mechanism of this DAAO variant and on its cytotoxicity towards various mammalian cancer cell lines. The higher activity observed at low O2 and D-Ala concentrations results from a combination of modifications of specific kinetic steps, each being of small magnitude. These results highlight the potential in vivo applicability of this evolved mutant DAAO for tumor therapy.",M1
19663475,"Theoretical and experimental studies on alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides: design of a 14/12-helix from peptides with alternating (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] and L-<e>ala</e>.An (S)-C-linked carbo-epsilon-amino acid [(S)-epsilon-Caa((x))] was prepared from the known (S)-delta-Caa. This monomer was utilized together with l-Ala to give novel alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides in 1:1 alternation. Conformational analysis on penta- and hexapeptides by NMR (in CDCl(3)), CD, and MD studies led to the identification of robust 14/12-mixed helices. This is in agreement with the data from a theoretical conformational analysis on the basis of ab initio MO theory providing a complete overview on all formally possible hydrogen-bonded helix patterns of alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides with 1:1 backbone alternation. The  new motif  of a mixed 14/12-helix was predicted as most stable in vacuum. Obviously, the formation of ordered secondary structures is also possible in peptide foldamers with amino acid constituents of considerable backbone lengths. Thus, alpha/epsilon-hybrid peptides expand the domain of foldamers and allow the introduction of desired functionalities via the alpha-amino acid constituents.",M1
19657841,"A second case of Hb Fontainebleau [alpha21(B2)<e>Ala</e>--&gt;Pro] in an individual with microcytosis.The identification of a second case of Hb Fontainbleau [alpha21(B2)Ala--&gt;Pro] allowed us to re-examine its association with microcytosis, explore the effects of the mutation on protein stability and define the mutation at a DNA level. Although slightly unstable, the variant was expressed at 28-29% of the total and was caused by a heterozygous mutation in the alpha2 gene. There was no evidence for concomitant alpha-thalassemia (alpha-thal); both alpha-globin gene deletion analysis and sequencing of the alpha-globin locus failed to detect any additional mutations that might explain the relatively high expression level.",M1
19651526,"On the charge partitioning between c and z fragments formed after electron-capture induced dissociation of charge-tagged Lys-Lys and <e>Ala</e>-Lys dipeptide dications.Here we report on the charge partition between c and z fragments formed after femtosecond collisional electron-transfer from Cs atoms to charge-tagged peptide dications. Peptides chosen for study were Ala-Lys (AK) and Lys-Lys (KK) where one or both of the lysine epsilon-amino groups were trimethylated to provide one or two fixed charges. For peptides with only one charge tag, the other charge was obtained by protonation of an amino group. In some experiments the ammonium group was tagged by 18-crown-6-ether (CE). Since recombination energies decrease in the order: MeNH3+ &gt; NMe4+ &gt; MeNH3+(CE) &gt; NMe4+(CE), it is possible to change the probability for the transferred electron to end up at either the N-terminal or the C-terminal residue by CE attachment. We find, however, that the individual recombination energies have little influence on the relative ratio between the yield of c and z ions as long as there are no mobile protons that can be transferred between the two fragments. Our results can be accounted for by the Utah-Washington model where the electron is captured into an amide pi* orbital that weakens the N-C(alpha) bond and causes its breakage, followed by proton, electron, or hydrogen transfer between the c and z fragments that stay together as an ion-molecule complex for some time. The data are also in accordance with the notion that an amide group competes with the charged groups for the electron. Electron capture by charged groups results in loss of small neutrals such as hydrogen and ammonia.",M1
19651525,"Charge-separation reactions of doubly-protonated peptides: effect of peptide chain length.The collision induced dissociation of doubly-protonated (<e>Ala</e>)(x)His (x = 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) peptides have been studied. The major fragmentation reactions observed are symmetrical amide bond cleavages to give the complementary b(m) and y(N-m) ions, where N is the total number of residues in the peptide. Minor asymmetric cleavage to give doubly-protonated y ions also is observed, involving cleavage near the N-terminus. The shorter peptides (x = 5, 6, 7) show major cleavage of the second amide bond to yield b2 and y(N-2) ions, while (Ala)10His shows major symmetrical cleavage at the fourth and fifth amide bonds. (Ala)8His appears to be a transitional peptide in showing substantial symmetrical cleavage at the second, fourth, and fifth amide bonds. The results are in general agreement with the bifurcating nature of charge separation noted by Zubarev (J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom.2008, 19, 1755-1763) from a statistical analysis of a large body of doubly-protonated tryptic peptide CID mass spectra. It is shown that the b2 ion derived from doubly-protonated (Ala)5His has a protonated oxazolone structure.",M1
19643731,"Magnitude of a conformational change in the glycine receptor beta1-beta2 loop is correlated with agonist efficacy.The efficacy of agonists at Cys-loop ion channel receptors is determined by the rate they isomerize receptors to a pre-open flip state. Once the flip state is reached, the shut-open reaction is similar for low and high efficacy agonists. The present study sought to identify a conformational change associated with the closed-flip transition in the alpha1-glycine receptor. We employed voltage-clamp fluorometry to compare ligand-binding domain conformational changes induced by the following agonists, listed from highest to lowest affinity and efficacy: glycine &gt; beta-alanine &gt; taurine. Voltage-clamp fluorometry involves labeling introduced cysteines with environmentally sensitive fluorophores and inferring structural rearrangements from ligand-induced fluorescence changes. Agonist affinity and efficacy correlated inversely with maximum fluorescence magnitudes at labeled residues in ligand-binding domain loops D and E, suggesting that large conformational changes in this region preclude efficacious gating. However, agonist affinity and efficacy correlated directly with maximum fluorescence magnitudes from a label attached to A52C in loop 2, near the transmembrane domain interface. Because glycine experiences the largest affinity increase between closed and flip states, we propose that the magnitude of this fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the agonist affinity increase. In contrast, labeled residues in loops C, F, and the pre-M1 domain yielded agonist-independent fluorescence responses. Our results support the conclusion that a closed-flip conformation change, with a magnitude proportional to the agonist affinity increase from closed to flip states, occurs in the microenvironment of <e>Ala</e>-52.",M1
19624237,"Network of hydrogen bonds in Pro-<e>Ala</e>-Pro and Pro-Phe-Pro diamides: a first principles study of Ala--&gt;Phe point mutation in proline environment.Intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the Pro-Ala-Pro and Pro-Phe-Pro tripeptides has been characterized using Bader's atoms in molecule (AIM) analyses of relevant electron density topologies. The properties of hydrogen bonds with corresponding ring strains were investigated. Good correlations along the decrease in electron densities at ring critical points were examined from five- to ten-membered hydrogen-bound ring sizes; seven-membered rings being the most energetically favored. AIM analysis confirms the logical conclusion that the molecule has to become very compact to form as many hydrogen bonds as possible. The relatively large hydrogen bond stabilization attributed to the pronounced network of interactions comes at the  energetic expense  of a relatively large internal repulsion due to the compactness of the structures. The net balanced result was a very modest increase in the zero point corrected conformation energy (DeltaE(ZPEC)). These findings aid in establishing hydrogen bonding rules in reductionist  bottoms-up  approaches to peptide and protein folding.",M1
19620709,"Structural and molecular mechanism for autoprocessing of MARTX toxin of Vibrio cholerae at multiple sites.The multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin of Vibrio cholerae causes destruction of the actin cytoskeleton by covalent cross-linking of actin and inactivation of Rho GTPases. The effector domains responsible for these activities are here shown to be independent proteins released from the large toxin by autoproteolysis catalyzed by an embedded cysteine protease domain (CPD). The CPD is activated upon binding inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). In this study, we demonstrated that InsP(6) is not simply an allosteric cofactor, but rather binding of InsP(6) stabilized the CPD structure, facilitating formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The 1.95-A crystal structure of this InsP(6)-bound unprocessed form of CPD was determined and revealed the scissile bond Leu(3428)-<e>Ala</e>(3429) captured in the catalytic site. Upon processing at this site, CPD was converted to a form with 500-fold reduced affinity for InsP(6), but was reactivated for high affinity binding of InsP(6) by cooperative binding of both a new substrate and InsP(6). Reactivation of CPD allowed cleavage of the MARTX toxin at other sites, specifically at leucine residues between the effector domains. Processed CPD also cleaved other proteins in trans, including the leucine-rich protein YopM, demonstrating that it is a promiscuous leucine-specific protease.",M1
19618277,"Probing the urea dependence of residual structure in denatured human alpha-lactalbumin.Backbone (15)N relaxation parameters and (15)N-(1)H(N) residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have been measured for a variant of human alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) in 4, 6, 8 and 10 M urea. In the alpha-LA variant, the eight cysteine residues in the protein have been replaced by alanines (all-<e>Ala</e> alpha-LA). This protein is a partially folded molten globule at pH 2 and has been shown previously to unfold in a stepwise non-cooperative manner on the addition of urea. (15)N R(2) values in some regions of all-Ala alpha-LA show significant exchange broadening which is reduced as the urea concentration is increased. Experimental RDC data are compared with RDCs predicted from a statistical coil model and with bulkiness, average area buried upon folding and hydrophobicity profiles in order to identify regions of non-random structure. Residues in the regions corresponding to the B, D and C-terminal 3(10) helices in native alpha-LA show R(2) values and RDC data consistent with some non-random structural propensities even at high urea concentrations. Indeed, for residues 101-106 the residual structure persists in 10 M urea and the RDC data suggest that this might include the formation of a turn-like structure. The data presented here allow a detailed characterization of the non-cooperative unfolding of all-Ala alpha-LA at higher concentrations of denaturant and complement previous studies which focused on structural features of the molten globule which is populated at lower concentrations of denaturant.",M1
19586804,"Determination of D-serine and D-alanine in the tissues and physiological fluids of mice with various D-amino-acid oxidase activities using two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.Two-dimensional-HPLC procedures have been established for the sensitive and selective determination of D-serine (D-Ser) and D-alanine (D-<e>Ala</e>), and their amounts in the tissues and physiological fluids of mice with various D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) activities have been demonstrated. These two D-amino acids are modulators of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediated neurotransmission, and the alterations in their amounts following the changes in the DAO activity are matters of interest. After pre-column derivatization with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD-F), the D-amino acids were determined by the 2D-HPLC system with fluorescence detectors. As the first dimension, a microbore-monolithic-ODS column (750 mm x 0.53 mm I.D.) was adopted and a self-packed narrowbore-Pirkle type enantioselective column (Sumichiral OA-2500S, 250 mm x 1.5 mm I.D.) was selected for the second dimension. The lower limits of quantitation of D-Ser and D-Ala were 500 amol, and the within-day and day-to-day precisions were less than 6.8%. Using these methods, the amounts of D-Ser and D-Ala in 6 brain tissues, 4 peripheral tissues, serum and urine of mice having various DAO activities were determined; the amounts of these D-amino acids were drastically increased with a lowering of the DAO activity except for the cases of D-Ser in the frontal brain regions. The present micro-2D-HPLC procedures are powerful tools for the determination of small amounts of D-Ser and D-Ala in mammalian samples, and the obtained results would be useful for developing novel drugs that modulate the DAO activity, such as DAO inhibitors, against neuronal diseases.",M1
19581575,"Dynamics of locking of peptides onto growing amyloid fibrils.Sequence-dependent variations in the growth mechanism and stability of amyloid fibrils, which are implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, are poorly understood. We have carried out extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to monitor the structural changes that occur upon addition of random coil (RC) monomer fragments from the yeast prion Sup35 and Abeta-peptide onto a preformed fibril. Using the atomic resolution structures of the microcrystals as the starting points, we show that the RC --&gt; beta-strand transition for the Sup35 fragment occurs abruptly over a very narrow time interval, whereas the acquisition of strand content is less dramatic for the hydrophobic-rich Abeta-peptide. Expulsion of water, resulting in the formation of a dry interface between 2 adjacent sheets of the Sup35 fibril, occurs in 2 stages. Ejection of a small number of discrete water molecules in the second stage follows a rapid decrease in the number of water molecules in the first stage. Stability of the Sup35 fibril is increased by a network of hydrogen bonds involving both backbone and side chains, whereas the marginal stability of the Abeta-fibrils is largely due to the formation of weak dispersion interaction between the hydrophobic side chains. The importance of the network of hydrogen bonds is further illustrated by mutational studies, which show that substitution of the Asn and Gln residues to <e>Ala</e> compromises the Sup35 fibril stability. Despite the similarity in the architecture of the amyloid fibrils, the growth mechanism and stability of the fibrils depend dramatically on the sequence.",M1
19572624,"Unravelling the conformational dynamics of the aqueous alanine dipeptide with first-principle molecular dynamics.First principle DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations are performed in order to bring new insights into the conformational dynamics of the alanine dipeptide analogue Ac-<e>Ala</e>-NHMe (with methyl group caps at the extremities) immersed in liquid water at ambient temperature. Two simulations have been run for a total of 100 ps, which allows for a relevant statistical sampling of the phase space, at the ab initio level. PII-beta equilibrium and (PII-beta)-alphaR conformational interconversions are obtained, without a free-energy barrier for the Phi angle and with a rather low barrier of 2-3 kcal/mol for the Psi angle, easily overcome from solute-solvent energy transfers. We furthermore give first insights into the rather strong zwitterionic character of the peptide bonds of the dipeptide when immersed in the liquid. The structural and zwitterionic properties extracted from first-principle dynamics in the liquid phase will be useful as benchmarks for force field developments.",M1
19569641,"Intra- and intermolecular effects on 1H chemical shifts in a silk model Peptide determined by high-field solid state 1H NMR and empirical calculations.A combination of solid state 1H NMR chemical shift measurements and empirical chemical shift calculations has been used to interpret 1H solid state chemical shifts of a model peptide (<e>Ala</e>-Gly)15 for the crystalline domain of Bombyx mori silk fibroin in silk I and silk II structures, including a treatment of both intra- and intermolecular arrangements. Silk I and silk II are the structures of silk fibroin before and after spinning, respectively. Two peaks with equal intensity were observed for the amide protons of (AG)15 in silk I, whereas only one broad peak was observed for silk II, reflecting a difference of 1.1 ppm in Ala HN shift between silk I and silk II, but a difference of only 0.2 ppm in Gly HN shift. Chemical shift calculations predicted chemical shifts that are in good agreement with the experimental observations and showed that the origin of these chemical shift differences was predominantly the magnetic anisotropy effect from the C=O bond that hydrogen bonds with HN, which has a more favorable geometry for Ala HN in silk II than for the other HN. This result shows that we could distinguish between proton chemical shift effects arising from intermolecular interactions and those from intramolecular interactions by combining observation of the solid state 1H NMR chemical shift and empirical chemical shift calculation.",M1
19558269,"Polymorphism of Pro12Ala in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 gene in Iranian diabetic and obese subjects.BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) is a nuclear receptor that regulates adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the Pro12Ala single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the PPARgamma2 gene and type II diabetes (T2DM) and obesity in an Iranian population. METHODS: The genomic DNA of the 312 subjects included four groups: (1) nonobese with type II diabetes, (2) obese without type II diabetes, (3) obese with type II diabetes, and (4) nondiabetic nonobese controls. The Pro12Ala polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: Frequencies of the <e>Ala</e> allele in obese subjects were significantly different from those control subjects (odds ratio [OR], 2.358; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.101-5.05) (P = 0.025). In contrast, no significant association was detected between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and type II diabetes (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.261-1.628). In all subjects, the Ala carriers had a higher body mass index (BMI) compared with the common allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene is associated with obesity in Iranian subjects and the presence of the Ala allele could predict higher BMI.",M1
19555106,"Transport of free and peptide-bound pyrraline at intestinal and renal epithelial cells.Pyrraline is a quantitatively dominating glycation compound of the advanced Maillard reaction in foods and can be found in urine after consumption of pyrraline-containing food items. The purpose of this study was to investigate the transport of pyrraline and its dipeptide derivatives alanylpyrraline (<e>Ala</e>-Pyrr) and pyrralylalanine (Pyrr-Ala) at intestinal and renal cell lines. Pyrraline inhibited the l-[(3)H]lysine uptake with IC(50) values of 0.3 mM (Caco-2 cells) and 3.5 mM (OK cells), respectively, but not the uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar (Caco-2 and SKPT cells). In contrast, Ala-Pyrr strongly inhibited the uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar in Caco-2 and SKPT cells with IC(50) values of 0.19 and 0.017 mM, respectively. Pyrr-Ala inhibited the carrier-mediated uptake of [(14)C]Gly-Sar in Caco-2 and SKPT cells by 50% at concentrations of 0.03 and 0.008 mM, respectively. The transepithelial flux of peptide-bound pyrraline across Caco-2 cell monolayers was up to 15-fold higher compared to the flux of free pyrraline. We conclude that free pyrraline is not a substrate for the intestinal lysine transporter and that the absorption of dietary pyrraline occurs most likely in the form of dipeptides rather than as the free amino acid.",M1
19542229,"The elucidation of the structure of Thermotoga maritima peptidoglycan reveals two novel types of cross-link.Thermotoga maritima is a Gram-negative, hyperthermophilic bacterium whose peptidoglycan contains comparable amounts of L- and D-lysine. We have determined the fine structure of this cell-wall polymer. The muropeptides resulting from the digestion of peptidoglycan by mutanolysin were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis, dinitrophenylation, enzymatic determination of the configuration of the chiral amino acids, and mass spectrometry. The high-performance liquid chromatography profile contained four main peaks, two monomers, and two dimers, plus a few minor peaks corresponding to anhydro forms. The first monomer was the d-lysine-containing disaccharide-tripeptide in which the D-Glu-D-Lys bond had the unusual gamma--&gt;epsilon arrangement (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-<e>Ala</e>-gamma-D-Glu-epsilon-D-Lys). The second monomer was the conventional disaccharide-tetrapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala). The first dimer contained a disaccharide-L-Ala as the acyl donor cross-linked to the alpha-amine of D-Lys in a tripeptide acceptor stem with the sequence of the first monomer. In the second dimer, donor and acceptor stems with the sequences of the second and first monomers, respectively, were connected by a D-Ala4-alpha-D-Lys3 cross-link. The cross-linking index was 10 with an average chain length of 30 disaccharide units. The structure of the peptidoglycan of T. maritima revealed for the first time the key role of D-Lys in peptidoglycan synthesis, both as a surrogate of L-Lys or meso-diaminopimelic acid at the third position of peptide stems and in the formation of novel cross-links of the L-Ala1(alpha--&gt;alpha)D-Lys3 and D-Ala4(alpha--&gt;alpha)D-Lys3 types.",M1
19541927,"Amino acids in the rat intestinal lumen regulate their own absorption from a distant intestinal site.Intestinal nutrient transport is altered in response to changes in dietary conditions and luminal substrate level. It is not clear, however, whether an amino acid in the intestinal lumen can acutely affect its own absorption from a distant site. Our aim is to study the effect of an amino acid present in rat small intestinal segment on its own absorption from a proximal or distal site and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The effect of instillation of alanine (<e>Ala</e>) in either jejunum or ileum on its own absorption at ileal or jejunal level was examined in vivo. The modulation of this intestinal regulatory loop by the following interventions was studied: tetrodotoxin (TTX) added to Ala, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, chemical ablation of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent (CSPA) fibers, and IV administration of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist. In addition, the kinetics of jejunal Ala absorption and the importance of Na+-dependent transport were studied in vitro after instilling Ala in the ileum. Basal jejunal Ala absorption [0.198 +/- 0.018 micromol x cm(-1) x 20 min(-1) (means +/- SD)] was significantly decreased with the instillation of 20 mM Ala in the ileum or in an adjacent distal jejunal segment (0.12 +/- 0.015; P &lt; 0.0001 and 0.138 +/- 0.014; P &lt; 0.002, respectively). Comparable inhibition was observed in the presence of proline in the ileum. Moreover, basal Ala absorption from the ileum (0.169 +/- 0.025) was significantly decreased by the presence of 20 mM Ala in the jejunum (0.103 +/- 0.027; P &lt; 0.01). The inhibitory effect on jejunal Ala absorption was abolished by TTX, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, neonatal capsaicin treatment, and CGRP antagonism. In vitro studies showed that Ala in the ileum affects Na+-mediated transport and increases K(m) without affecting Vmax. Intraluminal amino acids control their own absorption from a distant part of the intestine, by affecting the affinity of the Na+-mediated Ala transporter, through a neuronal mechanism that involves CSPA and CGRP.",M1

19531490,"Phosphorylation-dependent autoinhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase accounts for Ca2+ sensitization force of smooth muscle contraction.The reversible regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) in response to agonist stimulation and cAMP/cGMP signals plays an important role in the regulation of smooth muscle (SM) tone. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the inhibition of MLCP induced by the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1), a regulatory subunit of MLCP, at Thr-696 and Thr-853 using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MYPT1 fragments having the inhibitory phosphorylation sites. GST-MYPT1 fragments, including only Thr-696 and only Thr-853, inhibited purified MLCP (IC(50) = 1.6 and 60 nm, respectively) when they were phosphorylated with RhoA-dependent kinase (ROCK). The activities of isolated catalytic subunits of type 1 and type 2A phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) were insensitive to either fragment. Phospho-GST-MYPT1 fragments docked directly at the active site of MLCP, and this was blocked by a PP1/PP2A inhibitor microcystin (MC)-LR or by mutation of the active sites in PP1. GST-MYPT1 fragments induced a contraction of beta-escin-permeabilized ileum SM at constant pCa 6.3 (EC(50) = 2 microm), which was eliminated by <e>Ala</e> substitution of the fragment at Thr-696 or by ROCK inhibitors or 8Br-cGMP. GST-MYPT1-(697-880) was 5-times less potent than fragments including Thr-696. Relaxation induced by 8Br-cGMP was not affected by Ala substitution at Ser-695, a known phosphorylation site for protein kinase A/G. Thus, GST-MYPT1 fragments are phosphorylated by ROCK in permeabilized SM and mimic agonist-induced inhibition and cGMP-induced activation of MLCP. We propose a model in which MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 and Thr-853 causes an autoinhibition of MLCP that accounts for Ca(2+) sensitization of smooth muscle force.",M1
19501421,"Enterocin C, a class IIb bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis C901, a strain isolated from human colostrum.Enterocin C (EntC), a class IIb bacteriocin was purified from culture supernatants of Enterococcus faecalis C901, a strain isolated from human colostrum. Enterocin C consists of two distinct peptides, named EntC1 and EntC2, whose complementary action is required for full antimicrobial activity. The structural genes entC1 and entC2 encoding enterocins EntC1 and EntC2, respectively, and that encoding the putative immunity protein (EntCI) are located in the 9-kb plasmid pEntC, harboured by E. faecalis C901. The N-terminal sequence of both antimicrobial peptides revealed that EntC1 (4284 Da) is identical to Ent1071A, one of the two peptides that form enterocin 1071 (Ent1071), a bacteriocin produced by E. faecalis BFE 1071. In contrast, EntC2 (3867 Da) presents the non-polar alanine residue at position 17 (<e>Ala</e>(17)) instead of the polar threonine residue (Thr(17)) in Ent1071B, the second peptide constituting Ent1071. In spite of peptide similarities, EntC differs from Ent1071 in major aspects, including the complementary activity among its constitutive peptides and its wider inhibitory spectrum of activity. Different amphiphilic alpha-helical conformations between EntC2 and Ent1071B could explain both, acquired complementary activity and increased antimicrobial spectrum.",M1
19483081,"<e>Ala</e> scanning of the inhibitory region of cardiac troponin I.In skeletal and cardiac muscles, troponin (Tn), which resides on the thin filament, senses a change in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Tn is composed of TnC, TnI, and TnT. Ca(2+) binding to the regulatory domain of TnC removes the inhibitory effect by TnI on the contraction. The inhibitory region of cardiac TnI spans from residue 138 to 149. Upon Ca(2+) activation, the inhibitory region is believed to be released from actin, thus triggering actin-activation of myosin ATPase. In this study, we created a series of Ala-substitution mutants of cTnI to delineate the functional contribution of each amino acid in the inhibitory region to myofilament regulation. We found that most of the point mutations in the inhibitory region reduced the ATPase activity in the presence of Ca(2+), which suggests the same region also acts as an activator of the ATPase. The thin filaments can also be activated by strong myosin head (S1)-actin interactions. The binding of N-ethylmaleimide-treated myosin subfragment 1 (NEM-S1) to actin filaments mimics such strong interactions. Interestingly, in the absence of Ca(2+) NEM-S1-induced activation of S1 ATPase was significantly less with the thin filaments containing TnI(T144A) than that with the wild-type TnI. However, in the presence of Ca(2+), there was little difference in the activation of ATPase activity between these preparations.",M1
19479323,"Empirical estimation of the energetic contribution of individual interface residues in structures of protein-protein complexes.We report a simple algorithm to scan interfaces in protein-protein complexes for identifying binding 'hot spots'. The change in side-chain solvent accessible area (DeltaASA) of interface residues has been related to change in binding energy due to mutating interface residues to <e>Ala</e> (DeltaDeltaG (X --&gt; ALA)) based on two criteria-hydrogen bonding across the interface and location in the interface core-both of which are major determinants in specific, high-affinity binding. These relationships are used to predict the energetic contribution of individual interface residues. The predictions are tested against 462 experimental X --&gt; ALA mutations from 28 interfaces with an average unsigned error of 1.04 kcal/mol. More than 80% of interface hot spots (with experimental DeltaDeltaG &gt; or = 2 kcal/mol) could be identified as being energetically important. From the experimental values, Asp, Lys, Tyr and Trp are found to contribute most of the binding energy, burying &gt;45 A2 on average. The method described here would be useful to understand and interfere with protein interactions by assessing the energetic importance of individual interface residues.",M1
19475463,"Ala54Thr polymorphism of fatty acid binding protein 2, role on insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in presurgical morbid obesity patients.BACKGROUND: A transition G to A at codon 54 of fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) results in an amino acid substitution (<e>ala</e> 54 to Thr 54). This polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance in some populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Thr54 polymorphism in the FABP2 gene on obesity anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, and adipocytokines in patients with presurgical morbid obesity. DESIGN: A population of 55 morbid obese patients was enrolled. An indirect calorimetry, tetrapolar electrical bioimpedance, blood pressure, a serial assessment of nutritional intake with 3 days of written food records, and biochemical analysis (lipid profile, adipocytokines, insulin, C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein-a) were performed. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined Ala54/Thr54 and Thr54/Thr54 as a mutant-type group and wild-type group (Ala54/Ala54). RESULTS: Twenty nine (52.7%) had the genotype Ala54/Ala54 (wild-type group) and 26 (47.3%) patients had the genotype Ala54/Thr54 (24 patients, 43.7%) or Thr54/Thr54 (two patients, 3.6%; mutant-type group). Insulin (22.4 +/- 16.8 vs. 26.1 +/- 17.1 mg/dl; p = 0.04) and homeostasis model assessment (6.1 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.7 +/- 4.5; p = 0.04) levels were higher in mutant-type group than wild-type group. In mutant-type group, leptin levels (134.8 +/- 83 vs. 206.5 +/- 76 ng/ml; p = 0.03) were higher than wild-type group. Moreover, adiponectin levels (80.9 +/- 39.6 vs. 23.9 +/- 13.8 ng/ml; p = 0.02) were higher in wild-type group than mutant-type group. CONCLUSION: The novel finding of this study is the association of Thr54 allele with insulin resistance, leptin, and adiponectin levels in morbidly obese patients.",M1
19467627,"The pH dependence of the allosteric response of human liver pyruvate kinase to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ATP, and alanine.The allosteric regulation of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP; activator), ATP (inhibitor) and alanine (<e>Ala</e>; inhibitor) was monitored over a pH range from 6.5 to 8.0 at 37 degrees C. As a function of increasing pH, hL-PYK's affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and for Fru-1,6-BP decreases, while affinities for ATP and alanine slightly increases. At pH 6.5, Fru-1,6-BP and ATP elicit only small allosteric impacts on PEP affinity. As pH increases, Fru-1,6-BP and ATP elicit greater allosteric responses, but the response to alanine is relatively constant. Since the magnitudes of the allosteric coupling for ATP and for alanine inhibition are different and the pH dependences of these magnitudes are not similar, these inhibitors likely elicit their responses using different molecular mechanisms. In addition, our results fail to support a general correlation between pH dependent changes in effector affinity and pH dependent changes in the corresponding allosteric response.",M1
19456859,"Alanine screening of the intracellular loops of the human bradykinin B receptor--effects on receptor maintenance, G protein activation and internalization.The bradykinin B(2) receptor is coupled to G protein G(q/11) and becomes sequestered into intracellular compartments after activation. To more closely define the receptor sequences involved in these processes and their functions, we systematically mutated all three intracellular loops (ICLs), either as point mutations or in groups of three to five amino acids to <e>Ala</e>, obtaining a total of 14 mutants. All constructs were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and, with the exception of triple mutant DRY --&gt; AAA, retained the ability to specifically bind [(3)H]bradykinin. The binding affinities at 4 or 37 degrees C of several mutants differed considerably from those determined for the wild-type receptor, indicating an allosteric connection between the conformation of the binding site and that of the ICLs. Mutations in ICL-1 strongly reduced surface expression without affecting G protein signaling or [(3)H]bradykinin internalization. Two cluster mutants in the middle of ICL-2 containing basic residues displayed considerably reduced potencies, whereas two mutations in ICL-3 resulted in receptor conformations that were considered to be semi-active, based on the observation that they responded with phosphoinositide hydrolysis to compounds normally considered to be antagonists. This, and the fact that a cluster mutant at the C-terminal end of ICL-3 was signaling incompetent, hint at the involvement of ICL-2 and ICL-3 in G(q/11) activation, albeit with different functions. None of the mutants displayed reduced ligand-induced receptor internalization, indicating that the loops are not essential for this process. No conclusion could be drawn, however, with regard to the role of the DRY sequence, as the corresponding triplet mutation lacked binding capability.",M1
19440631,"Free energies and forces in helix-coil transition of homopolypeptides under stretching.We show here that constant velocity steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of alpha-helices in a vacuum present a well defined plateau in the force-extension relationship for homopolypeptides having more than (approximately) twenty residues. With the processes being far away from equilibrium, the energies strongly depend on the stretching velocity. Importantly, for a given velocity variation, the energy variation depends also on the helix sequence. Additionally, our observations show that homopolypeptides made of ten different amino acids (<e>Ala</e>, Cys, Gln, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr and Val) present a linear helix-coil transition.",M1
19429716,"Functional importance of a structurally distinct homodimeric complex of the family B G protein-coupled secretin receptor.Oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors has been described, but its structural basis and functional importance have been inconsistent. Here, we demonstrate that the agonist occupied wild-type secretin receptor is predominantly in a guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity state and exhibits negative cooperativity, whereas the monomeric receptor is primarily in a guanine nucleotide-insensitive lower affinity state. We previously demonstrated constitutive homodimerization of this receptor through the lipid-exposed face of transmembrane (TM) IV. We now use cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of 14 TM IV residues, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and functional analysis to map spatial approximations and functional importance of specific residues in this complex. All, except for three helix-facing mutants, trafficked to the cell surface, where secretin was shown to bind and elicit cAMP production. Cells expressing complementary-tagged receptors were treated with cuprous phenanthroline to establish disulfide bonds between spatially approximated cysteines. BRET was measured as an indication of receptor oligomerization and was repeated after competitive disruption of oligomers with TM IV peptide to distinguish covalent from noncovalent associations. Although all constructs generated a significant BRET signal, this was disrupted by peptide in all except for single-site mutants replacing five residues with cysteine. Of these, covalent stabilization of receptor homodimers through positions of Gly(243), Ile(247), and <e>Ala</e>(250) resulted in a GTP-sensitive high-affinity state of the receptor, whereas the same procedure with Ala(246) and Phe(240) mutants resulted in a GTP-insensitive lower affinity state. We propose the existence of a functionally important, structurally specific high-affinity dimeric state of the secretin receptor, which may be typical of family B G protein-coupled receptors.",M1
19423917,"Cu(II)-catalyzed reactions in ternary [Cu(AA)(AA - H)]+ complexes (AA = Gly, <e>Ala</e>, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu, Phe).The unimolecular chemistry of [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes, composed of an intact and a deprotonated amino acid (AA) ligand, have been probed in the gas phase by tandem and multistage mass spectrometry in an electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The amino acids examined include Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu and Phe. Upon collisionally-activated dissociation (CAD), the [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes undergo decarboxylation with simultaneous reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I); during this process, a radical site is created at the alpha-carbon of the decarboxylated ligand (H(2)N(1) - (*)C(alpha)H - C(beta)H(2) - R; R = side chain substituent). The radical site is able to move along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid to form two new radicals (HN(1)(*) - C(alpha)H(2) - C(beta)H(2) - R and H(2)N(1) - C(alpha)H(2) - (*)C(beta)H - R). From the complexes of Gly and t-Leu, only C(alpha) and N(1) radicals can be formed. The whole radical ligand can be lost to form [Cu(I)AA](+) from these three isomeric radicals. Alternatively, further radical induced dissociations can take place along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand to yield [Cu(II)AA(AA - 2H - CO(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA((*)NH(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA(HN = C(alpha)H(2))](+), or [Cu(I)AA(H(2)N - C(alpha)H = C(beta)H - R'](+) (R' = partial side chain substituent). The sodiated copper complexes, [Cu(II)(AA - H + Na)(AA - H)](+), show the same fragmentation patterns as their non-sodiated counterparts; sodium ion is retained on the intact amino acid ligand and is not involved in the CAD pathways. The amino groups of both AA units, the carbonyl group of the intact amino acid, and the deprotonated hydroxyl oxygen coordinate Cu(II) in square-planar fashion. Ab initio calculations indicate that the metal ion facilitates hydrogen atom shuttling between the N(1), C(alpha) and C(beta) atoms of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand. The dissociations of the decarboxylated radical ions unveil important insight about the so far largely unknown intrinsic chemistry of alpha-amino acid and peptide radicals, which are implicated as intermediates in numerous pathogenic biological processes.",M1
19393216,"Elucidation of the disulfide bridge pattern of the recombinant human growth and differentiation factor 5 dimer and the interchain Cys/<e>Ala</e> mutant monomer.Growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) is involved in many developmental processes such as chondrogenesis and joint and bone formation. A recombinant monomeric human GDF5 mutant rGDF5(C84A) is in vitro as potent as the dimeric native form, and clinical investigations of rGDF5(C84A) are in progress. Native homodimeric GDF5 belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily; each monomer contains a cystine knot formed by three intrachain disulfide bridges, and the monomers are connected via an interchain disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge pattern of recombinant homodimeric rGDF5 was recently elucidated by X-ray diffraction. A combination of proteolytic degradation with thermolysin, separation of the generated fragments by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and subsequent analyses of the disulfide-linked peptides by electrospray-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and Edman degradation led to the unambiguous identification of the disulfide bridge pattern of the monomeric mutant rGDF5(C84A) and of the homodimeric rGDF5 in solution. The cystine knot of homodimeric rGDF5 exhibits the pattern Cys1-Cys5, Cys2-Cys6, and Cys3-Cys7 (three intrachain disulfide bonds), and the monomers are connected by a single interchain disulfide bridge (Cys4-Cys4) in accordance with other members of the TGF-beta superfamily. The monomeric mutant rGDF5(C84A) exhibits the same cystine knot pattern as homodimeric rGDF5.",M1
19380484,"The active form of human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) repressor lacks exon 8, and its Pro 185 and <e>Ala</e> 185 variants repress both AHR and hypoxia-inducible factor.The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) repressor (AHRR) inhibits AHR-mediated transcription and has been associated with reproductive dysfunction and tumorigenesis in humans. Previous studies have characterized the repressor function of AHRRs from mice and fish, but the human AHRR ortholog (AHRR(715)) appeared to be nonfunctional in vitro. Here, we report a novel human AHRR cDNA (AHRRDelta8) that lacks exon 8 of AHRR(715). AHRRDelta8 was the predominant AHRR form expressed in human tissues and cell lines. AHRRDelta8 effectively repressed AHR-dependent transactivation, whereas AHRR(715) was much less active. Similarly, AHRRDelta8, but not AHRR(715), formed a complex with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT). Repression of AHR by AHRRDelta8 was not relieved by overexpression of ARNT or AHR coactivators, suggesting that competition for these cofactors is not the mechanism of repression. AHRRDelta8 interacted weakly with AHR but did not inhibit its nuclear translocation. In a survey of transcription factor specificity, AHRRDelta8 did not repress the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor or estrogen receptor alpha but did repress hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent signaling. AHRRDelta8-Pro(185) and -Ala(185) variants, which have been linked to human reproductive disorders, both were capable of repressing AHR or HIF. Together, these results identify AHRRDelta8 as the active form of human AHRR and reveal novel aspects of its function and specificity as a repressor.",M1
19374358,"Amide I bands of terminally blocked alanine in solutions investigated by infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation: hydrogen-bonding interactions and solvent effects.Structural aspects of terminally blocked alanine trans-N-acetyl-L-alanyl-trans-N'-methylamide (Ac-<e>Ala</e>-NHMe) in several different solvents were compared by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The amide I bands between 1600 and 1700 cm(-1) appeared to change depending on media, indicating dissimilar hydrogen-bonding interactions among the peptides and solvent molecules. The minimum energy geometry in the isolated gas phase and aqueous environments were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G** theoretical level. In the solid state, Ac-Ala-NHMe is assumed to have an extended beta-stranded structure (C5), whereas it is assumed to have a cyclic structure (C7eq or alphaL) in a nonpolar tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. The optimized backbone dihedral angles (Phi, Psi) of Ac-Ala-NHMe plus four explicit water molecules were estimated to be -94 degrees and +133 degrees, respectively, indicating the polyproline II structure (PII). The energy differences between the most stable conformers were predicted to be larger for Ac-Ala-NHMe, which implies that more conformational ensemble structures should coexist for the gas phase than for the aqueous medium with explicit water molecules.",M1
19362200,"Enantioselective recognition of alanine in solution with modified gold electrodes using chiral PAMAM dendrimers G4.0.Enantiomeric alanine was covalently grafted onto modified gold electrodes with mercaptopropionic acid and PAMAM dendrimers G4.0 with amine terminal groups. Cyclic voltammetric experiments in the presence of monocarboxylic ferrocene as a probe molecule proved that the alanine (<e>Ala</e>) was immobilized as a monolayer on the gold electrodes. Electron transfer to Ru(NH3)6Cl3 in solutions of different pH was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Changes in solution pH resulted in the variation of the charge state of the terminal group and surface pKa values were estimated on the basis of these results. Because of electrostatic interactions between the positive charged groups on the electrode surface and the Ala, enantioselective recognition was possible. The interaction between enantiomers can be proven with molecular simulation. The electro-oxidation peak current was linearly dependent on Ala concentration over the range 0-10 microM with slopes between 143 and 187 microAcm(-2)/microM. The detection limit (3sigma) was 0.4059 microM for PAMAM G4.0-D(+)Ala-L(-)Ala and 0.4172 microM for PAMAM G4.0-L(-)Ala-D(+)Ala.",M1
19331431,"Qualitative analysis of collective mode frequency shifts in L-alanine using terahertz spectroscopy.We have observed collective mode frequency shifts in deuterium-substituted L-alanine, three of which have previously only been calculated. Terahertz (THz) absorbance spectra were acquired at room temperature in the spectral range of 66-90 cm(-1), or 2.0-2.7 THz, for L-alanine (L-<e>Ala</e>) and four L-Ala compounds in which hydrogen atoms (atomic mass = 1 amu) were substituted with deuterium atoms (atomic mass = 2 amu): L-Ala-2-d, L-Ala-3,3,3-d(3), L-Ala-2,3,3,3-d(4), and L-Ala-d(7). The absorbance maxima of two L-Ala collective modes in this spectral range were recorded for multiple spectral measurements of each compound, and the magnitude of each collective mode frequency shift due to increased mass of these specific atoms was evaluated for statistical significance. Calculations were performed which predict the THz absorbance frequencies based on the estimated reduced mass of the modes. The shifts in absorbance maxima were correlated with the location(s) of the substituted deuterium atom(s) in the L-alanine molecule, and the atoms contributing to the absorbing delocalized mode in the crystal structure were deduced using statistics described herein. The statistical analyses presented also indicate that the precision of the method allows reproducible frequency shifts as small as 1 cm(-1) or 0.03 THz to be observed and that these shifts are not random error in the measurement.",M1

Decreased susceptibility to lysostaphin suggests alterations to the wall teichoic acid (WTA) content of ECg-grown bacteria. Changes in WTA structure in response to ECg were determined. METHODS: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of purified monomers from S. aureus was used to elucidate WTA structures. Molecular modelling of WTA chains was employed to determine their spatial configuration. RESULTS: ECg-grown methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains BB568 and EMRSA-16 displayed markedly reduced resistance to oxacillin, had thickened cell walls and separated poorly. Growth in ECg-supplemented medium reduced the substitution of the WTA backbone by d-alanine (d-<e>Ala</e>); ratios of N-acetyl glucosamine to d-Ala were reduced from 0.6 and 0.49 (for BB568 and EMRSA-16) to 0.3 and 0.28, respectively. Molecular simulations indicated a decrease in the positive charge of the bacterial wall, confirmed by increased binding of cationized ferritin, and an increase in WTA chain flexibility to a random coil conformation. CONCLUSIONS: Structural elucidation and molecular modelling of WTA indicated that conformational changes associated with reduced d-Ala substitution may contribute to the increased susceptibility of MRSA to beta-lactam antibiotics and account for other elements of the ECg-induced phenotype.",M1
19305404,"Bases in the anticodon loop of tRNA(<e>Ala</e>)(GGC) prevent misreading.The bases at positions 32 and 38 in the tRNA anticodon loop are known to have a specific conservation depending upon the anticodon triplets. Here we report that evolutionarily conserved pairs of bases at positions 32 and 38 in tRNA(Ala)(GGC) prevent misreading of a near-cognate valine codon, GUC. The tRNA(Ala)(GGC) molecules with the conserved A32-U38 and C32-G38 pairs do not read GUC, whereas those with three representative nonconserved pairs, U32-U38, U32-A38 and C32-A38, direct the misincorporation of alanine at this valine codon into the peptide chain. Overexpression of the nonconserved tRNA(Ala)(GGC) in Escherichia coli is toxic and prevents cell growth. These results suggested that the bases at positions 32 and 38 in tRNA(Ala)(GGC) evolved to preserve the fidelity of the cognate codon reading.",M1

Pre-steady state kinetic measurements on E. coli ribosomes show that, unlike the wild-type tRNA(Ala)(GGC), the misreading mutant tRNA(Ala)(GGC) shows rapid GTP hydrolysis and no detectable proofreading on near-cognate codons. Similarly, tRNA(Ala)(GGC) mutated to contain C32-G38, a pair that is found in some bacterial tRNA(Ala)(GGC) sequences, was able to decode only the cognate codons, whereas tRNA(Ala)(GGC) containing a more common C32-A38 pair was able to decode all cognate and near-cognate codons tested. We propose that many of the phylogenetically conserved sequence elements present in each tRNA have evolved to suppress translation of near-cognate codons.",M1
19295036,"[Scaffolds based on collagen and chitosan for post-burn tissue engineering]Porous scaffolds based on collagen and chitosan have been obtained from mixed bio-polymeric solutions and mixture freeze-drying method in the purpose of using them as materials for post-burns tissue regeneration. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Soluble collagen from bovine leather was obtained by acid-base extraction (isoelectric pH = 4.82). Two types of chitosan (CS I, M(w) = 755.900, de-acetylating degree of 79.2% and CS II, M(w) = 309.900, de-acetylating degree of 79.7%), were provided by Vascon Co., Canada. Various compositions were prepared and then structurally and morphologically characterized. In vitro degradation studies were performed in buffered collagenase or chitosan solutions, respectively, and the kinetic data were analysed. Materials effect on the tissue regeneration was tested on heat-induced burns in Wistar rats by covering the damaged tissue with collagen-chitosan scaffolds for a period of 28 days. Materials were changed every 7 days. At the end of the follow-up period skin tissue samples were harvested for histological investigation. RESULTS: By freeze-drying of collagen-chitosan solutions porous scaffolds were obtained with a lamellar morphology and porosity closer to chitosan than to collagen. In vitro degradation tests in simulated body fluid with collagenase revealed a decrease of the degradation rate of the collagen by mixing with chitosan. By using chitosan with lower molecular weight the degradation rate of the materials was decreased too, and the influence of the proportion of chitosan in composition diminished; stronger interactions between polymers hinder the enzyme diffusion to the following amino-acids groups: glycine - leucine (Gly-Leu), glycine - isoleucine (Gly-Ile), alanine-proline-glycine/leucine (-<e>Ala</e>-Pro-Gly-/-Leu-). In vivo tests and histological examination revealed a differentiated repair process of the post-combustion wounds in accordance with the scaffold-type influence.

19275891,"CASK point mutation regulates protein-protein interactions and NR2b promoter activity.Mutations in the CASK gene result in mental retardation and microcephaly in humans, suggesting an important role for CASK in brain. CASK gene knockout in mice causes neonatal lethality, making further elucidation in mouse models difficult. Because CASK was originally identified as a multidomain adaptor protein, identifying a point mutation interrupting a specific protein interaction would be useful in dissecting its molecular function. Here, a Thr-to-<e>Ala</e> mutation in the rat CASK guanylate kinase (GK) domain was shown to reduce interactions among CASK and Tbr-1 and CINAP, two critical brain proteins. The effect is specific: this mutation does not affect CASK dimerization that occurs via the GK domain. The Tbr-1-CASK-CINAP complex regulates expression of the NMDA receptor subunit 2b (NR2b), and we show that this point mutation also affects NR2b promoter activity. The identification of this mutation may make it possible to further dissect the function of CASK in brain.",M1

The chirality can be further memorized and enforced through strong electrostatic interactions between TPPS aggregates and achiral poly(allylamine) [PAA].Supramolecular chirality in two configurational homoaggregates of anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) can be induced by D- and L-alanine (<e>Ala</e>) in acidic water, respectively. The induced supramolecular chirality can be further memorized and enforced, even after complete removal of Ala or in the presence of excess Ala with the opposite configuration, through strong electrostatic interactions with achiral poly(allylamine) [PAA]. The ionic chiral interactions between TPPS and Ala or PAA are characterized by means of UV/Vis absorption and circular dichroism spectrometry. Fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy are used as complementary techniques. On the basis of the comprehensive experimental results, a possible mechanism for chiral induction, memory, and amplification of TPPS homoaggregates by chiral amino acids and achiral PAA is proposed. Thus, we demonstrate a novel strategy to realize chiral memory in supramolecular systems by polyelectrolytes through hierarchical electrostatic self-assembly.",M1
19252313,"Contribution of each amino acid residue in polymyxin B(3) to antimicrobial and lipopolysaccharide binding activity.This study on the structure-activity relationship of polymyxin B, a cyclic peptide antibiotic, used sixteen synthetic polymyxin B(3) analogs including alanine scanning analogs to elucidate the contribution of the side chains to antimicrobial activity and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding. Of these analogs, [<e>Ala</e>(5)]-polymyxin B(3) showed greatly reduced antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) with MIC values of 4-16 nmol/ml, suggesting that the Dab (alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid) residue at position 5 is the most important residue contributing to bactericidal activity. The antibacterial contribution of Dab when located within the lactam ring (positions 5, 8 and 9) was greater than when located outside the ring (positions 1 and 3). [D-Ala(6)]-, [L-Phe(6)]-, [Ala(7)]-, and [Gly(7)]-polymyxin B(3) analogs retained potent antimicrobial activity, indicating that neither the reduction of hydrophobic character of the D-Phe(6)-Leu(7) region nor the D-configuration at position 6 is indispensable for antimicrobial activity. LPS binding studies showed that decreased hydrophobicity of the lactam ring had little effect, but the N(gamma)-amino function of the Dab residues at position 1, 3, 5, 8 and 9 greatly affected LPS binding, with the contribution of Dab(5) being the most significant.",M1

19228871,"PPAR gamma variant influences angiographic outcome and 10-year cardiovascular risk in male symptomatic coronary artery disease patients.OBJECTIVE: Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma signaling influences metabolic profiles and the propensity toward inflammation. Small-molecule stimulation of PPARgamma is investigated for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The common PPARgamma Pro12Ala variant has functional and prognostic consequences. A protective effect of the 12Ala-allele carriership on diabetes and myocardial infarction in healthy populations has been suggested. The relevance of this pathway also needs exploration in patients with manifest vascular disease. We investigated the effects of carriership of the Pro12Ala variant on angiographic and cardiovascular event outcomes in male patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) cohort was genotyped for the Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282). Ten-year follow-up was derived from nation-wide registries, and risks were estimated using proportional hazards. Quantitative coronary angiography measurements were obtained and relations with genotype estimated using a generalized linear model. RESULTS: Genotypes ascertained (n = 679) comprised 540 (80%) Pro/Pro, 126 (19%) Pro/<e>Ala</e>, and 13 (2%) Ala/Ala subjects. The 12Ala allele was associated with less extensive focal (P = 0.001) and diffuse (P = 0.002) atherosclerosis and lower 10-year cardiovascular risk. Hazard ratios were 0.10 (95% CI 0.01-0.70, P = 0.02) for ischemic heart disease and 0.24 (0.08-0.74, P = 0.013) for vascular death, per each added copy of 12Ala, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of the 12Ala allele of PPARgamma have less widespread CAD and are considerably protected against 10-year (cardio)vascular morbidity and mortality. These long-term findings in patients with manifest CAD support an important role of PPARgamma in determining vascular risk.",M1
19203467,"Neurochemical effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine on brain GABA and alanine: A comparison with vigabatrin.PURPOSE: To compare phenelzine (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (<e>ALA</e>), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (ALA-T). METHODS: Male rats were administered PLZ (10 mg/kg) or VIG (1,000 mg/kg) i.p., and the rats were euthanized 4 hours later and the brains removed for analysis of levels of GABA and ALA (by electron capture gas chromatography after derivatization) and activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA-T (radiochemical assays). RESULTS: Both PLZ and VIG inhibited GABA-T and elevated GABA levels. Only PLZ inhibited MAO and ALA-T and elevated ALA levels. The effects of PLZ on both amino acids and their transaminases were blocked by pre-treatment with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine. This pretreament had no effect on the inhibition of GABA-T or the elevation of brain GABA levels produced by VIG. CONCLUSIONS: At the doses studied, PLZ was as effective as VIG at elevating brain GABA levels, but, unlike VIG, also inhibited MAO and ALA-T (and increased brain ALA levels). Pretreatment of rats with the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine prevented the increase in brain GABA and ALA levels with PLZ, but did not block the effect of VIG on GABA. These observations with tranylcypromine and PLZ support the hypothesis that an active metabolite of PLZ produced by the actions of MAO on this drug plays a major role in its GABA- and ALA-elevating actions.",M1
19195660,"Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic separation of diastereomers of beta-amino alcohols and microwave assisted synthesis of Marfey's reagent, its chiral variants and diastereomers.Ten chiral derivatizing reagents (CDRs) were synthesized by replacing the L-<e>Ala</e>-NH(2) moiety in Marfey's reagent (MR) by seven L-amino acid amides and three L-amino acids employing microwave irradiation (MW) and were characterized. Ten racemic amino alcohols were derivatized with these CDRs under MW. The diastereomers were separated on a reversed-phase C(18) column using binary mixtures of acetonitrile with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylammonium phosphate buffer (TEAP). In general, amino acid variants of MR provided better separation of diastereomers in comparison to amino acid amide variants. The method was also found successful for the separation of 20 diastereomers from a mixture.",M1
19193005,"Genetic incorporation of a metal-ion chelating amino acid into proteins as a biophysical probe.A metal-ion chelating amino acid, (8-hydroxyquinolin-3-yl)alanine, was genetically encoded in E. coli by an amber nonsense codon and corresponding orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. The amino acid was incorporated into TM0665 protein, and the mutant protein was cocrystallized with Zn(2+) to determine the structure by SAD phasing. The structure showed a high occupancy of the heavy metal bound to the HQ-<e>Ala</e> residue, and the heavy metal provided excellent phasing power to determine the structure. This method also facilitates the de novo design of metalloproteins with novel structures and functions, including fluorescent sensors.",M1
19185508,"Ab initio investigation of the hydration of deprotonated amino acids.The complexation of five deprotonated anionic amino acids (glycine, L-alanine, L-valine, L-Aspartic acid, and L-glutamine) with one water molecule, has been investigated using a MP2/63-11++G(d,p) approach fully accounting for the basis set superposition errors. For each amino acid, several energetic minima have been identified, and we provide spectroscopic information allowing to discriminate them. Our results strongly suggest that two complexes should coexist under the experimental conditions for [<e>Ala</e> - H](-), [Val - H](-), and [Asp - H](-). Comparisons with the experimental enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies recently obtained by Wincel [J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2008, 19, 1091-1097] show that our simulation reproduces the most significant structure/energy experimental trends, though the entropic changes induced by hydration are slightly overestimated.",M1
19177909,"Identification and determination of the intra- and extracellular aminopeptidase activity by synthetic L-<e>Ala</e>-, L-Tyr-, and L-Phe-beta-napthylamide.A simple, rapid and straightforward procedure for identification and determination of intracellular and extracellular activity of aminopeptidases employing synthetic substrates beta-naphtylamides of L-Ala, L-Phe, and L-Tyr was used. Poppy cells (Papaver somniferum L.) permeabilized by Tween 80 were immobilized via crosslinking by glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde immobilized poppy cells lost their viability and demonstrated significantly lower aminopeptidase activities than untreated control cells probably due to a damage to the enzyme active centre. Poppy cells immobilized by pectate and alginate have retained high activity of studied aminopeptidases. The culture medium (without cells) used for the identification and determination of extracellular enzyme activities retained 20-21%, whereas intracellular activities were estimated to be 79-80% of total enzyme activity. Thus the intracellular specific activity was 1.00-1.07 higher.",M1
19165720,"An approach to characterizing single-subunit mutations in multimeric prepores and pores of anthrax protective antigen.Heptameric pores formed by the protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin translocate the intracellular effector moieties of the toxin across the endosomal membrane to the cytosol of mammalian cells. We devised a protocol to characterize the effects of individual mutations in a single subunit of heptameric PA prepores (pore precursors) or pores. We prepared monomeric PA containing a test mutation plus an innocuous Cys-replacement mutation at a second residue (Lys563, located on the external surface of the prepore). The introduced Cys was biotinylated, and the protein was allowed to cooligomerize with a 20-fold excess of wild-type PA. Finally, biotinylated prepores were freed from wild-type prepores by avidin affinity chromatography. For the proof of principle, we examined single-subunit mutations of Asp425 and Phe427, two residues where <e>Ala</e> replacements have been shown to cause strong inhibitory effects. The single-subunit D425A mutation inhibited pore formation by &gt;10(4) and abrogated activity of PA almost completely in our standard cytotoxicity assay. The single-subunit F427A mutation caused approximately 100-fold inhibition in the cytotoxicity assay, and this effect was shown to result from a combination of strong inhibition of translocation and smaller effects on pore formation and ligand affinity. Our results show definitively that replacing a single residue in one subunit of the heptameric PA prepore can inhibit the transport activity of the oligomer almost completely-and by different mechanisms, depending on the specific residue mutated.",M1
19151092,"Aminoacyl-tRNA recognition by the FemXWv transferase for bacterial cell wall synthesis.Transferases of the Fem family catalyse peptide-bond formation by using aminoacyl-tRNAs and peptidoglycan precursors as donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. The specificity of Fem transferases is essential since mis-incorporated amino acids could act as chain terminators thereby preventing formation of a functional stress-bearing peptidoglycan network. Here we have developed chemical acylation of RNA helices with natural and non-proteinogenic amino acids to gain insight into the specificity of the model transferase FemX(Wv). Combining modifications in the RNA and aminoacyl moieties of the donor substrate revealed that unfavourable interactions of FemX(Wv) with the acceptor arm of tRNA(Gly) and with L-Ser or larger residues quantitatively accounts for the preferential transfer of L-<e>Ala</e> observed with complete aminoacyl-tRNAs. The main FemX(Wv) identity determinant was identified as the penultimate base pair (G(2)-C(71)) of the acceptor arm instead of G(3)*U(70) for the alanyl-tRNA synthetase. FemX(Wv) tolerated a configuration inversion of the Calpha of L-Ala but not the introduction of a second methyl on this atom. These results indicate that aminoacyl-tRNA recognition by FemX(Wv) is distinct from other components of the translation machinery and relies on the exclusion of bulky amino acids and of the sequence of tRNA(Gly) from the active site.",M1
19137603,"Conformational preferences of a short Aib/<e>Ala</e>-based water-soluble peptide as a function of temperature.The amino acid Aib predisposes a peptide to be helical with context-dependent preference for either 3(10)- or alpha- or a mixed helical conformation. Short peptides also show an inherent tendency to be unfolded. To characterize helical and unfolded states adopted by water-soluble Aib-containing peptides, the conformational preference of Ac-Ala-Aib-Ala-Lys-Ala-Aib-Lys-Ala-Lys-Ala-Aib-Tyr-NH(2) was determined by CD, NMR and MD simulations as a function of temperature. Temperature-dependent CD data indicated the contribution of two major components, each an admixture of helical and extended/polyproline II structures. Both right- and left-handed helical conformations were detected from deconvolution of CD data and (13)C NMR experiments. The presence of a helical backbone, more pronounced at the N-terminal, and a temperature-induced shift in alpha-helix/3(10)-helix equilibrium, more pronounced at the C-terminal, emerged from NMR data. Starting from polyproline II, the N-terminal of the peptide folded into a helical backbone in MD simulations within 5 ns at 60 degrees C. Longer simulations showed a mixed-helical backbone to be stable over the entire peptide at 5 degrees C while at 60 degrees C the mixed-helix was either stable at the N-terminus or occurred in short stretches through out the peptide, along with a significant population of polyproline II. Our results point towards conformational heterogeneity of water-soluble Aib-based peptide helices and the associated subtleties. The problem of analyzing CD and NMR data of both left- and right-handed helices are discussed, especially the validity of the ellipticity ratio [theta](222)/[theta](207), as a reporter of alpha-/3(10)- population ratio, in right- and left-handed helical mixtures.",M1
19128968,"Vancomycin resistance: modeling backbone variants with D-<e>Ala</e>-D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Lac peptides.To seek vancomycin analogs with broader antibacterial activity, effects of backbone modifications for the agylcon 2 on binding with D-Ala-D-Ala- and D-Ala-D-Lac-containing peptides were investigated by Monte Carlo/free energy perturbation (MC/FEP) calculations. The experimental trend in binding affinities for 2 with three tripeptides was well reproduced. Possible modifications of the peptide bond between residues 4 and 5 were then considered, specifically for conversion of the OCNH linkage to CH(2)NH(2)(+) (6), FCCH (7), HCCH (8), and HNCO (9). The MC/FEP results did not yield binding improvements for 7, 8, and 9, though the fluorovinyl replacement is relatively benign. The previously reported analog 6 remains as the only variant that exhibits improved affinity for the D-Ala-D-Lac sequence and acceptable affinity for the D-Ala-D-Ala sequence.",M1
19113858,"Competition between reversible aggregation and loop formation in denatured iso-1-cytochrome c.The competition between intramolecular histidine-heme loop formation and ligand-mediated oligomer formation in the denatured state is investigated for two yeast iso-1-cytochrome c variants, AcH26I52 and AcA25H26I52. Besides the native His 18 heme ligand, both variants contain a single His at position 26. The AcA25H26I52 variant has Pro 25 mutated to <e>Ala</e>. The concentration dependence of the apparent pK(a) for His 26-heme binding in 3 M guanidine hydrochloride indicates that the P25A mutation disfavors oligomerization mediated by intermolecular heme ligation by 10-fold. Single- and double-pH-jump stopped-flow experiments with the AcH26I52 variant show that fast phases for His-heme bond formation and breakage are due to intramolecular loop formation and slow phases for His-heme bond formation and breakage are due to intermolecular aggregation. The presence of two closely spaced slow phases in the kinetics of loop formation for both variants suggests that intermolecular His 26-heme ligation results in both dimers and higher-order aggregates. The P25A mutation slows formation and speeds breakdown of an initial dimer, demonstrating a strong effect of local sequence on aggregation. Analysis of the kinetic data yields equilibrium constants for intramolecular loop formation and intermolecular dimerization at pH 7.1 and indicates that the rate constant for intermolecular aggregation is very fast at this pH (10(7)-10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). In light of the very fast rates of aggregation in the denatured state, comparison of models involving reversible or irreversible oligomerization steps suggests that equilibrium control of the partitioning between folding and aggregation is advantageous for productive protein folding in vivo.",M1
19090571,"Influence of ionization on the conformational preferences of peptide models. Ramachandran surfaces of N-formyl-glycine amide and N-formyl-alanine amide radical cations.Ramachandran maps of neutral and ionized HCO-Gly-NH2 and HCO-<e>Ala</e>-NH2 peptide models have been built at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of calculation. Direct optimizations using B3LYP and the recently developed MPWB1K functional have also been carried out, as well as single-point calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory with the 6-311++G(2df,2p) basis set. Results indicate that for both peptide models ionization can cause drastic changes in the shape of the PES in such a way that highly disallowed regions in neutral PES become low-energy regions in the radical cation surface. The structures localized in such regions, epsilonL+* and epsilonD+* are highly stabilized due to the formation of 2-centre-3-electron interactions between the two carbonyl oxygens. Inclusion of solvent effects by the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) shows that the solute-solvent interaction energy plays an important role in determining the stability order.",M1
19088442,"A highly conserved alanine in the S6 domain of the hERG1 K+ channel is required for normal gating.The central cavity of K(+)-selective ion channels is lined by four S6 transmembrane alpha-helices. An <e>Ala</e> residue is located near the midpoint of each S6 and marks the narrowest point of the central cavity. In hERG1 channels, we determined the functional consequences of substituting this conserved Ala (Ala653) with other hydrophobic or charged amino acids. Mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and ionic currents measured by using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Substitution of Ala653 with bulkier hydrophobic residues (Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Trp) did not prevent ion conduction, but the mutant channels activated at more negative potentials compared to wild-type channels. The half-point for voltage dependent activation was shifted by -54 mV for the most conservative hydrophobic mutation, A653V. Oxidation of A653C hERG1 channels induced a maintained current at negative membrane potentials. This effect was not reversible with dithiothreitol, indicating that the sulfhydryl side-chains of Cys653 were oxidized to a negatively charged sulfinic or sulfonic acid. Substitution of Ala653 with acidic (Asp, Glu) or basic (Arg, Lys) residues prevented channel deactivation. Thus, an Ala at position 653 in hERG1 is required for normal voltage dependence of channel gating and a charged residue in this position prevents channel closure.",M1
20415739,"The influence of temperature on 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic reaction in keratinocytes in vitro.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Based on the observation that increasing skin temperature could improve 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) penetration and accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the ALA-based photodynamic therapy (PDT), this study was designed to investigate how temperature change varied the therapeutic effect of ALA-based PDT in vitro. METHODS: HaCat cells were cultured with or without ALA at various temperatures. ALA uptake and PpIX accumulation were analyzed before laser irradiation as the baseline. After irradiation, cell death and cytokine secretions in the media, including interleukin (IL)-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were assayed, and the morphological changes were recorded. RESULTS: With increasing temperature, the amount of ALA uptake, intracellular PpIX concentration and cell death increased in both the PDT and the non-PDT groups. Secretions of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and bFGF also increased and reached a peak around 44-47 degrees C and then declined at a higher temperature. This biphasic response might be due to protein thermolysis that occurs when cells reach beyond thermal tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Elevating temperature could augment photodynamic reactions to a certain extent, but adverse effects occurred when cells were overheated.",M2

To examine the safety and efficacy of the photosensitizer 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) in patients with moderate-to-severe acne, a randomized, split-face study, using ALA on one side of the face, was followed by exposure of the entire face to 532 nm potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser. Eight patients completed three treatments for up to 12 weeks. The average acne grading at baseline was 3.20, and improved to 2.12 at 12 weeks (34% improvement). Use of ALA improved acne by 52% compared with 32% on the side that did not receive the photosensitizer. Further studies are warranted to establish optimal parameters for photosensitizer use combined with light therapy for treatment of moderate-to-severe acne; however, the combined use of ALA and a 532 nm laser suggests promising results for acne treatment.",M2
20230992,"Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) for upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma (UT-TCC): evolution of a new technique.INTRODUCTION: Transitional cell carcinoma of renal pelvis and ureter account was traditionally treated with nephroureterectomy. With the advent of rigid and flexible ureteroscopes endoscopic access to the ureter and renal pelvis for diagnosis and treatment has become a reality. We did fluorescence ureteroscopy using oral 5-<e>ALA</e> to diagnose upper tract urothelial tumours for four patients. Here we describe this technique and assess its feasibility to diagnose ureteric and renal pelvicalyceal tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective pilot study was performed to assess the feasibility of PDD using oral 5-amino levulinic acid (ALA) for upper urinary tract tumours. RESULTS: Four patients underwent PDD guided flexible ureteroscopy of the upper urinary tract. Obvious exophytic tumour seen on white light was also seen as red fluorescence on blue light. All areas with red fluorescence were biopsied (including additional areas not seen on white light) and were confirmed to be transitional cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Photodynamic diagnosis using oral 5-ALA and subsequent treatment of upper tract urothelial tumours is safe and feasible with additional advantages of detecting lesions not visualised on conventional white light endoscopy.",M2

METHODS: A total of 78 Chinese patients with Grade 4 severe facial acne were treated with 1-3 courses of ALA PDT. ALA cream (10%) was applied topically to acne lesions for 3 h. The lesions were irradiated by a LED light of 633 nm at dose levels of 50-70 J/cm(2) at 66 mW/cm(2). Clinical assessment was conducted before and after treatment up to 6 months. RESULTS: 22% of patients showed excellent improvement after one-course treatment and another 34% showed excellent improvement after two-course. The rest (44%) required three-course treatment to further reduce the number and size of residual lesions. Adverse effects were minimal. The symptoms and signs in recurrent cases (14%) were much milder and responded well to conventional topical medication. CONCLUSIONS: ALA PDT is a simple, safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of severe acne. Further studies to fully understand its mechanisms and optimize its effectiveness are needed.",M2
20210488,"Preferential accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX in breast cancer: a comprehensive study on six breast cell lines with varying phenotypes.We describe the potential of 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence as a source of contrast for margin detection in commonly diagnosed breast cancer subtypes. Fluorescence intensity of PpIX in untreated and ALA-treated normal mammary epithelial and breast cancer cell lines of varying estrogen receptor expression were quantitatively imaged with confocal microscopy. Percentage change in fluorescence intensity integrated over 610-700 nm (attributed to PpIX) of posttreated compared to pretreated cells showed statistically significant differences between four breast cancer and two normal mammary epithelial cell lines. However, a direct comparison of post-treatment PpIX fluorescence intensities showed no differences between breast cancer and normal mammary epithelial cell lines due to confounding effects by endogenous fluorescence from flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Clinically, it is impractical to obtain pre- and post-treatment images. Thus, spectral imaging was demonstrated as a means to remove the effects of endogenous FAD fluorescence allowing for discrimination between post-treatment PpIX fluorescence of four breast cancer and two normal mammary epithelial cell lines. Fluorescence spectral imaging of ALA-treated breast cancer cells showed preferential PpIX accumulation regardless of malignant phenotype and suggests a useful contrast mechanism for discrimination of residual cancer at the surface of breast tumor margins.",M2
20207156,"Photosensitization-based inactivation of food pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in vitro and on the surface of packaging material.The study was focused on the susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes ATCL3C 7644 cells and biofilms to non-thermal antimicrobial treatment - photosensitization in vitro and after adhesion to the surface of packaging material. L. monocytogenes was incubated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) (7.5 mM) for 0-2h and illuminated with visible light. The LED-based light source used for the illumination emitted light lambda=400 nm with energy density 20 mW/cm(2). The illumination time varied 0-20 min, and a total light dose reached 0-24 J/cm(2). The obtained data indicate that L. monocytogenes produces endogenous porphyrins after incubation with 7.5mM ALA. Subsequent illumination of cells remarkably inactivates (4 log) them in vitro. Photosensitization diminished population of Listeria cells adhered onto the packaging material by 3.7 log and inactivated bacterial biofilms by 3.1 log. It was shown that antimicrobial efficiency of photosensitization depended on the illumination time, incubation with ALA time as well as on the used ALA concentration. In conclusion, cells and biofilms of L. monocytogenes ATCL3C 7644 can be effectively inactivated by ALA-based photosensitization in the solution as well as adhered onto the surface of packaging material. Obtained data support the idea, that photosensitization as non-thermal and effective antimicrobial treatment has potential to develop into environmentally safe, surface decontamination technique.",M2

Using SPPS, the peptides were coupled to GABA, Nip, and <e>ALA</e> to examine their passive BBB permeation by means of PAMPA and their lipophilicity by IAMC. Unaided, these nonpermeating drugs alone did not cross the PAMPA barrier and the BBB passively; however, the peptides tested as potential BBB shuttles transferred them by passive transfer through the PAMPA phospholipid. The permeability of peptides that showed the highest permeability in PAMPA, and Ac-N-MePhe-(N-MePhe)(3)-CONH(2) as the parent peptide was also examined in bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BBMECs). These peptide-based BBB shuttles open up the possibility to overcome the formidable obstacle of the BBB, thereby achieving drug delivery to the brain.",M2
20166166,"Photodynamic photorejuvenation of the face with a combination of microneedling, red light, and broadband pulsed light.BACKGROUND: High efficacy and safety, coupled with in-office, short contact protocols have made photodynamic therapy (PDT) with aminolevulenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) for the treatment of actinic keratoses a mainstay option over the last decade. Clinical improvement in photoaged skin has also been reported to accompany PDT treatments. The study objective was to maximize epidermal penetration and subsequent activation of ALA for the treatment of photodamaged facial skin, utilizing a microneedle roller prior to incubation and combined irradiation with red light and broadband pulsed light in a single treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-face treatment of 21 patients was performed with 630 nm light and broadband pulsed light after multiple passes with a microneedle roller and 1-hour ALA incubation. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement, scored during two separate live assessments by three physicians blinded to previous scores, using a 5-point standardized photoaging scale. The secondary endpoint was evaluation of patient satisfaction based on a quartile scale comparing baseline to 6-month post-treatment photography. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement was seen in the global photoaging scores, as well as sub-components of the scale (fine lines, mottled pigmentation, sallowness, tactile roughness, and telangiectasias) at 3 months as compared with baseline live assessment, and at 6-month live assessment compared with the 3 months. In addition, 90% of patients judged clinical improvement to be greater than 50% at 6 months compared to baseline photography. CONCLUSION: Use of a microneedle roller to  pre-treat  prior to application of ALA appears to be well tolerated and allows for even absorption and perhaps deeper penetration of ALA following a defined incubation period. Use of red light and broadband pulsed light allowed for deeper activation of ALA, potentially accounting for marked clinical improvement in photoaging.",M2
20166163,"Radiant near infrared light emitting Diode exposure as skin preparation to enhance photodynamic therapy inflammatory type acne treatment outcome.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An alternative approach in the treatment of acne vulgaris is photodynamic therapy (PDT) that uses light and aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production to eradicate Propionibacterium acnes found in acne lesions. PpIX formation is dependent on ALA percutaneaous penetration. In this study, to enhance ALA penetration and subsequent accumulation of PpIX, skin temperature was increased with radiant infrared (IR) prior to ALA-PDT application and compared to ALA-PDT alone in the treatment of inflammatory acne. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients exhibiting inflammatory acne with a lesion count of &gt; or =10 were assigned to a split face or split back group. One side was pre-treated for 15 minutes with radiant IR light emitting diode (LED) (970 nm), while the other side was used as control. ALA was then applied after which PDT LED (630 nm) was performed on the entire face or back surface. Blinded lesion counts and clinical global assessment of severity were performed based on digital photographs before and 4 weeks after the PDT procedure. RESULTS: This randomized, controlled, and rater-blinded trial revealed a significant difference in median reduction of inflammatory lesions on the IR pre-treated (73%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 51-81%) versus the control side (38%, 95% CI 8-55%) 1 month after PDT (P&lt;0.0001). Clinical assessment of severity was also significantly lower on the IR-treated side than on the control side (median 1, 95% CI 0.74-1.34 vs. 2, 95% CI 1.17-1.72). No unusual treatment-related adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The reported therapeutic effects may be due to enhanced induction of alterations in transcutaneous diffusion kinetics of the photosensitizer at higher skin temperature and/or conversion of ALA to PpIX. Pre-PDT radiant IR LED exposure appears to be a promising method to enhance PDT efficacy for the treatment of acne lesions.",M2
20153251,"Genotoxicity evaluation in workers occupationally exposed to lead.Lead (Pb) is a widely used heavy metal with a broad industrial usage. Nevertheless, Pb is a serious public health issue as it is one of the most widespread environmental and industrial toxins. The aim of this investigation was to assess the genotoxicity of Pb using the comet assay, micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) test. Blood and urinary Pb content, levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in the erythrocytes (E-ALAD) and delta-aminolevulinic acid in urine (U-<e>ALA</e>) were determined. The exposure associated oxidative stress was also studied. The study group comprised of 90 male Pb recovery unit workers and 90 matched controls. The results indicated that the exposed workers had a significantly higher mean comet tail length than that of controls (P&lt;0.05). Analysis of micronuclei in buccal epithelial cells (BEC's) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) revealed that there was a significant increase in frequency of MN in exposed subjects than controls. The frequency of aberrant metaphases was also found to be significantly elevated in the Pb exposed workers. The levels of antioxidant enzymes were relatively reduced (P&gt;0.05) while the rate of lipid peroxidation was higher in the exposed subjects. Blood and urinary Pb concentrations were found to be higher in exposed workers than in controls. E-ALAD levels were reduced and U-ALA levels were elevated in the exposed subjects in comparison to controls. Results of analysis, taking the confounding factors into consideration provide evidence for the association of Pb exposure and genotoxicity, and predict the increased risk of cancer to the exposed workers. In view of the observed results, it can be strongly concluded that the workers comprise the risk group and adequate safety, precautionary and preventive measures could only minimize exposure and the related health hazards.",M2
20128809,"Delta-aminolevulinic acid is a substrate for the amino acid transporter SLC36A1 (hPAT1).BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: delta-Aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is used in cancer patients for photodynamic diagnosis or therapy. Oral administration of ALA has been used in patients with prostate and bladder cancer. The present aim was to investigate the mechanism of intestinal absorption of ALA and its transport via the amino acid transporter SLC36A1. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro investigations of ALA affinity for and uptake via SLC36A1 and SLC15A1 were performed in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Interaction of ALA with SLC15A1 was investigated in MDCK/SLC15A1 cells, whereas interactions with SLC36A1 were investigated in COS-7 cells transiently expressing SLC36A1. KEY RESULTS: ALA inhibited SLC36A1-mediated L-[(3)H]Pro and SLC15A1-mediated [(14)C]Gly-Sar uptake in Caco-2 cell monolayers with IC(50) values of 11.3 and 2.1 mM respectively. In SLC36A1-expressing COS-7 cells, the uptake of [(14)C]ALA was saturable with a K(m) value of 6.8 +/- 3.0 mM and a V(max) of 96 +/- 13 pmol x cm(-2) x min(-1). Uptake of [(14)C]ALA was pH and concentration dependent, and could be inhibited by glycine, proline and GABA. In a membrane potential assay, translocation of ALA via SLC36A1 was concentration dependent, with a K(m) value of 3.8 +/- 1.0 mM. ALA is thus a substrate for SLC36A1. In Caco-2 cells, apical [(14)C]ALA uptake was pH dependent, but Na(+) independent, and completely inhibited by 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan and L-4,4'-biphenylalanyl-l-proline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS. ALA was a substrate for SLC36A1, and the apical absorption in Caco-2 cell was only mediated by SLC36A1 and SLC15A1. This advances our understanding of intestinal absorption mechanisms of ALA, as well as its potential for drug interactions.",M2
20108311,"5-Aminolevulinic acid is a promising marker for detection of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement.BACKGROUND: Because of intratumoral heterogeneity, diffusely infiltrating gliomas that lack significant contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging are prone to tissue sampling error. Subsequent histologic undergrading may delay adjuvant treatments. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) leads to accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant glioma tissue, and is currently used for resection of malignant gliomas. The aim of this study was to clarify whether 5-ALA might serve as marker for visualization of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement for precise intraoperative tissue sampling. METHODS: 5-ALA was administered in 17 patients with diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement. During glioma resection, positive fluorescence was noted by a modified neurosurgical microscope. Intraoperative topographic correlation of focal 5-ALA fluorescence with maximum (11)C-methionine positron emission tomography uptake (PET(max)) was performed. Multiple tissue samples were taken from areas of positive and/or negative 5-ALA fluorescence. Histopathological diagnosis was established according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2007 criteria. Cell proliferation was assessed for multiregional samples by MIB-1 labeling index (LI). RESULTS: Focal 5-ALA fluorescence was observed in 8 of 9 patients with WHO grade III diffusely infiltrating gliomas. All 8 of 8 WHO grade II diffusely infiltrating gliomas were 5-ALA negative. Focal 5-ALA fluorescence correlated topographically with PET(max) in all patients. MIB-1 LI was significantly higher in 5-ALA-positive than in nonfluorescent areas within a given tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that 5-ALA is a promising marker for intraoperative visualization of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas with nonsignificant contrast enhancement. Unaffected by intraoperative brain shift, 5-ALA may increase the precision of tissue sampling during tumor resection for histopathological grading, and therefore optimize allocation of patients to adjuvant treatments.",M2
20077492,"Optical touch pointer for fluorescence guided glioblastoma resection using 5-aminolevulinic acid.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Total tumor resection in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is difficult to achieve due to the tumor's infiltrative way of growing and morphological similarity to the surrounding functioning brain tissue. The diagnosis is usually subjectively performed using a surgical microscope. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a hand-held optical touch pointer using a fluorescence spectroscopy system to quantitatively distinguish healthy from malignant brain tissue intraoperatively. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A fluorescence spectroscopy system with pulsed modulation was designed considering optimum energy delivery to the tissue, minimal photobleaching of PpIX and omission of the ambient light background in the operating room (OR). 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) of 5 mg/kg body weight was given to the patients with a presumed GBM prior to surgery. During the surgery a laser pulse at 405 nm was delivered to the tissue. PpIX in glioblastoma tumor cells assigned with peaks at 635 and 704 nm was detected using a fiber optical probe. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: By using the pulsed fluorescence spectroscopy, PpIX fluorescence is quantitatively detected in the GBM. An effective suppression of low power lamp background from the recorded spectra in addition to a significant reduction of high power surgical lights is achieved.",M2
20069433,"Efficacy of a methyl ester of 5-aminolevulinic acid in photodynamic therapy for ovarian cancers.PURPOSE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new approach to cancer treatment that utilizes photochemical reactions induced by a combination of an oncophilic photosensitizing agent and laser light. With an aim to apply PDT for intraperitoneal disseminated foci of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancers, the present study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor effect of PDT using a methyl ester of 5-aminolevulinic acid (Methyl-<e>ALA</e>) on various types of human ovarian cancer in a subcutaneous xenograft model in nude mice and to elucidate the mechanism of its antitumor effect. METHODS: HTOA, MCAS, and TOV21G cell lines derived from human ovarian serous, mucinous, and clear cell adenocarcinoma, respectively, were used in this study. The mice in the treatment group and in the control group received an intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/kg of Methyl-ALA and PBS alone, respectively. PDT was administered by 10 min irradiation using a 150 W halogen light, 3 h after Methyl-ALA or PBS injection. Each mouse received PDT twice a week for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Methyl-ALA-PDT significantly suppressed the growth of HTOA tumors as compared to control, whereas there was no significant effect on the growth of MCAS or TOV21G tumors. Methyl-ALA-PDT significantly increased apoptosis in implanted HTOA tumors as well as cultured cells. Western blot analysis showed that amount of expression of milk fat globule-EGF-factor 8, which binds to apoptotic cells and thereby facilitates their phagocytosis, significantly increased in HTOA tumors receiving Methyl-ALA-PDT, compared with untreated HTOA tumors. In addition, reduced vascular endothelial growth factor and CD34-positive microvessel density were found in solid HTOA tumors treated by Methyl-ALA-PDT, suggesting that the antitumor effect of Methyl-ALA-PDT is due to induction of apoptosis and reduction of angiogenesis. In comparison with HTOA cells, HPLC analysis demonstrated a significantly smaller intracellular amount of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in MCAS and TOV21G cells. PpIX is readily converted from Methyl-ALA and elicts photocytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Methyl-ALA-PDT could be an effective treatment in ovarian cancer and should be tested to apply intraperitoneally disseminated micro-foci during surgery.",M2
20061079,"Cordectomy as final treatment option for diffuse intramedullary malignant glioma using 5-<e>ALA</e> fluorescence-guided resection.BACKGROUND: We present a case of an anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO-grade III, AA III) in a 27-year-old woman treated by spinal cordectomy. The patient was pretreated by surgery, radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy and repeat surgery at recurrence. Later on, she developed paraplegia and a diffuse severe pain syndrome. MRI demonstrated intramedullar invasion from T12 to T9. To assess tumor invasion intraoperatively, we used tumor fluorescence derived from 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). PATIENTS COURSE: The spinal cord was amputated caudally to the root entry zones of the T10 sensory roots. Additional cordectomy was performed because of tumor infiltration at the cut end to T9 as identified by intraoperative tumor fluorescence, and as verified histologically. The final transected level was between T8 and T9, and the cut end did not reveal any tumor invasion intraoperatively by tumor fluorescence and postoperatively by MRI and with regard to the pathological result. After surgery, the patient was unchanged concerning spasticity, motor and sensory function, and showed complete relief of pain. She refused additional adjuvant therapy. The patient is free of recurrence 15 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Our observation suggests 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resections to be useful in the context of malignant spinal cord gliomas. Furthermore, our particular case indicates that palliative spinal cordectomy with a wide margin and intraoperative resection using fluorescence guidance may be a final option for patients with recurrent spinal malignant glioma presenting with complete deficit below the lesion.",M2
20010496,"Effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in the treatment of lichen sclerosus: cell changes in immunohistochemistry.BACKGROUND: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) affects primarily women at postmenopausal age and its background remains unknown. One of the treatment modalities is photodynamic therapy (PDT). The aim was to investigate the efficacy of PDT in women with LS and the analysis of protein expression before and after PDT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 04.2006-01.2008 28 women, with LS underwent photodynamic diagnosis and next PDT: six-courses every second week with using 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) as a photosensitizer. Punch biopsies were taken before and after treatment and immunohistochemistry was done with Ki67,CD44,CD34 and CD3. RESULTS: Before PDT all patients suffered from pruritus and after in 89.3% the relief was noted. The histological examination showed that 35.7% patients hadn't LS after therapy completion. Anti-CD44 staining intensities was scored qualitatively - there were no statistical difference at the expression of protein CD44 in the epidermis (p&gt;0.05) before and after therapy. Microvessel density was assessed at the hot spots, marked with anti-CD34. Statistical difference in AVD before and after therapy: (p&lt;0.05). The staining intensity of Ki-67 didn't differ before and after PDT (p&gt;0.05). The expression of CD3 on T lymphocytes showed statistical difference of the lymphocytic infiltration before and after PDT ( p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The immunohistochemical staining in vulvar LS showed increasing microvessel density and decreasing lymphocytic infiltration. There were a clinical, and less histological improvement in patients with LS. We suggest that the photodynamic therapy is an effective, alternative treatment in some but not all patients with LS. Therefore, further studies are needed.",M2
19999130,"[Clinical experience with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) guided by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)]PURPOSE: To report our clinical experience regarding transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) guided by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) with intravesical instillations of 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and to assess the usefulness of the therapeutic method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TUR-Bt guided by PDD was performed in 57 patients of which 47 were men and 10 women with a median age of 74.3 years (range 45-90), 36 were primary cases and 21 were recurrent cases with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Two to two and half hours prior to endoscopy 1.5 g ALA dissolved in 50 ml of 8.4% sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) solution was instilled intravesically. For fluorescence excitation a blue light source (D-LIGHT System, Karl Storz Endoscopy Japan K.K.) was used. The tumorous lesions under white light guidance and the lesion with fluorescent excitation under blue (fluorescence) light guidance were taken by cold cup as a biopsy and also resected sequentially. To evaluate the accuracy of PDD, the levels in images of the ALA-induced fluorescence were compared with the pathological results. To evaluate the availability of TUR-Bt guided by PDD, survival Analysis regarding vesical recurrence was retrospectively examined compared to the cases underwent conventional TUR-Bt under white light guidance. Moreover, in these cases, multivariate analysis using Cox proportional-hazards model was performed to detect the clinico-pathological factor independently contribute to improving prognosis. (Results) In the 301 specimens obtained from 57 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of PDD were 92.5% and 60.1%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of conventional endoscopic examination under white light guidance were 81.6% and 79.5%, respectively. Median follow-up period was 19.1 (range 8.6-49.9) months in 57 patients underwent TUR-Bt guided by PDD. Eight of 57 patients recurred and recurrence-free survival rate was 88.2 +/- 0.1% (at 12 months) and 76.2 +/- 0.1% (24-48 months). Median follow-up period was 49.9 (5.0-145.0) months in 149 patients underwent conventional TUR-Bt. Ninety-nine of 149 patients recurred and recurrence-free survival rate was 60.3 +/- 0.0% (12 months) and 31.6 +/- 0.0% (24-48 months). There was statistical significance in recurrence-free survival rate between these 2 therapeutic groups (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed the independent factor contribute to improving prognosis was only TUR-Bt guided by PDD (hazard ratio 0.279, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: It was suggested that TUR-Bt guided by PDD might reduce the risk of vesical recurrence in the early stage after operation of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",M2
19812913,"Bulk flow and diffusion revisited, and clinical applications.The first Klatzo-Lecture pays homage to an exceptional academician, scientist and teacher. The author spent nearly 1 year in Klatzo's laboratory at the NHI in Bethesda, and the first part of results presented here originate directly from this collaboration. It was shown that following cortical injury, movement of edema fluid into the tissue occurs by bulk flow, and that the driving force is a small tissue pressure gradient. Resolution of edema fluid is achieved by clearance into the ventricular and subarachnoid CSF, is enhanced in the presence of pressure gradients and is supported by re-absorption into capillaries. Using appropriate techniques, the formation rate as well as clearance of edema into CSF and tissue resorption could be determined in human brain metastases and malignant gliomas. Three examples of clinical applications based on the discussed mechanisms are presented: a. Fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas is based on the accumulation of 5-<e>ALA</e> in tumour cells; there being enzymatically converted to PP-IX, a compound with deep red fluorescence. This fluorescence is used for the more accurate surgical removal of gliomas. b. Radioimmunotherapy of gliomas uses an anti-tenascin antibody, coupled with a nuclide, administered postoperatively into the tumour cavity, from where it diffuses into tissue, couples to the receptor at the glioma cells. Then the isotope destroys the tumour cells. c. Convection-enhanced delivery is based on the interstitial infusion of an appropriate cytotoxic drug into the white matter at low pressure. Thus, the method employs bulk flow, distributes a drug in a larger tissue volume and eventually achieves drug concentrations greater than systemic levels. Experimental studies and clinical results are presented for all three clinical applications.I am very grateful to Z. Czernicki and the organizing group for being offered the great honour of presenting the first Igor Klatzo Lecture. In this report first previous results of bulk flow and diffusion in the development and resolution of brain edema will be revisited, then some recent examples will be shown as to how this knowledge of diffusion and bulk flow can be transferred into clinical applications.A great part of the work on bulk flow and diffusion was done during a stay in I. Klatzo's laboratory in Bethesda in 1973/1974 (Fig. 1). Since then a long collaboration developed with I. Klatzo and M. Spatz. Due to given limits, I will concentrate on the studies of our group. Unfortunately it will not be possible to mention all the important groups who have contributed by essential studies.",M2
19955842,"Regulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated protoporphyrin IX accumulation in human urothelial carcinomas.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the regulatory mechanism of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis mediated by 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) in human urothelial carcinoma (UC), leading to improved accuracy in photodynamic diagnosis and therapy using ALA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PpIX accumulation in cultured UC cells after incubation for 1-5 h with 0.5-5 mM ALA was analyzed by fluorescence analysis using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry technique. RESULTS: PpIX fluorescence mediated by ALA was increased, and the intensity of PpIX fluorescence was time-dependently increased in UC cells compared to noncancerous cells. The distribution of endogenous PpIX fluorescence primarily coincided with mitochondria, and then increased at a specific perinuclear region in the cells during the time of incubation. The ALA-mediated PpIX synthesis in UC cells was suppressed by beta-alanine, an inhibitor of beta-transporters of cell membrane, and carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone, an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, the ALA-mediated PpIX accumulation was increased by deferoxamine, an iron chelator, manganese and nitric oxide, which is contributed to PpIX metabolism by inhibiting ferrochelatase activity, generated by a nitric oxide-generating reagent NOC-18. As observed above, ALA-mediated PpIX synthesis in human UC cells was regulated by the process of ALA uptake, ALA conversion to PpIX and metabolism of accumulated PpIX to heme. CONCLUSIONS: This shows that the suppression of ferrochelatase increased PpIX accumulation in UC cells using small amount of ALA, thus leading to an improved clinical practicability of photodynamic diagnosis and therapy.",M2
19934966,"Five-aminolevulinic acid for fluorescence-guided resection of recurrent malignant gliomas: a phase ii study.OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) fluorescence guidance for resection of recurrent malignant brain tumors. METHODS: In a multicenter prospective, single-arm, uncontrolled phase II study, 36 patients with recurrent glioma (World Health Organization grade III/IV) received 5-ALA before surgery. After microsurgical resection, biopsies from pathological and nonpathological areas (as identified under conventional white light) were obtained to determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of 5-ALA-induced tissue fluorescence in detecting tumors. Adverse events, neurological examinations, and survival data were documented for a minimal follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS: The patient-based PPV, defined as the percentage of patients showing positive tumor cell identification in all biopsies taken from areas of weak and strong fluorescence was 97.2% for pathological areas and 79.4% in nonpathological areas. Within areas of strong fluorescence, PPV was higher (91.7%) compared with that of weak fluorescence (82.4%). On the biopsy level for nonpathological-appearing tissue under white light (157 biopsies), the PPV of tissue fluorescence was 93.0% compared with 99.5% in pathological-appearing tissue (197 biopsies). Again, within areas of strong fluorescence, PPV was higher (96.9%) compared with that of weak fluorescence (90.3%). There were no adverse events pertaining to the study drug. CONCLUSION: 5-ALA fluorescence has a high predictive value for the detection of tumor in recurrent gliomas. Prior treatment modalities, such as radiation or chemotherapy, do not invalidate the fluorescence guidance with 5-ALA. 5-ALA fluorescence guidance is an effective surgical adjunct in the surgery of recurrent malignant gliomas.",M2
19932453,"Long-term follow-up of topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid photodynamic therapy diode laser single session for non-melanoma skin cancer.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the association of a light source and light sensitive agents in order to cause the selective death of tumor cells. To evaluate topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) and diode laser photodynamic single session therapy single session for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), a long-term follow-up was performed. Nineteen Bowen's disease (BD) and 15 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions were submitted to 6-h topical and occlusive 20% 5-ALA plus DMSO and EDTA, and later were exposed to 630 nm diode laser, 100 or 300 J cm(-2) dose. At 3 months tumor-free rate was 91.2% (31/34) whereas at 60 months, 57.7% (15/26), slightly higher in BCC (63.6%; 7/11). The relation between the reduction of the clinical response and the increase of tumor dimension observed at 18 months was lost at 60 months. The sBCC recurrence was earlier compared to the nBCC one. ALA-PDT offered important advantages: it is minimally invasive, an option for patients under risk of surgical complications; clinical feasibility; treatment of multiple lesions in only one session or lesions in poor healing sites and superior esthetical results. However, the recurrence rate increase after ALA-PDT diode laser single session can be observed at long-term follow-up, and the repetitive sessions, an additional advantage of the method, is strongly recommended. The clinical response and recurrence time seem to be related to the laser light dose and NMSC types/sub-types, thickness and dimension, which must be considered for the choice of the ALA-PDT.",M2
19926165,"Photorejuvenation induced by 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy in patients with actinic keratosis: a histologic analysis.BACKGROUND: Repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun results in premature photoaging. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be effective for treatment of photoaging, although the data from most studies have been based on clinical observation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-PDT induced histologic changes suggesting photorejuvenation. METHODS: Fourteen patients with one to three actinic keratoses on the face were treated twice with ALA-PDT by using a 1200 W metal halogen lamp at 1-month intervals. Skin biopsy before and 1 month after the PDT was performed. Twenty-five pairs of specimens were obtained. We examined the specimens with routine and immunohistochemical staining and evaluated the parameters associated with photoaging by using image analysis. RESULTS: After ALA-PDT, the mean epidermal thickness and dermal inflammatory infiltrate were reduced. The total collagen volume in the dermis significantly increased with expression of type I and III procollagen. The level of transforming growth factor beta and transforming growth factor beta type II receptors in the epidermis also increased. The elastotic material with co-localizing fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin expression in the dermis decreased after treatment. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases-1, -3, and -12 also decreased. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by the small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: ALA-PDT resulted in histological changes indicating restoration of photoaged skin. These data suggest that ALA-PDT could be effective for photorejuvenation.",M2
19925929,"Pain associated with aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy of skin disease.BACKGROUND: Pain during topical aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) limits the use of this treatment of skin diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to summarize the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ALA-PDT-related pain, and to explore factors contributing to pain induction. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to identify all clinical PDT trials (2000-2008) that used ALA or methyl-ALA, enrolled at least 10 patients per trial, and used a semiquantitative pain scale. RESULTS: In all, 43 articles were identified for review. Pain intensity is associated with lesion size and location and can be severe for certain diagnoses, such as plaque-type psoriasis. Results are inconsistent for the correlation of pain with light source, wavelength of light, fluence rate, and total light dose. Cooling represents the best topical intervention. LIMITATIONS: Pain perception differs widely between patients and can contribute to variability in the reported results. CONCLUSION: Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, cold/menthol receptors (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8), and vanilloid/capsaicin receptors (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1) may be involved in pain perception during ALA-PDT and are therefore worthy of further investigation.",M2
19925756,"[Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Literature review]Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent and incident neoplastic conditions in the Western world. Its clinical management involves significant costs for health systems. Diagnosis and treatment are based on direct visualization of the disease and on detection of flat forms having no specific morphology and which are sometimes overlooked. Prognosis of NMIBC often depends on quality of transurethral resection and on early detection of undifferentiated flat forms. Cystoscopy using photosensitive substances such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) or hexyl aminolevulinic acid (HAL) achieves overdetection rates of 29 % for bladder neogrowths and 59% for carcinoma in situ. This overdetection ability results in an increased disease-free survival and a longer time to the first relapse. Increased costs resulting from use of these resources are compensated by a lower number of or delayed performance of cystectomies, resections, and instrumentations. It is concluded that PDD should be universally used, rather than in high risk patients only.that has been shown in both animal studies and human tumors.",M2
19921749,"Intravesical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid from water-in-oil nano/submicron-emulsion systems.The present work reports on the development of water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions for the intravesical administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>). The physicochemical properties of droplet size, zeta potential, and viscosity of the emulsions are characterized and the ability of the emulsions to release ALA following in vitro application is tested. The delivery systems are administered intravesically for 1 and 3 h in rats to examine the drug accumulation in bladder tissue. The mean size and zeta potential of the emulsions are 50-200 nm and -3 to -14 mV, respectively. The loading of ALA into the emulsions resulted in a slower and sustained release. The release extent was found to be inversely related to the droplet size of the emulsions. The emulsions did not increase the drug permeation into tissues during short exposure duration (1 h). When the dwell time was extended to 3 h, the systems showed a 2.7-fold increase in the ALA concentration in the bladder wall. Images of confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated a higher and deeper fluorescence signal, with emulsion administration, as compared to the aqueous control. Intravesical emulsion delivery provides a significant advantage for drugs targeting bladder tissues.",M2
19913351,"Transurethral resection of non-muscle-invasive bladder transitional cell cancers with or without 5-aminolevulinic Acid under visible and fluorescent light: results of a prospective, randomised, multicentre study.BACKGROUND: Fluorescent light (FL)-guided cystoscopy induced by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) has been reported to detect more tumours compared with standard white-light (WL) cystoscopy. Most reports are from single centres with relatively few patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether 5-ALA-induced FL and WL cystoscopy at transurethral resection (TUR) is superior compared with standard procedures under WL only with respect to tumour recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomised, multicentre, observer- and pathologist-blinded, prospective phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 300 patients, and of those patients, 153 were randomised to FL cystoscopy and 147 were randomised to standard WL cystoscopy. INTERVENTION: All patients were first inspected under WL and all lesions were recorded. Patients randomised to FL underwent a second inspection. TUR was carried out in both groups. MEASUREMENTS: Control cystoscopy under WL was performed in all patients every 3 mo during the first year after randomisation and biannually thereafter. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At the first TUR, the mean number of resection specimens per patient was 2.5 (FL: 2.5; WL: 2.4; p=0.37) and the resulting mean number of resected tumours was 1.7 with FL and 1.8 with WL (p=0.85). More patients were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the WL group (13%) than in the FL group (4.2%). Within-patient comparison of FL patients only showed that FL detected more lesions than WL. Tumour lesions solely detected by FL cystoscopy that would not otherwise be detected by WL cystoscopy included 52% dysplasia, 33% CIS, 18% papillary neoplasms, 13% pT1, and 7% pTa. Outcome at 12 mo did not show any difference between groups with regard to recurrence-free and progression-free survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective, randomised, multi-institutional study, we found no clinical advantage of FL cystoscopy compared with WL cystoscopy and TUR.",M2
19906163,"Evaluation of photodynamic therapy using topical aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in the treatment of condylomata acuminata: a comparative, randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical application of 20% wt/vol aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (<e>ALA</e>) in the treatment of condylomata acuminata (CA). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with CA were randomly allocated into the ALA-PDT group and the CO(2) laser group in an allocation ratio of 3 : 1. The treatment was repeated weekly if necessary, but no more than 3 times. The primary efficacy endpoint was the wart clearance rate 1 week after the last treatment. The recurrence rate was evaluated at weeks 4, 8 and 12 after the treatment ended. The clinical response to therapy and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients with CA were enrolled in the clinical trial. Of these 90 (98.9%) patients completed the trial (67 in the ALA-PDT group, and 23 in CO(2) laser group). By 1 week after the last treatment, the complete clearance rate was 95.93% in the ALA-PDT group and 100% in CO(2) laser group (P&gt;0.05). The clearance rate of CA at male urethral orifice was 100% in the ALA-PDT group and 100% in the CO(2) laser group (P&gt;0.05). The overall recurrence rate calculated by the end of the entire follow-up period was significantly lower in the ALA-PDT group than that in the CO(2) laser group (9.38% vs 17.39%, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, there was no systemic adverse event in either group. The proportion of patients with adverse effects in the ALA-PDT group (8.82%) was also significantly lower than that in the CO(2) laser group (100%, P&lt;0.05). The side-effects in patients treated with ALA-PDT mainly included mild burning and/or stinging restricted to the illuminated area. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed that topical application of ALA-PDT is a simpler and as effective therapy with a lower incidence of adverse effects in the treatment of CA compared with conventional CO(2) laser therapy.",M2
19905984,"Enhancement of 5-Aminolevulinic acid-induced oxidative stress on two cancer cell lines by gold nanoparticles.5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) and its methyl ester (5-ALA-Me) at mM concentration levels induce oxidative stress via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and HepG2) incubated in the dark in the simultaneous presence of 5.0 mM or more 5-ALA or 5-ALA-Me (for MCF-7) and 7 microg/mL of 15 nm citrate capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were damaged more seriously compared to those in the presence of the levulinic acid alone. Damage is visible in electron micrographs which reveal similar morphology both in the presence or absence of AuNPs. Cytotoxicity was observed irrespective of the presence of serum and medium. Production of ROS in cell free samples containing 5-ALA-Me was monitored by EPR as the DMPO-OH spin adduct and also showed a catalytic effect of AuNPs. Both SOD and CAT inhibited the production of ROS and also reduced cytotoxicity in the cell samples. These observations can be explained by initial attack on the cell membrane by ROS produced in the medium outside the cell and provide insight into possible uses of 5-ALA in cancer chemotherapy.",M2
19885588,"Effect of 5-<e>ALA</e>-PDT on VEGF and PCNA expression in human NPC-bearing nude mice.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, recurrence and metastasis of the tumor after PDT remains problematic. In this study we investigated VEGF and PCNA expression in tumor tissues after 5-ALA-PDT. BALB/c nude mice with NPC tumors of similar size were randomly assigned to three groups (n=10 each). In the two treatment groups, mice were administrated 5-ALA intratumorally at a dose of 100 mg/kg and 3-3.5 h prior to laser irradiation (630 nm, 100 J/cm(2), 100 mW/cm(2)). The mice in one of the treatment groups were sacrificed at 24 h after PDT. The other treatment group and control group mice were sacrificed 14 days after PDT, and the tumor weights were determined for all three groups. Mean tumor weights at 14 days after PDT were 1.353+/-0.204 g in the treatment group and 3.124+/-0.380 g in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Results showed the VEGF level in tumor tissues at 24 h after PDT was slightly higher than that in the control group, while it was down-regulated at 14 days after PDT. The PCNA level was not significantly different in tumor tissues among the three groups, but it was lower in degenerated tumor cells 24 h after PDT. Our results suggest that VEGF may play a role in tumor recurrence and metastasis following PDT. Residual tumor cells escaped from PDT is the main reason for tumor recurrence.",M2
19863513,"Skin cancer: preventive photodynamic therapy in patients with face and scalp cancerization. A randomized placebo-controlled study.Background Patients with a previous medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) often develop multiple or recurrent malignant lesions around the site of the primary tumour. This finding led to the field cancerization theory, which suggests that the entire epithelial surface of the regional skin has an increased risk for the development of malignant lesions. Management of field change is challenging, taking into account the high impact of NMSCs on public health and healthcare costs. Objectives We sought to investigate whether field-photodynamic therapy (PDT) of extreme photodamaged skin would prevent new NMSCs, in comparison with a control area receiving placebo-PDT, in patients with clinical and histological signs of field cancerization. Methods Forty-five patients, previously diagnosed as having NMSCs of the face or scalp, with actinic keratoses symmetrically distributed over the same regions, were randomized for field treatment with 20% aminolaevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-PDT on one side and placebo-PDT on the other. During the next 12-month period of follow up, patients were clinically evaluated for new NMSCs. Results A significant delay in the mean time of appearance and a reduction in the total number of new lesions were observed in the field-PDT protocol, when compared with the control. Conclusions The results obtained showed that field therapy with ALA-PDT confers a significant preventive potential against the formation of new NMSCs in patients with field changes.",M2
19851060,"The effect of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy on microcomedones and macrocomedones.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) has been shown to be an effective treatment for acne. However, the effect of ALA PDT on comedo formation has never been objectively evaluated. Cyanoacrylate follicular biopsy (CFB), a noninvasive procedure, has been proposed as the most reliable tool for studying follicular casts. OBJECTIVE: To determine the possible effect of ALA and red light (550-700 nm) on macro- and microcomedones in acne patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 10 patients with mild-to-moderate facial and/or chest/back acne resistant to conventional therapies received ALA PDT at 2-week intervals in 3 sessions. The severity of acne had been estimated by a system of points, the Global Acne Grading System. The patients underwent PDT utilizing ALA 10% (face) or 15% (back/chest) and red light (15 J/cm(2) each session). CFBs were performed. RESULTS: Four weeks after their last PDT session, the patients showed an average global score reduction of 50%. CFBs demonstrated a reduction in the total area, the average area and the density of macrocomedones. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study using CFB evaluation demonstrate that ALA PDT exerts an action on the comedogenic phase as well.",M2
19849812,"Inactivation of food pathogen Bacillus cereus by photosensitization in vitro and on the surface of packaging material.AIMS: The study was focused on the possibility to inactivate food pathogen Bacillus cereus by 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) - based photosensitization in vitro and after adhesion on the surface of packaging material. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus cereus was incubated with ALA (3-7.5 mmol l(-1)) for 5-60 min in different environment (PBS, packaging material and wheat grains) and afterwards illuminated with visible light. The light source used for illumination emitted light at lambda = 400 nm with energy density at the position of the cells, 20 mW cm(-2). The illumination time varied from 0 to 20 min, and subsequently a total energy dose was between 0 and 24 J cm(-2). The obtained results indicate that B. cereus after the incubation with 3-7.5 mmol l(-1) ALA produces suitable amounts of endogenous photosensitizers. Following illumination, micro-organism inactivated even by 6.3 log. The inactivation of B. cereus after adhesion on the surface of food packaging by photosensitization reached 4 log. It is important to note that spores of B. cereus were susceptible to this treatment as well; 3.7-log inactivation in vitro and 2.7-log inactivation on the surface of packaging material were achieved at certain experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetative cells and spores of Gram-positive food pathogen B. cereus were effectively inactivated by ALA-based photosensitization in vitro. Moreover, the significant inactivation of B. cereus adhered on the surface of packaging material was observed. It was shown that photosensitization-based inactivation of B. cereus depended on the total light dose (illumination time) as well as on the amount of endogenous porphyrins (initial ALA concentration, time of incubation with ALA). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our previous data, as well as the one obtained in this study, support the idea that photosensitization with its high selectivity, antimicrobial efficiency and nonthermal nature could serve in the future for the development of completely safe, nonthermal surface decontamination and food preservation techniques.",M2
19848315,"5-aminolaevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy for the treatment of cervical condylomata acuminata.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) on cervical condylomata acuminata. METHODS: Patients with cervical condylomata (n=30) were allocated into primary and recurrent group, and were given topical ALA under occlusive dressing for 3 hours followed by irradiation with semiconductor laser at a dose of 100 Jcm(-2) and a power of 100 mW. The treatment was repeated 7 days later if the lesion was not completely removed after the first treatment. Complete response rate and recurrence rate of wart lesions as well as rate of adverse reaction were analyzed. RESULTS: The total complete response rate of PDT was 100% and the total recurrence rate was 5% after 3 months of follow-up. Recurrence rate of recurrent group was significantly lower than that of prior managements (100%, P&lt;0.01). The side effects of PDT in patients mainly included mild burning and/or stinging restricted to the illuminated areas, and was significant lower than their own control (25% vs. 100%, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional therapies, topical application of ALA-PDT is a simple, effective, safe, well-tolerated, and low recurrence rate treatment for cervical condylomata acuminata.",M2
19824459,"[Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of PDD, colposcopy and cytology in the detection of cervical neoplastic lesions]OBJECTIVES: Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is based on the phenomenon of selective accumulation of a photosensitizer in the tissues where carcinogenesis has started. The change may be identified by fluorescence which takes place when a photosensitizer is activated by the light of an appropriate wave length. The aim of this study was: 1. Evaluation of photodynamic diagnosis in detection and precise location of cervical neoplastic lesions. 2. Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of PDD, colposcopy and cytology in detection of cervical neoplastic lesions. MATERIAL: The study was carried out between October 2006 and December 2007 and included 73 women, patients of Gynecologic Oncology Division of the Poznan University of Medical Sciences Hospital. The examined patients were divided into two groups: the first consisted of 43 women with neoplastic lesions and the second, consisting of 30 patients with no oncologic changes of uterine cervix, comprised the control group. METHODS: Each patient had PDD, cytological smear and colposcopy performed. For PDD 3% 5-delta-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) gel was used as a photosensitizer, applied on cervical surface 4 hours before the examination. To activate fluorescence of the areas with highest accumulation of the photosensitizer the cervix was exposed to the light of 405 nm wave length. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1. Photodynamic diagnosis with 3% 5-ALA enables the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with higher sensitivity than colposcopy and higher specificity than cytological diagnosis. 2. Fluorescence allows for precise location of a cervical neoplastic change as well as its extension, borders or multifocal character. 3. Location of the change indicated by fluorescence may facilitate the choice of the place for direct biopsy as well as the extension of the therapy.",M2
19819538,"Hexaminolevulinate is equal to 5-aminolevulinic acid concerning residual tumor and recurrence rate following photodynamic diagnostic assisted transurethral resection of bladder tumors.OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) vs hexaminolaevulinate (HEX) vs white light (WL) transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURB) to assess transferability of ALA findings to HEX. Extending WL-TURB with photodynamic diagnostic improves outcome. Two fluorescent agents have been commonly used for this. Although numerous and specific data exist on the older substance ALA, considerably less are available on hex, the only agent approved however. To date no such report has been published. METHODS: By random generator, each 200 patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer having undergone TURB with WL, ALA or HEX were selected from our institutional data bank. Residual tumor in control TURB (RT) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed. RESULTS: Complete follow-up data were available on 142 WL, 139 ALA, and 135 HEX patients. Median duration of follow-up was 24 months. RT was 33% in WL, 15% in ALA, and 9% in hex, respectively. RFS at 3 years was 67% in WL, 80% in ALA, and 82% in hex, respectively. RT was significantly reduced in ALA and HEX vs WL (P &lt; .001) and RFS prolonged (P &lt; .01). There were no significant differences between ALA and HEX in RT and RFS, respectively (RT: P = .37; RFS: P = .72). CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective series, ALA and HEX were found to be significantly superior to WL. No differences between ALA and HEX were demonstrated. Even from a careful perspective both fluorescent agents seem to be comparable. Thus, ALA-based findings seem to be transferable on the approved agent HEX.",M2
19816916,"Comparison of clinical outcomes of oral erythroleukoplakia treated with photodynamic therapy using either light-emitting diode or laser light.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (topical <e>ALA</e>-PDT) using a 635-nm light-emitting diode (LED) light is an effective treatment modality for oral verrucous hyperplasia. This study tested whether topical ALA-PDT using either the LED or laser light was also an effective treatment modality for oral erythroleukoplakia (OEL) lesions. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective but non-randomized study, 20 OEL lesions were treated with topical ALA-PDT using the 635-nm LED light and 26 OEL lesions were treated with topical ALA-PDT using the 635-nm laser light. The difference in clinical outcomes was compared between the two groups by Fisher exact test. RESULTS: We found that the 20 LED light-treated OEL lesions showed complete response (CR) in 17 and partial response (PR) in 3. The 17 CR OEL lesions required an average of 3.7 (range, 2-7) treatments of ALA-PDT to achieve CR of the lesions. The 26 laser light-treated OEL lesions showed CR in 25 and PR in 1. The 25 CR OEL lesions needed an average of 3.3 (range, 2-6) treatments of ALA-PDT to achieve CR of the lesions. There was no significant difference in PDT outcomes between the 20 LED light-treated and 26 laser light-treated OEL lesions (P = 0.303). When the 42 CR OEL lesions were pooled together, we found that smaller lesions (greatest diameter &lt;1.5 cm) and lesions with thinner surface keratin (keratin layer &lt; or =30 microm) needed significantly fewer mean treatment number of PDT to achieve a CR than the larger lesions (P = 0.000) and lesions with thicker surface keratin (P = 0.000), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topical ALA-PDT using either the LED or laser light is an effective treatment modality for OEL lesions. There is no significant difference in clinical outcomes of OEL lesions treated with PDT using either the LED or laser light.",M2
19804593,"Long-term follow-up of photodynamic therapy with a self-adhesive 5-aminolaevulinic acid patch: 12 months data.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy with a self-adhesive 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) patch shows high efficacy rates in the treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) in short term trials. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the trial was to follow up patients after successful 5-ALA patch-PDT at 3 month intervals over a total period of 12 months. Patients who had received placebo-PDT or cryosurgery served for comparison. PATIENTS/METHODS: Three months after therapy, 360 patients from two separate randomized parallel group phase III studies (one superiority trial vs. placebo-PDT, one noninferiority trial vs. cryosurgery) were suitable for the follow-up study. Patients had to show at least one successfully treated AK lesion after initial therapy. A total of 316 patients completed the follow-up. RESULTS: Twelve months after a single treatment, 5-ALA patch-PDT still proved superior to placebo-PDT and cryosurgery (P &lt; 0.001 for all tests). On a lesion basis, efficacy rates were 63% and 79% for PDT, 63% for cryosurgery and 9% and 25% for placebo-PDT. Recurrence rates of patch-PDT proved superior to those of cryosurgery (per protocol set: P = 0.011, full analysis set: P = 0.049). While 31% of cryosurgery lesions were still hypopigmented after 1 year, the 5-ALA patch-PDT groups showed hypopigmentation in 0% (superiority trial) and 3% (noninferiority trial) of the treated lesions. CONCLUSION: Twelve months after a single 5-ALA patch-PDT the majority of lesions were still cleared with an excellent cosmetic outcome. 5-ALA patch-PDT proved to be superior to cryosurgery in the noninferiority study setting.",M2
19802891,"Simulations of measured photobleaching kinetics in human basal cell carcinomas suggest blood flow reductions during <e>ALA</e>-PDT.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In a recently completed pilot clinical study at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, patients with superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) received topical application of 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and were irradiated with 633 nm light at 10-150 mW cm(-2). Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photobleaching in the lesion and the adjacent perilesion normal margin was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. In most cases, the rate of bleaching slowed as treatment progressed, leaving a fraction of the PpIX unbleached despite sustained irradiation. To account for this feature, we hypothesized a decrease in blood flow during ALA-photodynamic therapy (PDT) that reduced the rate of oxygen transported to the tissue and therefore attenuated the photobleaching process. We have performed a detailed analysis of this hypothesis. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a comprehensive, previously published mathematical model to simulate the effects of therapy-induced blood flow reduction on the measured PpIX photobleaching. This mathematical model of PDT in vivo incorporates a singlet-oxygen-mediated photobleaching mechanism, dynamic unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, and provides for blood flow velocity changes. It permits simulation of the in vivo photobleaching of PpIX in this patient population over the full range of irradiances and fluences. RESULTS: The results suggest that the physiological equivalent of discrete blood flow reductions is necessary to simulate successfully the features of the bleaching data over the entire treatment fluence regime. Furthermore, the magnitude of the blood flow changes in the normal tissue margin and lesion for a wide range of irradiances is consistent with a nitric-oxide-mediated mechanism of vasoconstriction. CONCLUSION: A detailed numerical study using a comprehensive PDT dosimetry model is consistent with the hypothesis that the observed trends in the in vivo PpIX photobleaching data from patients may be explained on the basis of therapy-induced blood flow reductions at specific fluences.",M2
19795168,"Photoinactivation of Candida albicans by its own endogenous porphyrins.The possibility of photoeradicating the prokaryotic microorganism Candida albicans by enhancing its endogenous porphyrin production and accumulation was investigated in this study. Induction of porphyrin synthesis was performed by the addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>), or its hydrophobic derivative ALA methyl ester (m-ALA). Photoinactivation of C. albicans was performed under blue light (407-420 nm) illumination. A decrease in viability of about 1.6 or 2.1 orders of magnitudes was obtained with a light dose of 36 J/cm(2) for an initial concentration of 100-mg/ml ALA or m-ALA, respectively. Endogenous porphyrins extracted from the cells showed that cultures incubated with m-ALA accumulated a relatively higher amount of endogenous porphyrins than ALA, indicating better transport through the yeast cell barriers. When a combination of miconazole and ketoconazole (antifungal agents) is given at a sub-inhibitory concentration (0.5 microg/ml each) with an inducer, a 2.1 or 3.2 orders of magnitude decrease in viability is caused with ALA or with m-ALA, respectively, upon illumination. Fluorescence intensities of the accumulated porphyrins as demonstrated by FACS indicate that the combination of the two azole drugs and an inducer cause a relatively high amount of endogenous porphyrins. Although the additive action of both azole drugs allow better penetration of the inducer, especially m-ALA photoeradication remained limited because of an acidic pH generated in the presence of the inducer. The acidic pH is probably the cause for the inefficiency of the photodynamic treatment. More hydrophobic inducers than m-ALA and less acidic must be investigated to improve the photodynamic treatment by endogenous-induced porphyrins.",M2
19789817,"Silencing of <e>ALA</e> dehydratase affects ALA-photodynamic therapy efficacy in K562 erythroleukemic cells.Synthesis of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) by malignant cells is essential for the success of ALA-based photodynamic therapy (PDT). Two key enzymes that were described as affecting PpIX accumulation during ALA treatment are porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) and ferrochelatase. Here, we show that down regulation of ALA dehydratase (ALAD) expression and activity by specific shRNA induced a marked decrease in PpIX synthesis in K562 erythroleukemic cells. Photo-inactivation efficacy following ALA-PDT was directly correlated with ALAD-silencing and cellular levels of PpIX. MTT metabolism following ALA-PDT was shown to be 60% higher in ALAD-silenced cells in comparison to control cells, indicating that mitochondria were protected in the silenced cells. Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of cells treated by ALA-PDT showed no morphological changes in ALAD-silenced cells, in contrast to controls exhibiting cell deformations and lysis. Membrane integrity following ALA-PDT was kept intact and undamaged in ALAD-silenced cells as examined by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and LDH-L leakage. We conclude that ALAD, although it is present in the cell at abundant levels, has a major and limiting role in regulating PpIX synthesis and ALA-PDT outcome.",M2
19789362,"Transport of the photodynamic therapy agent 5-aminolevulinic acid by distinct H+-coupled nutrient carriers coexpressed in the small intestine.5-Aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is a prodrug used in photodynamic therapy, fluorescent diagnosis, and fluorescent-guided resection because it leads to accumulation of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in tumor tissues. ALA has good oral bioavailability, but high oral doses are required to obtain selective PpIX accumulation in colonic tumors because accumulation is also observed in normal gut mucosa. Structural similarities between ALA and GABA led us to test the hypothesis that the H(+)-coupled amino acid transporter PAT1 (SLC36A1) will contribute to luminal ALA uptake. Radiolabel uptake and electrophysiological measurements identified PAT1-mediated H(+)-coupled ALA symport after heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. The selectivity of the nontransported inhibitors 5-hydroxytryptophan and 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid for, respectively, PAT1 and the H(+)-coupled di/tripeptide transporter PepT1 (SLC15A1) were examined. 5-Hydroxytryptophan selectively inhibited PAT1-mediated amino acid uptake across the brush-border membrane of the human intestinal (Caco-2) epithelium whereas 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid selectively inhibited PepT1-mediated dipeptide uptake. The inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 4-aminomethylbenzoic acid were additive, demonstrating that both PAT1 and PepT1 contribute to intestinal transport of ALA. This is the first demonstration of overlap in substrate specificity between these distinct transporters for amino acids and dipeptides. PAT1 and PepT1 expression was monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using paired samples of normal and cancer tissue from human colon. mRNA for both transporters was detected. PepT1 mRNA was increased 2.3-fold in cancer tissues. Thus, increased PepT1 expression in colonic cancer could contribute to the increased PpIX accumulation observed. Selective inhibition of PAT1 could enhance PpIX loading in tumor tissue relative to that in normal tissue.",M2
19785604,"Topical aminolaevulinic acid- and aminolaevulinic acid methyl ester-based photodynamic therapy with red and violet light: influence of wavelength on pain and erythema.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the combination of an exogenously administered precursor of photosensitizer [protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)] synthesis and exposure to light. Choosing the optimal wavelength is important. Red light penetrates deeper into tissue, while violet light is more efficient in activating PpIX but does not penetrate so deeply. OBJECTIVES: We studied PpIX formation and the PDT effect after application to human skin of creams containing aminolaevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and aminolaevulinic acid methyl ester (MAL). The aim of the study was to investigate whether the wavelength of the light used has an influence on pain sensations during topical PDT with the different prodrugs. METHODS: ALA cream (10%) and MAL cream (10%) were topically applied on the skin of 10 healthy volunteers. After 24 h the application site was exposed to 8 mW cm(-2) violet laser or to 100 mW cm(-2) red laser light. The erythema index was monitored up to 24 h after light exposure. For the first time the pain during topical ALA- and MAL-PDT was assessed by measuring the time taken for pain to occur. Also, for the first time, the intensities of the light sources were calibrated so as to have the same relative quantum efficiency. Results The pain sensation during ALA-PDT with red light came 22 s sooner than during ALA-PDT with violet light, which is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, ALA-PDT with red light gave stronger and more persistent erythema than ALA-PDT with violet light. ALA induced about three times more PpIX than MAL. No statistically significant differences were found for erythema, or for the time for pain to occur, in the case of MAL-PDT with red vs. violet light. CONCLUSIONS: Topical ALA-PDT with violet light allows longer exposure times before pain is induced and gives less erythema as compared with topical ALA-PDT with red light.",M2

19755440,"Time-dependent changes in lead and delta-aminolevulinic acid after subchronic lead exposure in rats.The time-dependent changes in lead (Pb) concentrations in major tissues, serum and urine, and the Pb biomarker delta-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) concentration in urine were studied in rats after sub-chronic Pb exposure. Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to Pb in drinking water at concentrations of 100 ppm and 1000 ppm for 30 days. The Pb concentration in muscle, liver, kidney, plasma and urine, and the ALA concentration in urine were determined during exposure and every 7 days after exposure for 3 weeks. The muscle Pb concentration did not change post exposure. The liver Pb concentration increased 2.2 to 2.8 times (100 ppm group) and 3.9 to 7.4 times (1000 ppm group) during exposure, then decreased rapidly. Kidney Pb concentrations were 8.0 to 14.3 times (100 ppm group) and 13.8 to 28.5 times (1000 ppm group) higher than controls during exposure and decreased for 1 to 2 weeks post exposure. Plasma Pb concentrations were 1.2 to 3.3 times (100 ppm group) and 2.9 to 5.8 times (1000 ppm group) higher than control concentrations during exposure and decreased time-dependently in the 1000-ppm group after exposure. Urine Pb concentrations were 8.5 to 10.7 times (100 ppm group) and 30.4 to 51.1 times (1000 ppm group) higher than control concentrations during exposure and rapidly decreased after exposure, though concentrations remained up to 4 times higher than controls in the 1000 ppm exposure group. Urine ALA concentrations increased 1.7 to 2.6 and 7.1 to 32.7 times during exposure in the 100 ppm and 1000 ppm groups respectively, and remained elevated for 21 days post exposure. Our data support that urine Pb concentration is a useful marker for acute Pb exposure or post exposure. Urine ALA may be a predicator of biological response to Pb exposure.",M2
19747250,"Photodynamic therapy using direct-current pulsed iontophoresis for 5-aminolevulinic acid application.In photodynamic therapy (PDT) for skin cancer, 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is applied topically to the affected area to be absorbed percutaneously through passive diffusion, and typically requires 4-6 h before performing PDT. In this study, we attempted to reduce the absorption period in PDT by ionizing ALA using direct-current pulsed iontophoresis to treat actinic keratosis (AK). Twenty percent ALA solution was applied to AK lesions of five patients using direct-current pulsed iontophoresis. ALA-PDT was repeated three times with a total irradiation of 150 J/cm(2) (50 J/cm(2) per irradiation, weekly). One week after the last PDT, therapeutic results were assessed by skin biopsy. In all subjects, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production was confirmed after iontophoresis, and its production levels were comparable to the conventional occlusive dressing technique (ODT). Skin biopsies from the treated lesion showed the disappearance of tumour cells. These results indicated that direct-current pulsed iontophoresis for applying ALA before PDT is useful to treat AK.",M2
19747247,"Phototoxic reactions in healthy volunteers following photodynamic therapy with methylaminolevulinate cream or with cream containing 5-aminolevulinic acid: a phase II, randomized study.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the selective destruction of abnormal cells through activation of a photosensitizer in the presence of oxygen. Local phototoxic reactions and pain are the most common limiting side effects. PURPOSE: The primary objective was to compare the local phototoxic response following PDT with methylaminolevulinate (MAL) and 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>). The secondary objectives were to compare the two treatments regarding pain, detection of substance P, change in fluorescence intensity from before to 5 h after cream application and adverse events not related to local phototoxicity. METHODS: Thirty-four healthy volunteers were treated by PDT using MAL 160 mg/g cream and ALA cream 20% randomly assigned to treatment areas on the inside of each upper arm. A composite score of local phototoxic events (erythema, edema, hyperpigmentation) was calculated. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) analysis of composite scores showed a significantly higher AUC for ALA-PDT (P &lt; or =0.0001). ALA- and MAL-PDT showed equivalent local side-effect frequencies, except for a higher frequency of hyperpigmentation after 28 d using ALA-PDT (P=0.006).

19735078,"Mechanism of cell death by 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic action and its enhancement by ferrochelatase inhibitors in human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for tumors is based on the tumor-selective accumulation of a photosensitizer, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), followed by irradiation with visible light. However, the molecular mechanism of cell death caused by PDT has not been fully elucidated. The 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-based photodynamic action (PDA) was dependent on the accumulation of PpIX, the level of which decreased rapidly by eliminating ALA from the incubation medium in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells. PDA induced apoptosis characterized by lipid peroxidation, increase in Bak and Bax/Bcl-xL, decrease in Bid, membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. PDT-induced cell death seemed to occur predominantly via apoptosis through distribution of PpIX in mitochondria. These cell death events were enhanced by ferrochelatase inhibitors. These results indicated that ALA-based-PDA induced apoptotic cell death through a mitochondrial pathway and that ferrochelatase inhibitors might enhanced the effect of PDT for tumors even at low concentrations of ALA.",M2
19731298,"The effects of ultra low fluence rate single and repetitive photodynamic therapy on glioma spheroids.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Achieving local control of gliomas with photodynamic therapy (PDT) requires the delivery of adequate light fluences to depths of 1-2 cm in the resection margin where the majority of local recurrences originate. This is clinically impractical with current single-shot, intraoperative PDT treatments due to the length of time required to deliver adequate fluences. Multiple or extended treatment protocols would therefore seem to be required. The response of human glioma spheroids to 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-mediated PDT using single or, repetitive light delivery protocols was investigated at both low and ultra low fluence rates. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human glioma spheroids (400 microm diameter) were subjected to sub-threshold light fluence (1.5, 3, or 6 J cm(-2)) ALA-PDT consisting of four light delivery schemes: single treatment given over either 1 or 24 hours, repetitive treatment given either as four 1 hour light treatments separated by a 4 day interval, or 24 hours light delivery, consisting of four 24 hours treatments separated by a 3 day interval. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using a growth assay. In some cases, confocal microscopy was used to image cell viability. RESULTS: The repetitive and single light treatment protocols were most effective when delivered at ultra low (microW cm(-2)) fluence rates. In all cases, growth inhibition was light dose-dependent. The repetitive ultra low fluence rate treatment (1.5 J cm(-2); irradiance = 17 microW cm(-2)) light delivery protocol was the most effective resulting in total growth inhibition during the 2-week observation period. CONCLUSION: Ultra low light fluence rate ALA-PDT results in significant spheroid growth inhibition. Repeated administration of ALA was required during repetitive and/or protracted single PDT treatment protocols. The existence of a lower fluence rate limit, below which the efficacy of threshold light fluences diminish was not found in these studies. Lasers Surg. Med. 41:578-584, 2009.

Fluorescence emission spectra were measured under 410 nm excitation. Generally, the most intense fluorescence emission peaks occurred at 460 and 630 nm. The ratios of the area under red peak (630+/-10 nm) to the area under blue peak (460+/-10 nm), denoted as RB, were calculated. We found that OSF mucosa has the lowest RB value, followed by NOM, EH on OSF, and ED on OSF. An ANOVA test showed significant differences between OSF, NOM, EH on OSF, and ED on OSF (p&lt;0.05). However, measurements of autofluorescence (i.e., before ALA application) show no significant differences between OSF, NOM, EH on OSF, and ED on OSF (ANOVA test, p&gt;0.05). These results indicate that ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to identify the premalignant lesions on oral fibrotic mucosa, which could not be found by autofluorescence.",M2
19720133,"Photodynamic properties of ZnTPPS(4), ClAlPcS(2) and <e>ALA</e> in human melanoma G361 cells.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved as proper and effective kind of treatment for certain types of cancer and non-malignant diseases. We tested photodynamic effects on G361 human melanoma cells sensitized by zinc-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulphonatophenyl) porphyrine (ZnTPPS(4)), chloraluminium phtalocyanine disulfonate (ClAlPcS(2)) and 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In particular, we examined the PDT efficiency depending on applied light dose (0.8; 1.7; 3.3; 6.6; 13.2; 26.4Jcm(-2)). The DNA gel electrophoresis, methylthiazol tetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability test, fluorescent microscopy using calcein AM and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and rhodamine 123 mitochondrial membrane potential assay were performed to detect and evaluate the cell death process. We also measured the time course of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and its dependence on sensitizer concentration within continuously irradiated sensitized cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate most significant phototoxic effect of ClAlPcS(2)-PDT in spite of significantly higher ROS production induced by ZnTPPS(4)-PDT on G361 cells. On the other hand, ALA-PDT has a minimal photoeffect and induces negligible ROS formation in G361 cells at the conditions described below.",M2

19708873,"A comparative study of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid incubation times in photodynamic therapy with intense pulsed light for the treatment of inflammatory acne.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is used for effective treatment of facial acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVES: To determine which of two different incubation times (30 minutes and 3 hours) is more effective in PDT with intense pulsed light (IPL) for acne vulgaris. METHODS &amp; MATERIALS: Twenty Korean subjects with moderate to severe acne were enrolled for a randomized, half-facial treatment study. Three sessions with short incubation with ALA plus IPL (30 minutes, n=9) or long incubation with ALA plus IPL (3 hours, n=11) on one side of the face and IPL alone on the other side were performed at 1-month intervals. RESULTS: All subjects showed improvement in inflammatory acne lesions after three sessions of ALA-PDT or IPL alone (p&lt;.001 in all groups). The degree of improvement in inflammatory acne lesions was greater in the long incubation time group than the short incubation time group or the IPL-alone group, although the mean reduction of inflammatory acne lesions was statistically different only between the long incubation group and the IPL-only group (p=.01). There were no statistical differences between the short incubation group and IPL-alone group. All three groups had decreased sebum secretion after three sessions (p&lt;.001 in all groups), but the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Only transient erythema and mild edema were reported for all treatment groups. CONCLUSION: PDT with a long ALA incubation time might be more adequate for a pronounced outcome with inflammatory acne.",M2
19705180,"Desferrioxamine shows different potentials for enhancing 5-aminolaevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy in several cutaneous cell lines.Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is the photosensitizer in 5-aminolaevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT). Its further bioconversion to heme requires iron and can be suppressed by iron chelators such as desferrioxamine (DFO). To investigate the effectiveness of DFO in enhancing PpIX-based PDT in skin tissue, we selected fibroblasts, HaCat cells and Hep-2 cells as targets co-cultured with ALA, that have different biological characteristics for PpIX conversion. Evaluated interventions included: (1) blank control (no ALA, no DFO); (2) DFO alone; (3) ALA alone; and (4) DFO in combination with ALA. Before photodynamic irradiation, cellular PpIX level and fluorescence were measured. After irradiation, cell death ratio was calculated and morphological changes in the cells were observed. The results showed that the content and photodynamic effects of cellular PpIX presented in the order Hep-2 cells &gt; HaCat cells &gt; fibroblasts, either co-cultured with ALA alone or with ALA plus DFO. DFO was found to have increasing effects on both PpIX level and cell death ratio in the same order. It was found that DFO had different potentials for augmenting ALA-PDT in these cutaneous cell lines. The cells proliferating more rapidly might be more susceptible to enhancement of DFO.",M2
19703361,"Aminolevulinic acid-loaded Witepsol microparticles manufactured using a spray congealing procedure: implications for topical photodynamic therapy.OBJECTIVES: The aim was to enhance aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) stability by incorporation into low-melting microparticles prepared using a spray congealing procedure and to evaluate temperature-triggered release, allowing topical bioavailability following melting at skin temperature. METHODS: ALA-loaded Witepsol microparticles were prepared using a novel spray congealing technique. Entrapment efficiency was compared with conventional emulsion-based methods and modelled drug release profiles determined using a membrane separation technique. Raised receiver medium temperature was used to determine triggered release. Bioavailability and lipid-mediated enhancement of ALA penetration were determined in excised murine skin. KEY FINDINGS: ALA-loaded Witepsol microparticles were spherical, with a mean diameter of 20 mum. Loading and stability studies demonstrated effective encapsulation, ranging from 91% to 100%, with no evidence of degradation to pyrazine derivatives. ALA release correlated with dissolution medium temperature, triggered at temperatures close to that of skin. Results suggested that molten Witepsol enhanced cutaneous permeation, whereas incorporation of microparticles in a semi-solid vehicle attenuated ALA penetration. Optimal use was direct application under occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Spray congealing is superior to the emulsion-based procedures with respect to encapsulation efficiency of ALA in Witepsol matrices, providing temperature-triggered release, enhanced stability and improved penetration of ALA through keratinised skin. These features could improve ALA delivery to superficial lesions as part of photodynamic therapy.",M2
19681999,"Enhanced efficacy of photodynamic therapy with methyl 5-aminolevulinic acid in recalcitrant periungual warts after ablative carbon dioxide fractional laser: a pilot study.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) has been used to improve recalcitrant periungual warts, but most lesions achieved complete remission after more than four sessions, and some lesions did not respond to the method. In this pilot study, the potential for synergistic effects of the combination of ablative carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fractional laser and methyl 5-ALA (MAL)-PDT for the treatment of recalcitrant periungual warts was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve Korean patients (8 women and 4 men aged 20-45, mean age 27.9) with a total of 40 periungual warts were enrolled in the present study. The lesions were treated using an ablative CO(2) fractional laser. Immediately after each fractional treatment, MAL was applied on the periungual warts, and 3 hours later, such areas were illuminated with a red light at a dose of 50 J/cm(2) for 15 minutes. RESULTS: After a mean of 2.2 treatments per wart, a mean clearance of 100% was achieved in 36 (90%) warts. Two warts (5%) had 50% clearance, and two (5%) showed no response after three treatments. There were no recurrences of the warts that had achieved 100% clearance during the follow-up period of 6 months. Most of the treatments had no severe side effects during or after their administration. CONCLUSION&gt; A potential for enhanced clinical results when using combined ablative CO(2) fractional laser and MAL-PDT for the treatment of periungual warts was shown in this pilot study.",M2

METHODS: Human laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells of the line Hep-2 cells were co-cultured with 2 mmol/L ALA (Group A) or without ALA (Group B) at the culturing temperature 19 - 46 degrees C. Three hours later cellular protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) level was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent detection. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to observe the fluorescent strength in the Hep-2 cells. The ratio of cell death (including necrosis and apoptosis) was detected with flow cytometer before and after photodynamic reaction. RESULTS: In Group A the PpIX level at the temperature of 19 degrees C was (0.25 +/- 0.06) microg/L, and raised to (1.07 +/- 0.11) microg/L at 46 degrees C. There was no cellular PpIX detected in Group B at any temperature. Before laser radiation the cell death ratios of both groups were the same at the temperature 19 - 37 degrees C, and at the temperature 37 - 46 degrees C. After laser radiation the cell death ratio of Group A raised from 31.11% to 98.92% as the temperature went up steadily, but the results of Group B showed the same curve as before laser radiation. At any same temperatures the cell death ratios of Group A were all significantly higher than those of Group B (all P &lt; 0.05), and as the temperature was elevated the difference between the 2 groups raised from 28.99% to 59.26%. CONCLUSION: Moderate higher temperature enhances the PpIX production and photodynamic reaction in human laryngeal squamous carcinoma induced by ALA in vitro.",M2
19671025,"Hexyl aminolevulinate fluorescence cystoscopy in bladder cancer.Although bladder cancer occurs frequently, early diagnosis and complete removal of malignant lesions usually lead to good clinical outcomes. In the USA, white light cystoscopy (WLC) is commonly used for bladder cancer diagnosis and guidance of the surgical resection. However, with WLC malignant and precancerous lesions may be missed, resulting in a high rate of disease recurrence. Monitoring for and treating these recurrences carry high direct and indirect costs. Because hexyl aminolevulinate (HAL; 5-<e>ALA</e>-hexylester) fluorescence cystoscopy has greater sensitivity than WLC, especially for detecting early stage lesions, and its use provides more complete resection and lower disease recurrence, it has been recommended in European clinical guidelines. This article reports our own HAL experiences and first time recurrence data, describes how HAL was developed, provides key clinical trial results, and discusses how HAL, which has revolutionized fluorescence cystoscopy and bladder cancer care in Europe, may ultimately revolutionize bladder cancer care in the USA.",M2
19662485,"Ex vivo photodynamic diagnosis to detect malignant cells in oral brush biopsies.In this study we proved the efficiency of the fluorimetric detection of a minimum number of malignant cells ex vivo. The goal of this work was to investigate whether the combination of photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) with oral brush biopsy might become a suitable chair-side tool to detect early oral carcinoma. Small numbers (100-500) of established human tumour cells-small cell lung carcinoma (OAT 75), transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (SW1710) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293)-were incubated with 2 mM 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>). In addition, 50 brush biopsies from volunteers were prepared. After 2 h and 3 h of incubation, all samples were investigated by spectrofluorometry. Measurements were performed in capillaries. For excitation (405 nm) and detection of fluorescence spectra, a fibre microprobe-spectrofluorometer system (fibre 400 microm) was used. A minimum of 100 malignant cells and 3 h of incubation with ALA were needed to detect a typical spectrum for protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Some epithelial samples from brush biopsy showed strong (bacteria related) PPIX autofluorescence, which increased after the addition of 5-ALA. From the testing of various antibiotics and antiseptics it emerged that 0.4 mM chlorhexidine strongly reduced fluorescence in brush biopsies from healthy volunteers, whereas the fluorescence signal of established cancer cell lines decreased only a little. The experiments revealed that, by means of an optical microprobe, very few cancer cells (100) can be detected. The addition of chlorhexidine before the incubation of brush biopsies with 5-ALA increases the reliability of the test by largely reducing the autofluorescence signal due to the presence of bacteria. Chair-side diagnostics of epithelial carcinoma seem feasible.",M2
19660544,"Topical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid-encapsulated ethosomes in a hyperproliferative skin animal model using the CLSM technique to evaluate the penetration behavior.Psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disease, exhibits recurring itching, soreness, and cracked and bleeding skin. Currently, the topical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (<e>ALA</e>-PDT) is an optional treatment for psoriasis which provides long-term therapeutic effects, is non-toxic and enjoys better compliance with patients. However, the precursor of ALA is hydrophilic, and thus its ability to penetrate the skin is limited. Also, little research has provided a platform to investigate the penetration behavior in disordered skin. We employed a highly potent ethosomal carrier (phosphatidylethanolamine; PE) to investigate the penetration behavior of ALA and the recovery of skin in a hyperproliferative murine model. We found that the application of ethosomes produced a significant increase in cumulative amounts of 5-26-fold in normal and hyperproliferative murine skin samples when compared to an ALA aqueous solution; and the ALA aqueous solution appeared less precise in terms of the penetration mode in hyperproliferative murine skin. After the ethosomes had been applied, the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) intensity increased about 3.64-fold compared with that of the ALA aqueous solution, and the penetration depth reached 30-80 microm. The results demonstrated that the ethosomal carrier significantly improved the delivery of ALA and the formation of PpIX in both normal and hyperproliferative murine skin samples, and the expression level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was reduced after the ALA-ethosomes were applied to treat hyperproliferative murine skin. Furthermore, the results of present study encourage more investigations on the mechanism of the interaction with ethosomes and hyperproliferative murine skin.",M2
19648502,"Effects of delta-aminolevulinic acid and vitamin C supplementation on feed intake, backfat, and iron status in sows.This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary administered delta-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and vitamin C on the hematological profiles and performance of sows and sucking pigs and to determine if iron status could be improved by dietary administration of ALA. Seven days before parturition, 120 sows (Landrace x Yorkshire) were randomly assigned within parities to 1 of 4 dietary treatments. The lactation treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial with 2 ALA concentrations (0 or 10 mg/kg of feed, as fed) and 2 vitamin C concentrations (0 or 500 mg/kg of feed, as fed). After farrowing, daily feed allowance increased gradually, and sows had ad libitum access to feed by wk 2. Sows provided diets with ALA tended to consume more feed (P &lt; 0.10) than sows fed diets that did not contain ALA. Conversely, backfat losses were less in sows that received the diets with ALA compared with those received the nonsupplemented diets (P &lt; 0.05). Supplementation with ALA and vitamin C resulted in improved hematological profiles (total protein, albumin, and IgG) in sows (P &lt; 0.05). The iron status in the blood and milk were also improved by ALA supplementation (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the BW at weaning and the ADG during the sucking period increased in response to supplementation of ALA and vitamin C (P &lt; 0.05). The blood iron status of piglets was also improved by ALA supplementation (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of ALA can increase the blood iron status of sows and sucking pigs, as well as the iron transfer efficiency from sows to piglets through elevated milk iron concentrations.",M2
19648025,"Pharmacokinetic of <e>ALA</e> and h-ALA induced porphyrins in the models Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium smegmatis.Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacterial strains presents an attractive potential alternative to antibiotic therapies. Success is dependent on the effective accumulation in bacterial cells of photochemical substances called photosensitizers, which are usually porphyrins. It is also important to know the distribution of the photosensitizer in bacteria at the microscopic level. The present results examine the accumulation of photosensitizers by Mycobacterium phlei and Mycobacterium smegmatis, which serve as models for the important pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium bovis. The kinetics of porphyrin synthesis after treatment with the precursors ALA and h-ALA were studied. The goal was to describe the biosynthesis and the pharmacokinetics of sensitizers in both bacterial strains using fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy. We could show that both Mycobacterium strains enrich porphyrins after ALA and h-ALA administration detected by fluorescence peaks at about 620nm. By HPLC analyses the major porphyrin could be identified as coproporphyrin. In the future we will apply the new knowledge in in vitro and in vivo experiments to strains of M. tuberculosis, M. leprae and M. bovis and examine cell destruction by PDI.",M2
19646894,"Porphyrin synthesis from aminolevulinic acid esters in endothelial cells and its role in photodynamic therapy.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may cause tumour cell destruction by direct toxicity or by inducing microcirculatory shutdown. Protoporphyrin IX generated from 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) has been widely used as an endogenous photosensitiser in PDT. However, the hydrophilic nature of the ALA molecule limits its penetration through the stratum corneum of the skin and cell membranes and thus, ALA alkyl-esters have been developed to improve ALA permeation. The aim of this work was to study Protoporphyrin IX synthesis from ALA and its derivatives ALA methyl ester (Me-ALA) and ALA hexyl ester (He-ALA) in the microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 derived from normal skin, and to evaluate their response to PDT. We found that lower light doses are required to photosensitise HMEC-1 endothelial cells than to photosensitise PAM212 transformed keratinocytes, showing some possible selectivity of ALA-PDT for vascularisation in skin. Employed at concentrations leading to equal Protoporphyrin IX synthesis, ALA, He-ALA and Me-ALA presented the same efficacy of HMEC-1 photosensitisation. However, He-ALA was a promising compound for the use in the enhancement of Protoporphyrin IX in HMEC-1 cells employed at low concentrations at both short and long time exposures whereas Me-ALA should be employed at high concentrations and longer time periods in order to surpass the Protoporphyrin IX levels obtained with ALA. The advantage of Me-ALA over ALA was based on its lower dark toxicity. This is the first work to report vascular cell photosensitisation employing alkyl-esters of ALA, and we demonstrated that these derivatives could exert the same effect as ALA and under certain conditions enhance photosensitisation of vasculature.",M2
19639250,"Association of F18-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosin uptake and 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence in gliomas.PURPOSE: Malignant gliomas are highly infiltrative tumours with a fatal prognosis. F18-fluoroethyl-tyrosine (FET)-positron emission tomography (PET) often reveals a broader extension of these tumours compared with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete resection of the contrast-enhancing lesion is aspired. Fluorescence-guided resection using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) improved the extent of resection. In this study, we investigated whether the FET uptake correlates with the extent of resection using 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. METHODS: Thirteen patients who underwent preoperative and postoperative MRI, FET-PET and fluorescence-guided neuronavigated resection were included in this study. The areas in which intraoperative fluorescence terminated the resection were marked. After fusion of PET and MRI, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FET related to normal brain (SUV(R)) was measured in regions of interest corresponding to resected and remaining tissue, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the optimal threshold of the relative SUV anticipating 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. RESULTS: During resection a vivid fluorescence was present in all patients. Histology revealed glioblastomas in 11 cases, an anaplastic astrocytoma in one case and a low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The median FET SUV(R) was higher in areas corresponding to the fluorescent tumour compared with the non-fluorescent normal brain (2.321 vs 1.142, p &lt; 0.0001, t-test). A SUV(R) greater than 1.374 predicted the fluorescence with a sensitivity of 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.94] and a specificity of 0.94 (CI: 0.84-0.99). The area under the ROC curve was 0.9656 (CI: 0.9364-0.9948). CONCLUSIONS: FET uptake predicts the 5-ALA-induced fluorescence in glioma patients. Thus, FET-PET provides useful information for planning glioma resection.",M2
19639112,"Topical photodynamic therapy with porphyrin precursors--assessment of treatment-associated pain in a retrospective study.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) or methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) is an approved modality for the non-invasive treatment of actinic keratoses (AK) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) offering excellent cosmetic outcome. However, pain during and after illumination is the most frequent and limiting side effect. The aim of this study was to precisely assess how reported pain during PDT is influenced by sex, age, treatment site, disease (AK/BCC) as well as the photosensitizer used. 467 lesions consisting of AK (primary treatments: n=158; follow-up: n=47) or BCC (primary treatments: n=138; follow-up: 124) were treated by ALA- or MAL-PDT using metal halide lamps (580-750 nm). Pain was assessed during illumination using a continuous visual analogue scale (VAS). Factors predictive for higher pain levels during PDT are treatment of the head, treating AK and using ALA. The observed results may improve patient management and predict which level of pain to expect, and what kind of pain relief to prepare.",M2
19618861,"[Intraoperative photo-dynamic diagnosis of brain tumors]Conventionary, we use 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) for photo-dynamic diagnosis in the removal of malignant gliomas. 5-ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the body and emits red fluorescence, with the excitation of blue-violet light. As PpIX preferentially accumulates in the tumor tissue in comparison with normal tissue, this red fluorescence becomes a good hallmark for discrimination between normal and tumor tissues, especially in malignant gliomas, which have infiltrative characteristics. Approximately 80% to 90% of the malignant gliomas show this red fluorescence in surgery as mentioned above, while only a limited number of metastatic brain tumor cases do. In the surgery for metastatic brain tumor and lesionectomy for radiation necrosis and neurodegenerative disease, white matter around the lesion showed vague fluorescence, which also provided us with a hallmark in the surgery. Additionally, in meningioma, some tumors showed the red fluorescence, which is especially helpful in the removal of the infiltrative portion in the bone and normal parenchyma. In this paper, we also discuss high quality international reserch on 5-ALA-guided surgery for malignant gliomas. The most important point in 5-ALA-guided microsurgery is the use of good equipment that can provide sufficient operative fields even under fluorescence mode.",M2
19614904,"Dramatic clearance of a recalcitrant acral viral wart using methyl aminolevulinate-red light photodynamic therapy.A 20-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of a viral wart located on his right thumb. Cryotherapy was administered weekly to the wart over 5 months without any significant improvement. A decision was made to treat the wart with red light photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) administered as three treatments 1-week apart. The patient was reviewed 4 weeks after the third treatment and the wart was found to have cleared completely. Three months after the last treatment, there remained no clinical evidence of recurrence of the wart. Pain was the main problem with the treatment but it was tolerable. Although the successful treatment of recalcitrant acral viral warts with PDT using 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is well documented, this is the first report of the successful PDT treatment of a recalcitrant acral viral wart using the methylester derivative of ALA. We believe that MAL is a valuable alternative photosensitizer to ALA as it is more lipophilic, has better penetration and causes less pain.",M2
19614897,"A time course investigation of the fluorescence induced by topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid and methyl aminolevulinate on normal human skin.BACKGROUND: Treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) with topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment of choice for many clinicians. The two most commonly used PDT photosensitizer precursors are 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and methyl aminolevulinate (MAL). Current PDT treatment regimes advise longer (4-6 h) application times for ALA and shorter times (3 h) for MAL. AIMS: To establish the time course characteristics of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence following the application of ALA and MAL in normal skin. METHODS: A total of 17 healthy volunteers were recruited, and both ALA and MAL were applied to the inner forearm for varying times (1-6 h). PpIX fluorescence was detected using a non-invasive spectroscopy system. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: PpIX fluorescence (following the application of either ALA or MAL) is dependent on duration of application. Following the application of ALA for 1-3 h peak fluorescence was noted at 7 h. Longer duration times (4-6 h) resulted in sustained fluorescence, which peaked at 24 h. MAL-induced fluorescence peaked at 7 h and was significantly decreased by 24 h for all application times. ALA induced fluorescence was shown to be significantly greater than MAL. The findings from this study have shown that potentially it would be more beneficial to apply ALA for shorter periods of time and MAL for longer than current practice.",M2
19592269,"New aspects in photodynamic therapy of actinic keratoses.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) or its methyl ester (MAL) is a very effective method to treat actinic keratosis (AK). New developments will contribute to optimization of this treatment modality. This will partly be based on a better understanding of the nature of AKs. Since pain during treatment is a frequent side effect of PDT, new methods of alleviating pain are of high interest, especially when large areas are treated. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of specific protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation can lead to further increase the response rates. New formulations might contribute to a wider acceptance of the treatment, for example a self-adhesive patch containing 5-ALA, promises easy handling, while maintaining high efficacy. New concepts in illumination, such as ambulatory PDT or daylight illumination might contribute to the further acceptance of this method.",M2
19569177,"Precise detection of lymph node metastases in mouse rectal cancer by using 5-aminolevulinic acid.Accurate diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) is essential in choosing appropriate treatment for gastrointestinal carcinoma. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic power of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) for LN metastasis in mouse rectal cancer. Colorectal cancer cell lines, isolated cells from normal LNs, and orthotopic mouse model incorporating enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged and untagged human rectal cancer cells were studied after 5-ALA administration by using confocal microscopy, fluorescence stereomicroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), multichannel spectrophotometry and macroconfocal imaging system to precisely detect LN metastases. In vitro confocal microscopic analyses showed that all colorectal cancer cell lines tested were positive for 5-ALA-induced fluorescence, whereas isolated normal LN cells were negative. 5-ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) fluorescence, verified by FLIM and multichannel spectrophotometry, revealed LN metastases in mice-bearing human rectal cancer cells. Occult LN metastases, unrecognized on white-light imaging and simplified hematoxylin-eosin analyses, were readily detectable on 5-ALA-induced PPIX fluorescence imaging. In vivo macroconfocal images clearly revealed PPIX-fluorescence-positive cancer cells in draining lymph vessels and nodes. Together with specific speckled patterns of PPIX-fluorescence in metastatic lesions, the PPIX-fluorescence intensity ratio of metastatic and nonmetastatic lesions discriminated metastasis with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in excised whole LN samples. These results show that fluorescence diagnosis with 5-ALA is very accurate in the detection of LN micrometastases of mouse rectal cancer, suggesting that this feasible diagnostic approach is applicable to target sectioning of metastases of resected fresh whole node samples in pathology laboratories.

19560367,"Comparation of liposomal formulations of <e>ALA</e> Undecanoyl ester for its use in photodynamic therapy.ALA administration has been used to induce the endogenous photosensitiser Protoporphyrin IX for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumours. However, the hydrophilic nature of ALA limits its ability to penetrate through skin restricting the use of ALA-PDT to superficial diseases. Lipophilic derivatives of ALA such as ALA Undecanoyl ester (Und-ALA) were designed to have better diffusing properties. However, Und-ALA, applied topically on the skin over the tumour, induced low porphyrin content. To improve Und-ALA efficacy we tested the efficacy of Und-ALA as porphyrin inducer, delivered in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol (PC-PG) or phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid (PC-PA) liposomal formulations. Entrapment of Und-ALA into PC-PA or PC-PG liposomes resulted in a dramatic impairment of toxicity in the mammary tumour LM3 cells. However, liposomal Und-ALA induced lower intracellular porphyrin content compared to free ALA, although total porphyrins content (intracellular+media) from free Und-ALA resulted equal compared to liposomal Und-ALA, due to induction of porphyrins release induced by the latter. Topical administration of Und-ALA in PC-PG or PC-PA liposomes over the skin of LM3 subcutaneously injected mice, induced equal amount of tumour porphyrins as compared to free Und-ALA. The kinetics of porphyrins synthesis from Und-ALA is similar for free and liposomal formulations both in vivo and in vitro, showing that release of Und-ALA from liposomes is not gradual and suggesting that liposome membranes either fuses or binds to the cell membranes. To sum up, the incorporation of Und-ALA into liposomes of PC-PA or PC-PG composition does not improve the rate of porphyrin synthesis either in vitro or in vivo, due to a massive release of extracellular porphyrins and a poor cytoplasmatic release of the liposome content. The design of new liposome compositions either favouring endocytosis or coated with natural polymers to prevent Und-ALA interaction with cellular membrane are desired to overcome intracellular porphyrin release after long-chained ALA esters treatment.",M2
19557521,"Parallel pigment and transcriptomic analysis of four barley albina and xantha mutants reveals the complex network of the chloroplast-dependent metabolism.We investigated the pigment composition and the transcriptome of albina (alb-e ( 16 ) and alb-f ( 17 )) and xantha (xan-s ( 46 ) and xan-b ( 12 )) barley mutants to provide an overall transcriptional picture of genes whose expression is interconnected with chloroplast activities and to search for candidate genes associated with the mutations. Beside those encoding plastid-localized proteins, more than 3,000 genes involved in non-chloroplast localized metabolism were up-/down-regulated in the mutants revealing the network of chloroplast-dependent metabolic pathways. The alb-e ( 16 ) mutant was characterized by overaccumulation of protoporphyrin IX upon <e>ALA</e> (5-amino levulinic acid) feeding and down-regulation of the gene encoding one subunit of Mg-chelatase, suggesting a block of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway before Mg-protoporphyrin IX biosynthesis, while alb-f ( 17 ) overaccumulated Mg-protoporphyrin IX and repressed PorA expression, without alterations in Mg-chelatase mRNA level. The alb-f ( 17 )mutant also showed overexpression of several genes involved in phytochrome and in phytochrome-dependent pathways. The results indicate that the down-regulation of Lhcb genes in alb-e ( 16 ) cannot be mediated by the accumulation of Mg-protoporphyrin IX. After ALA treatment, xan-s ( 46 ) showed overaccumulation of Mg-protoporphyrin IX, while the relative porphyrin composition of xan-b ( 12 ) was similar to wild type. The transcripts encoding the components of several mitochondrial metabolic pathways were up-regulated in albina/xantha leaves to compensate for the absence of active chloroplasts. The mRNAs encoding gun3, gun4, and gun5 barley homologous genes showed significant expression variations and were used to search for co-expressed genes across all samples. These analyses provide additional evidences on a chloroplast-dependent covariation of large sets of nuclear genes.",M2
19555249,"Processing difficulties and instability of carbohydrate microneedle arrays.BACKGROUND: A number of reports have suggested that many of the problems currently associated with the use of microneedle (MN) arrays for transdermal drug delivery could be addressed by using drug-loaded MN arrays prepared by moulding hot melts of carbohydrate materials. METHODS: In this study, we explored the processing, handling, and storage of MN arrays prepared from galactose with a view to clinical application. RESULTS: Galactose required a high processing temperature (160 degrees C), and molten galactose was difficult to work with. Substantial losses of the model drugs 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and bovine serum albumin were incurred during processing. While relatively small forces caused significant reductions in MN height when applied to an aluminium block, this was not observed during their relatively facile insertion into heat-stripped epidermis. Drug release experiments using ALA-loaded MN arrays revealed that less than 0.05% of the total drug loading was released across a model silicone membrane. Similarly, only low amounts of ALA (approximately 0.13%) and undetectable amounts of bovine serum albumin were delivered when galactose arrays were combined with aqueous vehicles. Microscopic inspection of the membrane following release studies revealed that no holes could be observed in the membrane, indicating that the partially dissolved galactose sealed the MN-induced holes, thus limiting drug delivery. Indeed, depth penetration studies into excised porcine skin revealed that there was no significant increase in ALA delivery using galactose MN arrays, compared to control (P value &lt; 0.05). Galactose MNs were unstable at ambient relative humidities and became adhesive. CONCLUSION: The processing difficulties and instability encountered in this study are likely to preclude successful clinical application of carbohydrate MNs. The findings of this study are of particular importance to those in the pharmaceutical industry involved in the design and formulation of transdermal drug delivery systems based on dissolving MN arrays. It is hoped that we have illustrated conclusively the difficulties inherent in the processing and storage of carbohydrate-based dissolving MNs and that those in the industry will now follow alternative approaches.",M2

This study reports the results obtained after three to four treatments with ALA-PDT in patients with acne (n=12), photoaging (n=8) and vitiligo (n=6).

19533757,"Skin fluorescence controlled photodynamic photorejuvenation (wrinkle reduction).BACKGROUND: Identical skin fluorescence can be obtained after one hour spraying with 0.5% liposome-encapsulated 5-<e>ALA</e> and after 0.5 hour application of 20% 5-ALA in a cream base. In this study the clinical outcome and side effects using the 0.5% 5-ALA in Caucasian skin are investigated and compared to earlier reported non-ablative treatments for wrinkles and improvements of skin texture using 20% ALA photodynamic photorejuvenation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 37 healthy Caucasian female patients participated in a randomized, prospective split face study. Two different intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment modalities were investigated; both employed a pre-treatment of approximately one hour of spraying with 0.5% liposome encapsulated 5-ALA. One modality combined type I photorejuvenation with wrinkle reduction (C-PDT) using a waveband from 530 to 750 nm and short pulse durations (7 J/cm(2), 2 x 2.5 ms, delay 10 ms). The other modality (PDT alone) emitted a band of wavelengths from 400 to 720 nm, three passes were performed (3.5 J/cm(2), 30 ms pulse duration). RESULTS: After a series of three C-PDT or PDT-alone treatments, the patients obtained statistically significant (P&lt; 5 x 10-5) reductions in periorbital and perioral wrinkles. Using the Fitzpatrick wrinkle scale, periorbital wrinkles were reduced by 1.2 grades (SD: 1.1) and 1.1 (SD: 1.1), respectively and perioral wrinkles were reduced by 0.8 grades (SD: 1.0) and 0.7 (SD: 0.9) respectively. The difference in treatment efficacy between. C-PDT and PDT alone treated sides was not statistically significant (P = 0.224). CONCLUSION: The present study shows that statistically significant improvements in wrinkle reduction and skin texture, equivalent to previously reported results obtained with 20% ALA, can be obtained with 0.5% liposome encapsulated 5-ALA. Only minor and infrequent side effects were registered at the 0.5% 5-ALA treated areas. Skin fluorescence monitoring during pre-treatrnent with 5-ALA may improve clinical efficacy, reduce time consumption and increase safety of the treatment.",M2
19524035,"Signaling events in apoptotic photokilling of 5-aminolevulinic acid-treated tumor cells: inhibitory effects of nitric oxide.Antitumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) employs a photosensitizing agent, molecular oxygen, and visible light to produce reactive oxygen species that can destroy tumor and tumor vasculature cells. NO produced by these cells could be procarcinogenic by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth. We recently showed that NO from a chemical donor or activated macrophages makes COH-BR1 breast tumor cells more resistant to photokilling sensitized by 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-generated protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Signaling events associated with this hyperresistance have now been examined. ALA-treated COH-BR1 cells containing mitochondria-localized PpIX died mainly by apoptosis after being irradiated. Underlying redox signaling associated with MAP kinase (ERK1/2, p38, JUN) phosphorylation-activation, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) upregulation was studied using immunoprecipitation and Western blot methodology. ALA/light treatment resulted in activation of proapoptotic JNK and p38 alpha, and deactivation of prosurvival p38 beta and ERK1/2. Involvement of both JNK and p38 in apoptosis was established by using a specific inhibitor for each. Spermine NONOate-derived NO, introduced immediately before irradiation, provided substantial protection against apoptosis. This was accompanied by greater HO-1 induction and a strong inhibition of each MAP kinase effect seen in the absence of NO. Downstream of JNK and p38 alpha activation, a marked upregulation/activation of proapoptotic Bax and Bid was observed along with down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, each response being reversed by NO. These findings provide new insights into signaling activity associated with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in ALA-PDT and how this activity can be modulated by NO.",M2
19521986,"Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid and diamino acid derivatives of protoporphyrin IX reduces papillomas in mice without eliminating transformation into squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat malignant and nonmalignant diseases. It is also used for cosmetological skin treatment. PDT is generally considered to have a low risk of carcinogenicity. However, instances of nonmalignant human tumors turning malignant have been linked to PDT. In this study, we used 5-aminolevulinic (<e>ALA</e>) acid and 3 water soluble photosensitizers-PP(Arg)(2), PP(Ser)(2)Arg(2), PP(Ala)(2)Arg(2), all diamino acid derivatives of protoporphyrin IX-to treat benign papillomas in FVB/N mice induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Of these drugs, ALA and PP(Arg)(2) were found the most efficient. PDT reduced the number of papillomas, but with increasing effectiveness of the drugs, the risk of malignant transformation of the papillomas into squamous cell carcinomas increased. The underlying mechanisms are not clear and further investigations are needed.",M2
19513974,"[Fluorescence guided resection of malignant brain tumors - breakthrough in the surgery of brain tumors]Malignant gliomas, among others the glioblastoma multiforme, are the most frequent brain tumors. The glioblastoma itself represents the most unfavorable tumor. In Switzerland, about 450 humans contract a glioblastoma each year. The median survival time is under 12 months, thus the prognosis is dismal despite a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical resection presents the major constituent in the management of patients with a glioblastoma. Postoperative radio- and chemotherapy have beneficial effects on the survival time and quality of life. Surgical removal of glioblastomas is challenging due to their infiltrative growth pattern. Therefore, the target extent of resection can only be achieved partially. For some time now, a new in Germany developed method is used in the Neurosurgical Clinic of the Cantonal Hospital in St. Gallen: The 5-<e>ALA</e>-guided microsurgical resection method allows a targeted and secure surgical resection of the tumor. A preoperative administered substance colors the tumor and makes it better visible for the neurosurgeon. Consequently, the healthy brain tissue can be better distinguished from the tumor. This permits not only a larger complete surgical resection of the tumor but also minimizes the resection of healthy tissue.",M2
19492812,"Improved peptide prodrugs of 5-<e>ALA</e> for PDT: rationalization of cellular accumulation and protoporphyrin IX production by direct determination of cellular prodrug uptake and prodrug metabolization.Twenty-seven dipeptide derivatives of general structure Ac-Xaa-ALA-OR were synthesized as potential prodrugs for 5-aminolaevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT). Xaa is an alpha-amino acid, chosen to provide a prodrug with appropriately tailored lipophilicity and water solubility. Although no simple correlation is observed between downstream production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in PAM212 keratinocytes and HPLC-derived descriptors of compound lipophilicity, quantification of prodrug uptake reveals that most of the dipeptides are actually more efficiently accumulated than ALA in PAM212 and also A549 and Caco-2 cell lines. Subsequent ALA release is the limiting factor, which emphasizes the importance of decoupling prodrug uptake and intracellular metabolization when assessing the efficacy of ALA derivatives for PDT. In agreement with PpIX fluorescence studies, at a concentration of 0.1 mM, l-Phe derivatives 4m and 4o, and l-Leu, l-Met, and l-Glu derivatives 4f, 4k, and 4u, exhibit significantly enhanced photoxicity in PAM212 cells compared to ALA.",M2
19486427,"Modelling the photosensitization-based inactivation of Bacillus cereus.AIMS: To study and to develop a model for the photo-destruction of the foodborne pathogen Bacillus cereus, initially treated with a precursor of endogenous photosensitizers (5-aminolevulinic acid, <e>ALA</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cells were incubated in the presence of ALA (3 or 7.5 mmol l(-1)) for incubation times ranging from 2 to 60 min, inoculated onto the surface of LB Agar plates and submitted to light irradiation. The Weibull model was used to describe the survival curves of B. cereus. Quadratic equations were used to describe the effects of ALA concentration and incubation time on the Weibull model parameters. RESULTS: ALA-based photosensitization proved to be an effective tool for inactivation of B. cereus. The decrease in viable counts observed after 20 min of irradiation, ranged from 4 to 6 log CFU g(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The developed model proved to be a parsimonious and robust solution to describe the observed data. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of photosensitization on B. cereus on agar plates. The model developed may be useful to optimize inactivation treatments by photosensitization.",M2
19480541,"Fluorescence diagnosis of tumor cells in hemangioblastoma cysts with 5-aminolevulinic acid.Peritumoral hemangioblastoma cysts are usually composed of fibrous tissue without tumor cells. The authors describe the first case in which fluorescence with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) was used to diagnose a hemangioblastoma tumor in a peritumoral cyst wall. A 27-year-old woman with a homogeneous, enhanced nodular lesion in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum underwent surgical treatment. After the nodular lesion was removed, the cyst region was observed with the aid of a semiconductor laser with a peak wavelength of 405 +/- 1 nm, which was powered using a fiberoptic cable. The cyst region was visualized with strong fluorescence, which disappeared after tissue removal. The fluorescent cyst consisted of tumor cells. The authors conclude that fluorescence diagnosis performed using 5-ALA can inform the choice of removing hemangioblastoma cysts.",M2
19470041,"Intraindividual, right-left comparison of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy vs. 5% imiquimod cream for actinic keratoses on the upper extremities.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) are considered as in situ squamous cell carcinoma. Early and effective treatment is important. Objective To compare the efficacy, cosmetic outcome and patient preference of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (<e>ALA</e>-PDT) with that of 5% imiquimod (IMIQ) cream in patients with AKs on the dorsa of hands and forearms. METHODS: Subjects received two ALA-PDT treatment sessions and one or two courses of imiquimod (three times per week for 4 weeks each). Treatments were randomly allocated to alternate upper extremities. Assessments included lesion response one and six months after treatment, cosmetic outcome evaluated by the investigators and patients' preference 6 months after treatment. Efficacy end point included the individual AK lesion clearance rate. RESULTS: Thirty patients with 256 lesions were included in the study. At the first follow-up, treatment with ALA-PDT resulted in significantly larger rate of cured lesions relative to 5% IMIQ cream (70.16% vs. 18.26%). At the second follow-up both treatments showed a high rate of cured lesions (65.32% for PDT vs. 55.65% for IMIQ cream). Response rates obtained in grade I lesions were higher for both treatments (71.64% for PDT vs. 72.13% for IMIQ), while treatment with PDT resulted in a significant larger rate of cured grade II lesions (57.89% for PDT vs. 37.03 for IMIQ). Difference in cosmetic outcome was not statistically significant. Results for subject preference favoured ALA-PDT. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ALA-PDT and 5% IMIQ cream are both attractive treatment options for upper extremities AKs with comparable efficacy and cosmetic outcomes.",M2
19469901,"A comparison of 5-aminolaevulinic acid- and its heptyl ester: dark cytotoxicity and protoporphyrin IX synthesis in human adenocarcinoma WiDr cells and in athymic nude mice healthy skin.5-aminolevulinic acid heptyl ester was investigated in human adenocarcinoma WiDr cells and in healthy skin of athymic nude mice in comparison with 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Incubation of WiDr cells with ALA and ALA heptyl ester resulted in production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Concentrations higher than 0.01 mm of ALA heptyl ester and higher than 1 mm of ALA were cytotoxic. The dark cytotoxicity was not related to PpIX. Intracellular localization, photocytoxicity and photobleaching rate of PpIX were the same for both drugs, although a 100 times lower concentration of ALA heptyl ester (0.01 mm) was needed in comparison with ALA (1 mm) to induce the same level of PpIX. ALA heptyl ester, topically (but not systemically) applied, is a promising candidate for fluorescence diagnosis and photodynamic therapy. Special attention must be focused on the concentrations of ALA heptyl ester; as excess may lead to cytotoxicity and inefficient PpIX generation.",M2
19447864,"Low-dose methotrexate enhances aminolevulinate-based photodynamic therapy in skin carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.PURPOSE: To improve treatment efficacy and tumor cell selectivity of delta-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) via pretreatment of cells and tumors with methotrexate to enhance intracellular photosensitizer levels. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Skin carcinoma cells, in vitro and in vivo, served as the model system. Cultured human SCC13 and HEK1 cells, normal keratinocytes, and in vivo skin tumor models were preconditioned with methotrexate for 72 h and then incubated with ALA for 4 h. Changes in protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) levels and cell survival after light exposure were assessed. RESULTS: Methotrexate preconditioning of monolayer cultures preferentially increased intracellular PpIX levels 2- to 4-fold in carcinoma cells versus normal keratinocytes. Photodynamic killing was synergistically enhanced by the combined therapy compared with PDT alone. Methotrexate enhancement of PpIX levels was achieved over a broad methotrexate concentration range (0.0003-1.0 mg/L; 0.6 nmol/L-2 mmol/L). PpIX enhancement correlated with changes in protein expression of key porphyrin pathway enzymes, approximately 4-fold increase in coproporphyrinogen oxidase and stable or slightly decreased expression of ferrochelatase. Differentiation markers (E-cadherin, involucrin, and filaggrin) were also selectively induced by methotrexate in carcinoma cells. In vivo relevance was established by showing that methotrexate preconditioning enhances PpIX accumulation in three models: (a) organotypic cultures of immortalized keratinocytes, (b) chemically induced skin tumors in mice; and (c) human A431 squamous cell tumors implanted subcutaneously in mice. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy using short-term exposure to low-dose methotrexate followed by ALA-PDT should be further investigated as a new combination modality to enhance efficacy and selectivity of PDT for epithelial carcinomas.",M2
19447368,"The optimization of fluorescence imaging of brain tumor tissue differentiated from brain edema--in vivo kinetic study of 5-aminolevulinic acid and talaporfin sodium.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to clarify the optimal timing for the fluorescence imaging of brain tumor tissue differentiated from brain edema after the administration of photosensitizers. METHODS: We have performed an in vivo study of the kinetics of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) in comparison with talaporfin sodium using the rat brain tumor model and rat vasogenic edema model produced by cold injury. The in vivo kinetics of 5-ALA and talaporfin sodium in brain tumor model and the vasogenic edema model was determined by a fluorescence macroscope and a microplate reader. RESULTS: The in vivo kinetic study of 5-ALA showed mild fluorescence intensity of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in brain tumor differentiated from vasogenic edema. The mean lesion-to-normal-brain ratio (L/N ratio) in the group of brain tumor model 2h after the administration of 5-ALA was 7.78+/-4.61, which was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than that of the vasogenic edema 2h after the administration of 5-ALA (2.75+/-1.12). In vivo kinetic study of talaporfin sodium showed high fluorescence intensity and retention in brain tumor differentiated from vasogenic edema. The mean L/N ratio of the fluorescence intensity in the group of brain tumor model 12h after the administration of talaporfin sodium was 23.1+/-11.9, which was significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) than that of the vasogenic edema 12h after the administration (8.93+/-8.03). CONCLUSIONS: The optimization of fluorescence imaging of brain tumors differentiated from brain edema is possible in the case of 5-ALA within 6h, and also possible in the case of talaporfin sodium beyond 12h.",M2
19447367,"Hypericin and 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX induce enhanced phototoxicity in human endometrial cancer cells with non-coherent white light.BACKGROUND: The in vitro experiments described in this study were aimed at exploring a synergistic effect between 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and hypericin. In a previous study, enhanced phototoxicity was observed in a patient during a clinical study on 5-ALA-based photodynamic tumor localization of breast cancer. This patient ingested a hypericin containing plant extract in parallel to orally applied 5-ALA. METHODS: Human endometrial cancer cells (HEC-1A) were treated with 0.5mM of 5-ALA and 60 nM of hypericin, either separately or combined. Colony formation was assessed after illumination of the cells with both red (635 nm) and white light (400-800 nm) at a dose of 2.5 J/cm(2). Porphyrin metabolites were quantified by HPLC in cells treated with photosensitizers without subsequent illumination. RESULTS: After white light illumination, cells treated with a combination of 5-ALA and hypericin had a significant reduction in colony formation compared with cells treated with 5-ALA only. No significantly enhanced toxicity was found with red light and the 5-ALA plus hypericin combination. In addition, cells treated with both 5-ALA and hypericin tended to produce more PpIX than cells treated with 5-ALA only. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that treatment of endometrial cancer cells with both 5-ALA and hypericin followed by illumination with white light induced a significantly higher phototoxicity as revealed by colony formation. This setting which generated an in vitro effect similar to the patient's situation, might be applied in the future as an affordable and effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) modality.",M2

In this work, the effects of two precursors and an inhibitor of aminolevulinic dehydratase (ALAD) added to the VFA culture medium on the production of ALA and biomass were investigated. The experimental runs were carried out according to a Box-Behnken design. The precursors were added to the medium at the beginning of cultivation, while the inhibitor was added after 24 h. Statistical analysis indicated that levulinic acid (LA) has a positive effect on ALA production while glycine has a negative effect on biomass production. In order to enhance both ALA and biomass products, the most suitable medium was VFA medium supplemented with 3.0 mM glycine and 10 mM LA, giving ALA and biomass of 182.91 microM and 3.1 gDCW/l within 54 h.",M2

19378778,"[Fluorescence analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma with 5-aminolevulinic acid labeling]Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is a form of cancer detection based on the administration of an exogenous photoactivated compound that accumulates in malignant cells, followed by appropriate photo-irradiation. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>), which is one of these compounds, is a prodrug of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). This report describes a spectroscopic study of 5-ALA-generated PpIX fluorescence in human oral cancer cell lines. After transplanting five human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines into scid mice, the degree of tumor differentiation was evaluated by hematoxylin-and-eosin staining. Two, one, and two cell lines were poorly, moderately, and well differentiated, respectively. Under cell culture conditions, well and moderately differentiated cancer cells showed higher positive staining rates of AE1/AE3 than poorly differentiated ones in immunohistochemistry. 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence intensities of five cell lines, which were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) treated with or without deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), were measured. In all cell lines, the maximum 5-ALA-generated fluorescence intensity was found in the presence of DFO. The fluorescence intensity varied with the degree of tumor differentiation in the following order: poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated, well differentiated. These results suggest that the fluorescence intensity of oral cancer cells differs according to the degree of tumor differentiation. However, even with well differentiated cancer cells, addition of DFO could increase the photodynamic sensitivity of 5-ALA as a result of greater cellular accumulation of PpIX.",M2
19375717,"Surgical outcomes of fluorescence-guided laparoscopic partial nephrectomy using 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX.BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical performance of photodynamic diagnostic (PDD) after oral administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) for assessment of tumor type and surgical margins in laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, non-randomized single-center study. A total of 77 patients with a renal mass &lt; 4 cm diameter underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). For photosensitization, 1.5 g 5-ALA was administered orally 4 h prior to surgery. During the operation, the resection site and the outer tumor border were inspected under excitation light for characteristic red fluorescence. The results of PDD were matched up to the histological findings. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 94.1 min with a mean warm-ischemia time of 23 min. Fifty-eight of 61 (95.1%) renal cell carcinomas showed a positive response when exposed to excitation light. In 16 cases (21%), final pathology revealed a nonmalignant lesion. However, characteristic fluorescence was also detected in 1 angiomyolipoma of 16 nonmalignant lesions. False-negative rate was 3/61 (4.9%) and false-positive rate was 1/77 (1.3%), with these data corresponding to a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 94%. Further, PDD with 5-ALA was able to predict the type of the lesion with an accuracy of 94% and with a positive predictive value of 98%. Furthermore, PDD with 5-ALA also identified both cases with positive resection margins, which were confirmed on histological examinations. No side effects of systemic 5-ALA administration were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PDD after systemic administration of 5-ALA is a reliable tool to assess the type and the resection status of a suspected renal tumor during laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery.",M2
19370466,"Treatment of actinic keratoses on the dorsum of the hands: <e>ALA</e>-PDT versus diclofenac 3% gel followed by ALA-PDT. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AK) are sun-induced epithelial skin lesions, which are at risk to progress to squamous cell carcinoma. One of the treatments of AK is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which often has to be repeated. Another treatment for these lesions is diclofenac 3% gel. Although both treatments have shown to be effective, they have never been studied together. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a pre-treatment of AK on the dorsum of the hands with diclofenac 3% gel improves the efficacy of PDT. METHODS: In this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, pilot study with 10 patients, both hands were pre-treated--one with diclofenac gel and the other with placebo gel--and then the hands were treated with ALA-PDT. Total lesion number scores, total thickness scores and global improvement scores were used to assess efficacy. Pain scores were recorded during PDT. RESULTS: In both groups, the number of lesions significantly decreased. At 12 months' follow-up, significantly fewer AK were seen in the diclofenac group. Total lesion thickness scores decreased significantly in both groups. Pain during PDT was greater in the diclofenac group. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments are effective in treating AK. A pre-treatment with diclofenac gel seems to result in fewer AK at 12 months' follow-up, compared to placebo. Side effects were worse when using the active drug.",M2
19362851,"Raman spectroscopy of bladder tissue in the presence of 5-aminolevulinic acid.Raman spectroscopy has the ability to provide differential diagnosis of different cancers with high sensitivity and specificity. A major limitation in its clinical application is the weak nature of Raman signal, which inhibits scanning large surface areas of tissues. In bladder cancer diagnosis, fluorescence-guided endoscopy with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>) has gained interest as a technique that can provide such spatial differentiation, thus improving early detection and more complete removal of superficial tumors. However, several studies have demonstrated the poor specificity of this modality. Combining fluorescence with Raman spectroscopy could improve its diagnostic capability. However, little is known about the effect of agents such as 5-ALA on Raman spectra of tissue. In this paper, we present measuring Raman spectroscopy from benign and malignant bladder tissues in the presence of 5-ALA and attempt to evaluate the potential to discriminate between different pathologies. Raman spectra were recorded from 92 bladder biopsies without 5-ALA and 38 biopsies with 5-ALA using a Raman microspectrometer system at 830nm excitation. Empirical and multivariate statistical techniques were used for data analysis. Algorithms were developed to determine the effect of 5-ALA on tissue and its influence on the prediction ability of a preliminary benign/malignant prediction model. In samples with 5-ALA, an overall decrease in Raman intensity was observed when compared to the Raman spectra from samples without 5-ALA. Additionally, differences in relative intensities at 1270 and 1330cm(-1) were also noted. However, significant differences were observed in the Raman spectra of benign and malignant samples with 5-ALA indicating the potential of using Raman spectroscopy for discriminating bladder cancer in the presence of 5-ALA. The Principal-Component fed Linear-Discriminant Analysis (PCA/LDA) algorithm derived from biopsies in the absence of 5-ALA used to predict biopsies in the presence of 5-ALA resulted in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.6% and 71.1%, respectively. This suggests the presence of 5-ALA in tissue affects the Raman spectra. A PCA/LDA algorithm based on fluorescence information (i.e. PpIX fluorescence positive or negative) and the Raman spectrum of 5-ALA biopsies, had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 80.8%, respectively. This study demonstrates that applying 5-ALA affects the Raman spectra of bladder tissues. However, benign/malignant differentiation can be accomplished with a preliminary PCA/LDA algorithm, suggesting the potential of a combined diagnostic modality in vivo.",M2
19357967,"Intraoperative optical identification of pituitary adenomas.INTRODUCTION: The main goals of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery are total removal of pituitary adenomas (PAs) and preservation of normal pituitary functions. Achieving these goals is dependent upon the precise localisation of PAs during surgery, particularly secreting microadenomas. However, some microadenomas are invisible on preoperative imaging and during surgery, leading some surgeons to perform total hypophysectomy in many patients to achieve cure at the expense of panhypopituitrism. We have examined optical detection systems to identify PAs intraoperatively. This paper reports our preliminary findings. METHODS: A prospective observational study design. TECHNIQUE: Patients were given 20 mg/kg body weight 5-aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>) mixed in 30 ml of orange juice, orally 3 h before surgery. Surgery was performed in the supine position, under image guidance, through the right nostril using Storz 0 degree endoscope assisted with microsurgery as required. The endoscope was attached to photodiagnostic filters (PD) allowing switching the light from white to blue at the flick of a foot pedal. After the dura of the floor of the sella was incised a laser probe was inserted into the pituitary gland to identify the ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX spectroscopy at 632 nm, using an optical biopsy system (OBS). Once the adenoma was identified by the OBS it was exposed and examined by the PD system to detect fluorescence. The PA was removed and its type was confirmed by histopathology and correlated to the OBS and PD system findings. PATIENTS: Thirty consecutive patients were studied: 14 were non-functioning macroadenomas (NFA), 12 were secreting PAs and 4 pituitary cysts. The secreting PAs were GH (2), ACTH (3), prolactin (2) and gonadotrophins (5). Six were microadenomas (3 ACTH, 1 GH, 2 prolactin) and 20 were macroadenomas, of which 12 were invading macroadenomas. Twenty-four of these were examined by the OBS and the PD systems and six were examined by the PD system only. The true positive (sensitivity) of the PD and OBS systems were 80.8% (21/26) and 95.5% (21/22) respectively. The true negative (specificity) of PD and OBS were 75% (3/4) and 100% (2/2) respectively. The false negative rate of PD was 19.2% (5/26) and for OBS was 4.5% (1/22), while the false positive rate for PD was 25% (1/4) and for OBS was 0. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative optical identification of pituitary adenomas is a feasible and reliable way to localize pituitary adenomas during transsphenoidal surgery and it may lead to improved cure rate and preservation of normal pituitary functions.",M2
19356665,"Aminolevulinic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-assisted photodynamic diagnosis of subclinical and latent HPV infection of external genital region.The relatively high recurrence rate of genital warts can be attributed to the unsuccessful elimination of viruses in areas of subclinical and latent infection. Therefore, the identification and treatment of the subclinical and latent infection is a key to reduce the recurrence. The goal of this study is to investigate the usefulness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-assisted in situ fluorescence diagnosis of subclinical lesion and latent HPV infection. A total of 30 patients with histologically confirmed genital warts (condylomata acuminata) were subjected to topical application of ALA, acetic acid test, histopathologic examination and HPV DNA subtyping. Topical application of ALA was performed by applying 20% ALA cream to the lesion plus 2-cm margin for 2h followed by fluorescence examination. Correlations between histopathologic examination, aceto-whitening test, HPV DNA subtyping and fluorescence were examined. All warty lesions and subclinical lesions (n=25) showed red fluorescence and harbored HPV DNA (HPV6 or 11). Latent HPV infections at 0.5-2 cm away from the warty lesion also showed red fluorescence. Nonspecific fluorescence was associated with mucosa, inflammatory infiltration and erosive lesion. ALA-assisted photodynamic diagnosis could be employed for the detection of the lesion and subclinical lesion of genital warts. It is also useful in detecting latent HPV infection.",M2

19347942,"<e>ALA</e>-PDT results in phenotypic changes and decreased cellular invasion in surviving cancer cells.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms of photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been studied on the cellular and tissue levels. However, the cellular behaviors of cancer cells survived from PDT are still not clear. This study attempted to investigate the influence of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based PDT on the invasion ability as well as molecular changes in surviving cancer cells and their progeny. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic effects of ALA-PDT were evaluated using human invasive carcinoma cells (lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cells, melanoma A375 cells and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells). To study the cellular behaviors of surviving cancer cells, PDT-derived variants were established as stable cell lines after consecutive treatment with ALA-PDT. Scratch wound assay and invasion assay were performed to evaluate the migration and invasion ability in the surviving cancer cells and the established PDT-derived variants. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis were performed to examine the expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). RESULTS: Though ALA-PDT caused differential phototoxicity among these invasive carcinoma cells, reduced migration was found in all the surviving cancer cells Compared to parental cancer cells, the established PDT-derived variants exerted significant phenotypic changes of cellular morphology, reduced mitochondrial function and a suppressed cellular invasiveness. Furthermore, correlated with the reduced invasion ability, expression of EGFR was downregulated in these established PDT-derived variants. CONCLUSIONS: Except for direct cell killing, ALA-PDT could reduce EGFR expression and invasion ability of the surviving cancer cells and these effects could further pass to the progeny. The results from this study provide insights into a new mechanism by which PDT might affect cellular behaviors and tumor metastasis.",M2
19328622,"Photodynamic diagnosis using 5-aminolevulinic acid for the detection of positive surgical margins during radical prostatectomy in patients with carcinoma of the prostate: a multicentre, prospective, phase 2 trial of a diagnostic procedure.BACKGROUND: Surgical margin status after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a significant risk factor for tumour recurrence. It is an intriguing concept to find a fluorescence marker for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) to make tumour margins visible during surgery. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of identification of positive surgical margins (PSM) during open retropubic or endoscopic extraperitoneal RP by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-<e>ALA</e>)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) to enhance surgical radicality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine patients (Gleason score 6-10, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 2.3-120 ng/ml) received 20 mg/kg of body weight of 5-ALA orally and underwent RP (24 endoscopic extraperitoneal, 15 open retropubic). MEASUREMENTS: A PDD-suitable laparoscopy optic (Karl-Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) with a yellow long-pass filter was coupled to a fibre-optic light cord with an excitation light source (380-420 nm, D-Light, Karl-Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) for fluorescence excitation of PpIX and to a PDD-suitable camera for video and photo documentation by the AIDA DVD system (Karl-Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were more false-negative cases in the open group (four vs two) than in the endoscopic group but more false-positive cases in the endoscopic group (two vs none) than in the open group. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 56% and 91.6%, respectively. The sensitivity of the endoscopic cases was much higher (75% vs 38%) than for the open cases, while the specificity was higher for the open group (88.2% vs 100%). CONCLUSIONS: PDD with 5-ALA-induced PpIX during RP might be a feasible and effective method for reducing the rate of PSM. The technique seems to be more practicable during endoscopic RP rather than open RP. Further clinical studies with higher patient volumes and further development of the technique seem justified.

20471368,"Agonism with the omega-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid mediates phosphorylation of both the short and long isoforms of the human GPR120 receptor.The newly discovered G protein-coupled receptor GPR120 has recently been shown to stimulate secretion of the gut hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and cholecystokinin upon binding of free fatty acids, thrusting it to the forefront of drug discovery efforts for treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as satiety and obesity. Although sequences for two alternative splice variants of the human GPR120 receptor have been reported, there have been no studies which directly compare the signaling of these isoforms. We have identified an additional 16 amino acid gap containing four phospho-labile serine/threonine residues which is localized to the third intracellular loop of the GPR120-long (GPR120-L) isoform. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the agonist-stimulated phosphorylation profiles of this isoform would be distinct from that of the short isoform (GPR120-S). Using a clonal HEK293 cell model, we examined agonist-mediated phosphorylation of GPR120-S and GPR120-L with the omega-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Our results show rapid phosphorylation of both isoforms following agonism by either ALA or DHA. Moreover, we show no significant difference in the degree or rate of phosphorylation of both isoforms upon agonism with either ALA or DHA, suggesting that the additional gap in the longer variant is not phosphorylated. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the shorter variant exhibits significantly more pronounced basal phosphorylation in the absence of agonist, suggesting that the additional gap in the long variant may contribute to masking of constitutive phosphorylation sites. These are the first results which demonstrate specific phosphorylation of GPR120 isoforms upon agonism by free fatty acids and the first which distinguish the phosphorylation profiles of the two GPR120 isoforms.",M3
20463041,"High habitual dietary alpha-linolenic acid intake is associated with decreased plasma soluble interleukin-6 receptor concentrations in male twins.BACKGROUND: alpha-Linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is associated with a low risk of cardiovascular disease; however, the underlying mechanism is not completely known. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether habitual dietary ALA intake is associated with plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers after control for shared genetic and common environmental factors. DESIGN: We cross-sectionally studied 353 middle-aged male twins. Habitual diet was assessed with the Willett food-frequency questionnaire. Fasting plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured. Linear mixed-effect regression analysis was used to partition the overall association into within- and between-pair associations. RESULTS: A 1-g increment in habitual dietary ALA intake was associated with 11.0% lower concentrations of sIL-6R (P = 0.004) but not of IL-6 (P = 0.31), TNF-alpha (P = 0.16), or hsCRP (P = 0.36) after adjustment for energy intake, nutritional factors, known cardiovascular disease risk factors, and medications. After further control for shared genetic and common environmental factors by comparison of brothers within a twin pair, a twin with a 1-g higher ALA intake was likely to have 10.9% (95% CI: 3.7%, 17.6%; P = 0.004) lower sIL-6R concentrations than his co-twin with a low intake, whereas ALA intake was not significantly associated with plasma concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha, or hsCRP. These results were validated by using 1000 bootstrap samples. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual dietary ALA intake is inversely associated with plasma sIL-6R concentrations independent of shared genetic and common environmental influences. Lowering sIL-6R may be a mechanism underlying the cardioprotective properties of habitual dietary ALA. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00017836.",M3
20331795,"A novel bioactivity of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ester derivatives.Fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. While n-3 PUFA have been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. The n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, ALAEE, EPAEE, DHAEE were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. This study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three major n-3 PUFA, EPA, DHA, and ALA, and their ester derivatives. Our experimental data indicated that n-3 PUFA and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. This study suggested that n-3 PUFA could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.",M3
20217236,"Docosahexaenoic acid status in females of reproductive age with maple syrup urine disease.Individuals with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) have impaired metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, isoleucine, and leucine. Life-long dietary therapy is recommended to restrict BCAA intake and thus prevent poor neurological outcomes and death. To maintain adequate nutritional status, the majority of protein and nutrients are derived from synthetic BCAA-free medical foods with variable fatty acid content. Given the restrictive diet and the importance of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in neurological development, this study evaluated the dietary and fatty acid status of females of reproductive age with MSUD attending a metabolic camp. Healthy controls of similar age and sex were selected from existing normal laboratory data. Total lipid fatty acid concentration in plasma and erythrocytes was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Participants with MSUD had normal to increased concentrations of plasma and erythrocyte alpha linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) but significantly lower concentrations of plasma and erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as percent of total lipid fatty acids compared with controls (plasma DHA: MSUD 1.03 +/- 0.35, controls 2.87 +/- 1.08; P = 0.001; erythrocyte DHA: MSUD 2.58 +/- 0.58, controls 3.66 +/- 0.80; P = 0.011). Dietary records reflected negligible or no DHA intake over the 3-day period prior to the blood draw (range 0-2 mg). These results suggest females of reproductive age with MSUD have lower blood DHA concentrations than age-matched controls. In addition, the presence of ALA in medical foods and the background diet may not counter the lack of preformed DHA in the diet. The implications of these results warrant further investigation.",M3
20097509,"Effects of unsaturated fatty acids on progesterone secretion and selected protein kinases in goat granulosa cells.Previous studies in cattle have shown influences of dietary unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) supplementation on ovarian function. However, it is unclear whether these UFA exert direct or indirect effects on ovarian steroid production or their mechanisms of action. We have recently shown that 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates progesterone secretion through mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK ERK1/2) in rodent granulosa cells. Here, we investigated the effects of 3 UFAs, oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) on progesterone secretion in goat granulosa cells. Finally, we examined the effects of UFAs on MAPK ERK1/2 and AMPK phosphorylation in these granulosa cells. Oleic acid and LA (10 microM each), but not ALA (100 microM), increased progesterone secretion (P&lt;0.05) in the presence or absence of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (10(-8) M) or FSH (5 x 10(-8)M). The different AMPK subunits, except for gamma3, are present in the goat ovary. Treatment with metformin (10mM), an activator of AMPK, increased AMPK phosphorylation (P&lt;0.05) and reduced progesterone secretion by 50% (P&lt;0.05) in the basal state and in response to IGF-1 or FSH in goat granulosa cells. Oleic acid and LA had no effect on AMPK phosphorylation, whereas they rapidly increased MAPK ERK1/2 phosphorylation (P&lt;0.05). Finally, U0126, a MAPK ERK1/2 inhibitor, decreased OA- and LA-induced progesterone secretion (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that these UFAs could stimulate progesterone secretion partly through MAPK ERK1/2 in the absence of IGF-1 and FSH in goat granulosa cells. The involvement of AMPK in this process remains to be demonstrated. Taken together, some fatty acids could improve ovarian steroidogenesis through the MAPK ERK1/2 signaling pathway and, consequently, have beneficial effects on goat fertility.",M3
20049582,"Dietary source of stearidonic acid promotes higher muscle DHA concentrations than linolenic acid in hybrid striped bass.Rapid expansion of aquacultural production is placing increasing demand on fish oil supplies and intensified the search for alternative lipid sources. Many of the potential alternative sources contain low concentrations of long chain n-3 fatty acids and the conversion of dietary linolenic acid to longer chain highly unsaturated fatty acids is a relatively inefficient process in some species. A 6-week study was conducted to compare tissue fatty acid (FA) concentrations in hybrid striped bass fed either 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid; <e>ALA</e>) or 18:4n-3 (stearidonic acid; SDA). Hybrid striped bass were fed either a control diet containing fish oil, or diets containing ALA or SDA at three different levels (0.5, 1 and 2% of the diet). There were no significant differences in whole animal responses between fish fed ALA or SDA. Liver and muscle concentrations of ALA and SDA were responsive to dosages fed. However, only 22:6n-3 concentrations in muscle were significantly affected by dietary source of 18 carbon precursors. Muscle 22:6n-3 concentrations were significantly higher in fish fed SDA compared to fish fed ALA. Based on these data, it appears that feeding SDA can increase long chain n-3 fatty acid concentrations in fish muscle.",M3
20003514,"Cytotoxicity of unsaturated fatty acids in fresh human tumor explants: concentration thresholds and implications for clinical efficacy.BACKGROUND: Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) exhibit in vitro cytotoxicity against many malignant cell lines and yield decreased cancer incidence and reduced tumor growth in animal models. But clinical and animal studies to date have achieved response using only localized delivery methods such as intratumoral infusion. To explore possibilities for enhanced clinical efficacy, fresh surgical explants of tumors from 22 patients with five malignancies were exposed to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and analyzed with an in vitro chemosensitivity testing system, the Fluorescent Cytoprint Assay (FCA). A total of 282 micro-organ cultures derived from these malignant tumors were exposed to GLA and ALA at different concentrations. RESULTS: GLA and ALA exhibited greater than 90% cytotoxicity at a sharp concentration threshold between 500 microM and 1 mM against all but two malignant micro-organ cultures tested in 5-10% serum. In tests using 30-40% serum, GLA and ALA killed tumor at concentrations of 2 mM and above. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration threshold of 500 microM to 2 mM exhibited for antitumor activity by GLA and ALA is much higher than that observed in most previously reported cell culture studies but consistent with physiological concentrations found to kill tumor clinically and in animals. A mechanism of antitumor activity by unsaturated fatty acids through selective destabilization of the malignant plasma membrane is considered. An oral regimen is proposed for phase I clinical testing that could push the area under the curve for serum concentration of unbound unsaturated fatty acids over time to much higher levels than previously achieved for systemic administration and into the range that could yield antitumor response.",M3
19921446,"Prospective studies of dietary alpha-linolenic acid intake  and prostate cancer risk: a meta-analysis.Individual-based studies that investigated the relation between dietary alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) intake and prostate cancer risk have shown inconsistent results. We carried out a meta-analysis of prospective studies to examine this association. We systematically searched studies published up to December 2008. Log relative risks (RRs) were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain a pooled estimate with its 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified five prospective studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported risk estimates by categories of ALA intake. Comparing the highest to the lowest ALA intake category, the pooled RR was 0.97 (95% CI:0.86-1.10) but the association was heterogeneous. Using the reported numbers of cases and non-cases in each category of ALA intake, we found that subjects who consumed more than 1.5 g/day of ALA compared with subjects who consumed less than 1.5 g/day had a significant decreased risk of prostate cancer: RR = 0.95 (95% CI:0.91-0.99). Divergences in results could partly be explained by differences in sample sizes and adjustment but they also highlight limits in dietary ALA assessment in such prospective studies. Our findings support a weak protective association between dietary ALA intake and prostate cancer risk but further research is needed to conclude on this question.",M3
19913851,"Distribution of omega-3 fatty acids in tissues of rabbits fed a flaxseed-supplemented diet.Diets rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with decreased incidences of cardiovascular disease. The extent of incorporation and distribution of these beneficial fats into body tissues is uncertain. Rabbits were fed regular rabbit chow or a diet containing 10% ground flaxseed that is highly enriched with the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). The high-flaxseed diet resulted in an incorporation of ALA in all tissues, but mostly in the heart and liver with little in the brain. Docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid levels were also selectively increased in some tissues, and the effects were not as large as ALA. Arachidonic acid and the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids were decreased in all tissues obtained from the flax-supplemented group. Consumption of dietary flaxseed appears to be an effective means to increase ALA content in body tissues, but the degree will depend upon the tissues examined.",M3

19798733,"Effects of fatty acids on metabolism and cell growth of human colon cell lines of different transformation state.Epidemiological studies suggest that high fish intake is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer which has been linked to the high content of the n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in some fish. In this study, two different cell lines are compared in relation to their response to EPA and DHA versus the plant derived PUFAs, linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and to the ubiquitous arachidonic acid (ARA). The uptake of 100 microM of each fatty acid (FA) was determined using GC. The 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole assay for DNA quantification and the Cell-Titer-Blue assay were used to determine cell survival and metabolic activity at 2-72 h after treatment. All FAs were utilized more efficiently by the human colon adenoma cell line LT97 than by the adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. LT97 were more susceptible than HT29 cells to the growth inhibitory activities of all FAs except for DHA where both were equally sensitive. Inhibition of survival and metabolic activity by EPA and DHA increased with treatment time in both cell lines. ALA or GLA were less growth inhibitory than EPA or DHA and ARA had intermediary activity. The data show that the tested FAs are incorporated into colon cells. Furthermore, adenoma cells are more susceptible than the adenocarcinoma cells.",M3
19775712,"Postprandial effects of a lipid-rich meal in the rat are modulated by the degree of unsaturation of 18C fatty acids.The fatty acid composition of high-fat diets is known to influence the magnitude of postprandial events that increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. These variations in magnitude may be directly ascribed to differences in the channeling of lipids toward oxidation or storage. A study was designed to compare the effects of 4 dietary fats on postprandial energy expenditure and on some risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. To avoid usual confounding factors due to simultaneous variations in chain length and double-bounds number of fatty acids, dietary fats were chosen to provide mainly 18-carbon fatty acids with 0 (stearic acid [SA]), 1 (oleic acid [OA]), 2 (linoleic acid [LA]), or 3 (alpha-linolenic acid [<e>ALA</e>]) double bounds. They were given as single high-fat test meals to 4 different groups of male rats. The resting metabolic rate and the lipid and carbohydrate oxidation were measured from oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production using indirect calorimetry 2 hours before and 6.5 hours after the test meal. Plasma glucose, triglyceride, and chylomicron concentrations were determined at 0, 1.5, and 4 hours after the test meal. Postprandial concentration of glucose and triglyceride did not vary with the nature of the test meals, whereas that of chylomicrons was the highest after the LA test meal and the lowest after the SA test meal. Postprandial increase in resting metabolic rate was the highest after the LA and OA test meals, and the lowest after the SA and ALA test meals. Compared with the 3 other diets, the ALA test meal enhanced lipid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation during the early postprandial period (0.25-3.25 hours). This suggests that stearic acid may not induce all the adverse effects classically described for other saturated fatty acids and that alpha-linolenic acid may beneficially influence energy partitioning, especially during the early postprandial state.",M3
19763036,"Effect of plant- and fish-oil derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on counteraction of n-3 fatty acid shortage in adult rats fed a lard diet.These studies aimed to compare the effects of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>)+eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)+docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on plasma-lipid concentrations and preferential fat intake of rats fed a lard diet (LD). Each of 2 groups of 4-wk-old male rats was used in studies 1 and 2. In studies 1 and 2, two groups of rats received the LD (LD group) and the fish-oil diet (FD; FD group), and the LD and the perilla-oil diet (PD; PD group), respectively (dietary treatment period). After 6 wk, 6 rats per group were sacrificed. The remaining rats in studies 1 and 2 were placed on a self-selection regimen of the LD and the FD, and the LD and the PD, respectively, for 3 wk (self-selection period). After the dietary treatment period, plasma lipid concentrations in the FD group were lower than those in the LD group. However, no significant difference in the concentrations was observed between the LD group and the PD group. At the beginning of the self-selection period, the ratio of the FD intake of the LD group was higher than that of the FD group. As the the ratio of the LD group decreased and that of the FD group increased no significant difference in the ratio was observed after the 9th day during the self-selection period. No significant difference in the ratio of the PD intake was observed between the LD group and the PD group during the self-selection period. Thus, although the FD decreased plasma lipid concentration and increased the preferential FD intake of the LD group at the beginning of the self-selection period, the PD did not. Our studies clearly show that dietary EPA+DHA and ALA have different physiologic effects.",M3
19723085,"Inhibitory mechanism of omega-3 fatty acids in pancreatic inflammation and apoptosis.Oxidative stress is regarded as a major pathogenic factor in acute pancreatitis. Inflammation and apoptosis linked to oxidative stress has been implicated in cerulein-induced pancreatitis as an experimental model of acute pancreatitis. Recently, we found that reactive oxygen species mediate inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with cerulein. Omega-3 fatty acids show antioxidant action in various cells and tissues. In the present study, we investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cytokine expression in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells and whether omega-3 fatty acids suppress apoptotic cell death in pancreatic acinar cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. We found that omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6) and inhibited the activation of transcription factor activator protein-1 in cerulein-stimulated pancreatic acinar cells. DHA and ALA inhibited DNA fragmentation, inhibited the decrease in cell viability, and inhibited the expression of apoptotic genes (p53, Bax, apoptosis-inducing factor) induced by hydrogen peroxide in pancreatic acinar cells. In conclusion, omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial for preventing oxidative stress-induced pancreatic inflammation and apoptosis by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine and apoptotic gene expression of pancreatic acinar cells.",M3
19723055,"Growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of alpha-linolenic acid on estrogen-positive breast cancer cells.We tested the anticarcinogenic effect of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) as a single compound. To test the role of ALA in breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we analyzed the antiproliferative pathway and the proapoptotic pathway. ALA exhibited growth inhibition on MCF-7 cells dose-dependently of ALA in 24, 48, and 72 h, without possible cytotoxicity per se. ALA enhanced the cell growth-inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner. Second, the proapoptotic pathway showed a sub-G(1) accumulation with concomitant upregulation of proapoptotic Bax expression, as well as a downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression dose-dependently, causing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio to decrease by about 50%. Subsequent cytochrome c release and proteolytic activation of caspase-3 followed by proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase all suggest ensuing progression to apoptosis. This finding suggests that ALA alone might also be responsible for growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects on estrogen-positive breast cancer cells.",M3
19675101,"Flaxseed oil supplementation increases plasma F1-phytoprostanes in healthy men.Supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been reported to reduce lipid peroxidation products formed from arachidonic acid (F(2)-isoprostanes) in healthy humans, as well as in those under oxidative stress. alpha-Linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is a precursor to EPA and DHA; however, its conversion in humans is thought to be inefficient. ALA can also undergo free radical oxidation, forming compounds known as F(1)-phytoprostanes, which are found in all plants and are in high concentrations in plant pollens. In this study, we examined the effect of ALA supplementation on plasma and urine F(1)-phytoprostane and F(2)-isoprostane concentrations in men. Thirty-six nonsmoking men, aged 20-65 y, were recruited from the general population and randomly allocated to consume 9 g/d of either flaxseed oil (62% ALA, 5.4 g/d) or olive oil (placebo) for 4 wk in a parallel design. At baseline and after 4 wk of supplementation, blood samples and a 24-h urine sample were collected for measurement of plasma and urinary F(1)-phytoprostanes and F(2)-isoprostanes and plasma fatty acids. Compared with the olive oil group, plasma phospholipid ALA was greater (P &lt; 0.0001), as were F(1)-phytoprostanes in plasma (P = 0.049) and urine (P = 0.06) in the flaxseed oil group after 4 wk supplementation. Flaxseed oil did not affect plasma or urinary F(2)-isoprostanes. The greater plasma F(1)-phytoprostane concentration in the flaxseed oil group most likely resulted from the increased plasma concentration of the ALA substrate and/or the F(1)-phytoprostane content of the flaxseed oil. Future studies are needed to determine the physiological importance of increased plasma and urine F(1)-phytoprostanes and their relevance to heart disease prevention.",M3
19666200,"Relationship of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids with semen characteristics, and anti-oxidant status of seminal plasma: a comparison between fertile and infertile men.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Fatty acid (FA) composition of the spermatozoa may be an important determinant of fertility. The aim was to evaluate polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of the blood plasma and spermatozoa in infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). METHODS: Eighty-two infertile men with idiopathic OAT and seventy-eight fertile men defined according to semen concentration and proven fertility were enrolled in the study. The semen parameters were assessed according to World Health Organization criteria; three omega-3 fatty acids--alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and two omega-6 fatty acids--linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations were measured in blood plasma and spermatozoa; and the seminal plasma enzymatic antioxidant levels of catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also assessed. RESULTS: Proven fertile men had higher blood and spermatozoa levels of omega-3 FAs compared with the infertile patients. The ratio of serum omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids was significantly higher in infertile (14.8+/-4.3) patients compared to fertile controls (6.3+/-2.2) (P=0.001). Additionally, levels of AA were higher and the omega-3 index (EPA+DHA) was lower in infertile subjects than in fertile controls (all P values&lt;0.05). Infertile men had higher mean AA:DHA ratio and AA:EPA (6.4+/-2.9 and 12.0+/-4.9, respectively) than fertile men (3.3+/-1.8 and 6.7+/-2.6, respectively) (both P=0.001). A strong negative correlation was found between the AA:DHA and AA:EPA ratios and total sperm count (r=-0.62, P=0.001 and r=-0.64, P=0.001, respectively), sperm motility (r=-0.63, P=0.001 and r=-0.61, P=0.001, respectively), and sperm morphology (r=-0.61, P=0.001, and r=-0.59, P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infertile men had lower concentrations of omega-3 FAs in spermatozoa than fertile men. These results suggest that research should be performed to assess the potential benefits of omega-3 FA supplementation as a therapeutic approach in infertile men with idiopathic OAT.",M3
19641487,"Subchronic alpha-linolenic acid treatment enhances brain plasticity and exerts an antidepressant effect: a versatile potential therapy for stroke.Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to have therapeutic potential in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms of action underlying these effects are not well elucidated. We previously showed that alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) reduced ischemic brain damage after a single treatment. To follow-up this finding, we investigated whether subchronic ALA treatment promoted neuronal plasticity. Three sequential injections with a neuroprotective dose of ALA increased neurogenesis and expression of key proteins involved in synaptic functions, namely, synaptophysin-1, VAMP-2, and SNAP-25, as well as proteins supporting glutamatergic neurotransmission, namely, V-GLUT1 and V-GLUT2. These effects were correlated with an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels, both in vitro using neural stem cells and hippocampal cultures and in vivo, after subchronic ALA treatment. Given that BDNF has antidepressant activity, this led us to test whether subchronic ALA treatment could produce antidepressant-like behavior. ALA-treated mice had significantly reduced measures of depressive-like behavior compared with vehicle-treated animals, suggesting another aspect of ALA treatment that could stimulate functional stroke recovery by potentially combining acute neuroprotection with long-term repair/compensatory plasticity. Indeed, three sequential injections of ALA enhanced protection, either as a pretreatment, wherein it reduced post-ischemic infarct volume 24 h after a 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or as post-treatment therapy, wherein it augmented animal survival rates by threefold 10 days after ischemia.",M3
19628108,"Chia seed does not promote weight loss or alter disease risk factors in overweight adults.The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of chia seed (Salvia hispanica L) in promoting weight loss and altering disease risk factors in overweight adults. The hypothesis was that the high dietary fiber and alpha-linolenic (<e>ALA</e>) contents of chia seed would induce a small but significant decrease in body weight and fat and improve disease risk factors. Subjects were randomized to chia seed (CS) and placebo (P) groups, and under single-blinded procedures, ingested 25 g CS or P supplements mixed in 0.25 L water twice daily before the first and last meal for 12 weeks. Ninety nondiseased, overweight/obese men and women between the ages of 20 and 70 years were recruited into the study, with 76 subjects (n = 39 CS, n = 37 P) completing all phases of the study. Pre- and poststudy measures included body mass and composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), inflammation markers from fasting blood samples (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), oxidative stress markers (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and plasma nitrite), blood pressure, and a serum lipid profile. Plasma ALA increased 24.4% compared to a 2.8% decrease in CS and P, respectively (interaction effect, P = .012). No group differences were measured for changes in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (interaction effects, P = .420 and .980, respectively). Pre-to-post measures of body composition, inflammation, oxidative stress, blood pressure, and lipoproteins did not differ between CS and P for both sexes. In conclusion, ingestion of 50 g/d CS vs P for 12 weeks by overweight/obese men and women had no influence on body mass or composition, or various disease risk factor measures.",M3
19588182,"Hepatic lipid metabolism response to dietary fatty acids is differently modulated by PPARalpha in male and female mice.BACKGROUND: In human beings, women are at lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, and respond differently from men to dietary fatty acids. AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate (i) the influence of gender on the response of lipid metabolism to dietary n-3 PUFA, and (ii) the contribution of PPARalpha to this response. METHODS: Male and female mice, wild-type (WT) and PPARalpha-null (KO), were fed on diets rich in either saturated FA (SFA) or 18:3 n-3 (<e>ALA</e>). Lipid composition, mRNA levels and certain activities of key enzymes and major transcription factors were determined in the liver. WT mice were slightly affected by dietary FA. However, in WT female mice, but not in males, mRNA levels of PPARalpha-dependent genes (L-FABP, ACO) were higher in the mice fed on the ALA-rich diet. When compared to WT mice, KO female mice exhibited a decreased lipogenesis capacity (40% lower FAS, ACC, and SREBP-1c mRNA level), whereas KO males showed a decrease in peroxisomal beta-oxidation (activity and expression of ACO reduced by 20 and 40%, respectively). When compared to SFA-fed KO mice, steatosis was twice lower in KO mice fed on ALA, despite the absence of dietary effect on plasma TG, CPT1 and ACO activities, or ACC and FAS expression. Besides, in mice on the SFA diet, steatosis was alleviated in females, and CPT1 expression was up-regulated to a higher extent in females than in males (2.7- and 3.6-fold, respectively, as compared to the corresponding WT groups). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests estrogen to modulate the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolic pathway by dietary fatty acids. Besides, PPARalpha invalidation resulted in unexpected regulations by ALA of its known targets and was compensated partly in females, which was therefore less sensitive to the detrimental effects of a SFA-rich diet.",M3
19587335,"The effect of linolenic Acid on bovine oocyte maturation and development.Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids can influence reproductive performance. In dairy cattle, some high-fat diets resulted in higher blastocyst rates and improved embryo quality. These effects may partly be mediated by a direct action of fatty acids on oocyte development. The present study investigated the effect of linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>; 18:3 n-3) supplementation on bovine oocyte maturation and early embryo development in vitro. Treatment of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) with 50 muM ALA significantly increased the percentage of oocytes at the metaphase II (MII) stage compared with untreated controls (95% +/- 2% vs. 84% +/- 2%, respectively). Higher doses of ALA were detrimental. Treatment of COCs with 50 muM ALA compared with controls also resulted in a significantly higher percentage of cleaved embryos (77% +/- 9% vs. 69% +/- 9%, respectively) and blastocyst rate (36% +/- 4% vs. 23% +/- 5%, respectively) and better-quality embryos. Furthermore, COCs treated with ALA had significant increases compared with controls in: 1) prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) concentration (233% +/- 41%) in the medium, 2) intracellular cAMP at 3 h of maturation, and 3) phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) during the first 6 h of maturation. Moreover, ALA overcame the suppressive effects of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 inhibitor (NS-398) on oocyte maturation and partially improved the maturation rate in the presence of the MAPK kinase inhibitor (U-0126). Linolenic acid could not, however, recover maturation in the presence of both inhibitors. In conclusion, treatment of bovine COCs with ALA during oocyte maturation affects the molecular mechanisms controlling oocyte nuclear maturation, leading to an increased number of MII-stage oocytes and improved subsequent early embryo development. This effect is mediated both directly through MAPK pathway and indirectly through PGE(2) synthesis.",M3
19584895,"Bioavailability of alpha-linolenic acid from flaxseed diets as a function of the age of the subject.BACKGROUND: Dietary flaxseed may have beneficial cardiovascular effects. An aged population has a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, but they may react differently to flaxseed in the diet. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the response, over a period of 4 weeks, of subjects aged 18-29 or 45-69 years to a diet containing the same amount of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) (6 g) introduced in the form of ground flaxseed (30 g) or flaxseed oil. RESULTS: All subjects who received flaxseed oil showed a significant increase in plasma ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations over the course of this study. Subjects who received ground flaxseed in the 18-29-year-old group showed a statistically significant increase in their plasma ALA levels, and although there was a trend in the same direction for the 45-69-year-old subjects, this did not achieve statistical significance. The diets induced no major changes in platelet aggregation, plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in any of the groups. Younger subjects showed a decrease in triglyceride (TG) values compared with older subjects. There were no significant side effects that caused compliancy issues. CONCLUSION: Subject age does not seem to be a major determining factor in influencing ALA absorption from a flaxseed-supplemented diet nor in the metabolism of ALA to EPA in the groups fed flaxseed oil. Concerns about side effects in older subjects administered a higher fiber load in a flaxseed-supplemented diet are not justified. However, younger but not older subjects showed a beneficial decrease in circulating TGs due to flaxseed supplementation.",M3
19568181,"Flaxseed and cardiovascular health.Flaxseed and its components may improve cardiovascular health because of their numerous attributes. Flaxseed contains 35% of its mass as oil, of which 55% is alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Flax meal, which is devoid of oil, contains the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). Flaxseed, flaxseed with very low ALA, flaxseed oil, flax lignan complex (FLC), and SDG reduce the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis by 46%, 69%, 0%, 73%, and 34%, respectively, in the rabbit model. FLC and SDG slow the progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect in regression of atherosclerosis. Suppression of atherosclerosis by flaxseed is the result of its lignan content and not the result of ALA content. Suppression of atherosclerosis is associated with lowering of serum lipids and antioxidant activity. Effects of flaxseed on serum lipids in experimental animals are variable from no change to slight reduction. Flaxseed oil does not affect serum lipids, except for a slight reduction in serum triglycerides. Lignan in general reduces serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raises serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. SDG and its metabolites have antioxidant activity. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil do not have antioxidant activity except they suppress oxygen radical production by white blood cells. Flaxseed oil/ALA has variable effects on inflammatory mediators/markers (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A). Doses of ALA less than 14 g/d do not affect inflammatory mediators/markers, but 14 g/d or greater reduce inflammatory mediators/markers. Flaxseed oil decreases soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 but has no effect on soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble E-selectin, and monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Flaxseed has variable effects on IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. FLC reduces plasma levels of C-reactive protein but has no effects on IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, or monocyte chemoattractant protein. Flaxseed has a very small hypotensive effect, but flaxseed oil does not lower blood pressure. However, SDG is a very potent hypotensive agent. Flaxseed oil decreases platelet aggregation and increases platelet activating inhibitor-1 and bleeding time. Flaxseed and FLC have no effect on the hemopoietic system. SDG is a potent angiogenic and antiapoptotic agent that may have a role in cardioprotection in ischemic heart disease. In conclusion, flaxseed, FLC, and SDG, but not flaxseed oil, suppress atherosclerosis, and FLC and SDG slow progression of atherosclerosis but have no effect on regression. Flaxseed oil suppresses oxygen radical production by white blood cells, prolongs bleeding time, and in higher doses suppresses serum levels of inflammatory mediators and does not lower serum lipids.",M3
19525100,"Dietary reference intakes for DHA and EPA.Various organizations worldwide have made dietary recommendations for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and fish intake that are primarily for coronary disease risk reduction and triglyceride (TG) lowering. Recommendations also have been made for DHA intake for pregnant women, infants, and vegetarians/vegans. A Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), specifically, an Adequate Intake (AI), has been set for alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of The National Academies. This amount is based on an intake that supports normal growth and neural development and results in no nutrient deficiency. Although there is no DRI for EPA and DHA, the National Academies have recommended that approximately 10% of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for ALA can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA. This recommendation represents current mean intake for EPA and DHA in the United States ( approximately 100mg/day), which is much lower than what many groups worldwide are currently recommending. Global recommendations for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids underscore the pressing need to establish DRIs for DHA and EPA because DRIs are recognized as the  official  standard by which federal agencies issue dietary guidance or policy directives for the health and well-being of individuals in the United States and Canada. Because of the many health benefits of DHA and EPA, it is important and timely that the National Academies establish DRIs for the individual long-chain (20 carbons or greater) omega-3 fatty acids.",M3
19525080,"Recent trends in the advanced analysis of bioactive fatty acids.The consumption of dietary fats have been long associated to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, and cardiovascular disease; although some controversy still exists in the role of dietary fats in human health, certain fats have demonstrated their positive effect in the modulation of abnormal fatty acid and eicosanoid metabolism, both of them associated to chronic diseases. Among the different fats, some fatty acids can be used as functional ingredients such as alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), stearidonic acid (STA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), among others. The present review is focused on recent developments in FAs analysis, covering sample preparation methods such as extraction, fractionation and derivatization as well as new advances in chromatographic methods such as GC and HPLC. Special attention is paid to trans fatty acids due its increasing interest for the food industry.",M3
19491530,"Dietary alpha-linolenic acid inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and mRNA expression levels in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats.Several studies have shown that dietary alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and has an antihypertensive effect. Blood pressure is regulated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the present study, we investigated the effect of dietary ALA on ACE to clarify the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Six-week-old SHR were fed a diet containing either 10% ALA-rich flaxseed oil or high oleic safflower oil as a control for four weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by the tail cuff method once weekly. At the end of the feeding period, ACE activity was determined in the heart, aorta, lung and kidney. ACE mRNA in these organs was also measured by real-time PCR analysis. SBP in the ALA group was significantly lower than in the control group at 2, 3, and 4 weeks. The ACE activity and mRNA expression levels in the ALA group were significantly lower than in the control only in the aorta. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the blood pressure-lowering mechanism of dietary ALA may be involved in the reduction of ACE activity and mRNA expression levels in the aorta of SHR.",M3
19452183,"Effect of <e>ALA</e>-enriched food supply on cardiovascular risk factors in males.The outcome of a total dietary approach using a wide range of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) enriched food items on cardiovascular diseases called for further investigation. The study objective was to assess the effect of an ALA-enriched food supply on cardiovascular risk factors in healthy males. A dietary intervention (single-blind field trial with pre- and post-measurements) was performed with 59 healthy males in a Belgian prison. Over a period of 12 weeks they were supplied with an n-3 enriched diet (containing 6.5 g n-3 PUFA/day compared to 4 g n-3 PUFA/day in the standard diet) that was substituted for their regular diet, increasing mainly the alpha-linolenic acid intake (from 2.8 to around 5 g/day). The results indicated no impact on subjects waist circumference, weight and BMI or systolic blood pressure. In contrast, the diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased during the intervention period (from 74.6 +/- 8.2 to 71.7 +/- 10.1 mmHg; P &lt; 0.02). Moreover, the HDL-cholesterol level increased in non-smoking participants (from 0.97 +/- 0.25 to 1.06 +/- 0.23 mmol/l; P &lt; 0.03). In summary, the study demonstrated that enrichment of commonly eaten food items with n-3 fatty acids provides the opportunity to increase the n-3 fatty acid intake and to decrease the n-6/n-3 ratio which results in a decreasing diastolic blood pressure and an increase of HDL-cholesterol (in non-smokers).",M3
19447164,"Delayed cell migration in the developing rat brain following maternal omega 3 alpha linolenic acid dietary deficiency.Diminished levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), the major polyunsaturated fatty acid (FA) synthesized from alpha linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>, 18:3n-3), have been implicated in changes in neurotransmitter production, ion channel disruption and impairments of a variety of cognitive, behavioral and motor functions in the perinatal and adult mammal. Neuronal migration in the cortex and hippocampus of newborn and postnatal rats after ALA-deficiency, beginning on the 2nd day after conception and continuing for three weeks, was investigated. A marked decrease in the migration of bromodeoxyuridine((+))/neuronal nuclei((+))/neurofilament((+)) and glia fibrillary acidic protein((-)) neuronal cells to the dense cortical plate was accompanied by a corresponding abundance of non-migrating cells in several regions such as cortical layers IV-VI, corpus callosum and the sub-ventricular zone of ALA-deficient newborns. Similarly, a delayed migration of cells to CA1 and dentate gyrus areas was noticed while most cells were retained in the subicular area adjacent to the hippocampus. The reversibility of delay in migration in the hippocampus and cortex, after one and two weeks respectively, may be attributed to a temporary reelin disorganization or partial deficiency. Transient obstruction of neuronal cell migration may have long-lasting consequences on the organization of neuronal assemblies, on the connection between neurons (lateral connections) and acquisition of function in the adult brain.",M3
19367077,"Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on vascular reactivity in aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats.Several studies of hypertension have shown that dietary alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) has a blood pressure-lowering effect. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dietary ALA on endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity in six-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). At the end of the feeding period, systolic blood pressure in the ALA group was significantly lower than in the control group. There was no significant difference in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant response between the two diet groups. There was also no significant inter-group difference in the vascular wall thickness and media-to-lumen ratio. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the blood pressure-lowering mechanism of dietary ALA does not involve increased sensitivity to NO or a change the in vascular morphology of the aorta.",M3
19326346,"Alpha-linolenic acid-rich flaxseed oil ingestion increases plasma adiponectin level in rats.Adiponectin, an adipose-specific secretory protein, exhibits antidiabetic and antiatherogenic properties. The effect of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) on adiponectin has not been revealed. ALA is included abundantly in vegetable oils such as flaxseed oil. In this study, we attempted to clarify the effect of ALA-rich flaxseed oil (FSO) intake on the adiponectin level in rats. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed test diets containing high oleic safflower oil (HOSO) or FSO for 4 weeks. After the experimental period, the plasma adiponectin concentration in the FSO-fed group was higher than that in the HOSO-fed group. The adiponectin content of perirenal adipose tissue in the FSO-fed group was also significantly higher than that in the HOSO-fed group. However, the adiponectin mRNA level in the perirenal adipose tissue did not differ significantly between the HOSO-fed and FSO-fed groups. In this study, we clarified the effect of the ALA-rich FSO ingestion on the plasma adiponectin concentration in rats. It was suggested that the ALA-rich FSO intake might exhibit beneficial effects through an increase of the adiponectin level.",M3
19321563,"The relation of alpha-linolenic acid to the risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: alpha-Linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>; 18:3n-3) has been associated inconsistently with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Additional studies have become available since the publication of 2 previous meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to review the published data on the relation between ALA and prostate cancer. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review to identify studies that included data on ALA and risk of prostate cancer. Data were pooled from studies that compared the highest ALA quantile with the lowest ALA quantile, and risk estimates were combined by using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The relation between ALA and prostate cancer is inconsistent across studies. We pooled data from 8 case-control and 8 prospective studies. The summary estimate revealed that high ALA dietary intakes or tissue concentrations are weakly associated with prostate cancer risk (relative risk [RR]: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.43). When examined by study type (ie, retrospective compared with prospective or dietary ALA compared with tissue concentration) or by decade of publication, only the 6 studies examining blood or tissue ALA concentrations revealed a statistically significant association. With the exception of these studies, there was significant heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias. After adjustment for publication bias, there was no association between ALA and prostate cancer (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Studies examining the relation between ALA and prostate cancer have produced inconsistent findings. High ALA intakes or high blood and adipose tissue concentrations of ALA may be associated with a small increased risk of prostate cancer. However, these conclusions are qualified because of the heterogeneity across studies and the likelihood of publication bias.",M3
19271319,"Dietary perilla oil lowers serum lipids and ovalbumin-specific IgG1, but increases total IgE levels in ovalbumin-challenged mice.Our previous studies indicated that alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-rich perilla oil might alleviate bronchoalveolar inflammation. However, it failed to modulate the Th1/Th2 balance toward the Th1 pole during Th2-skewed allergic airway inflammation in mice. This study attempts to further investigate the effects of dietary perilla oil on serum lipids and immunoglobulin profiles using an ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mouse model. The inbred female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed different AIN-76 feeds containing 5% corn oil (rich in linoleic acid, 18:2n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as a control diet), 5% perilla oil (rich in alpha-linolenic acid, 18:3n-3 PUFA) or 5% compound oil containing 50% corn oil and 50% perilla oil, respectively, for 35 consecutive days ad libitum. Experimental mice were sensitized by an intraperitoneal injection of alum-precipitated antigen containing ovalbumin on 7, 14 and 21 days after supply of the specified experimental diets. One week later, the mice were then challenged by aerosolized OVA. The results showed that dietary perilla oil administration significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased the relative liver tissue weight (RTW) and serum lipid levels including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol. However, the HDL/LDL ratio was also significantly lowered by dietary perilla oil. Dietary perilla oil markedly decreased serum OVA-specific IgG1 level and total IgA antibodies (Th2 antibodies). Unfortunately, it also increased non-specific serum IgE (Th2 antibody) levels. The results suggest that dietary perilla oil might have a moderately beneficial effect on asthmatic allergy via lowering serum lipids and OVA-specific IgG1, as well as total IgA levels. However, it failed to obviously modulate Th1/Th2 antibody levels via isotype switching of B cells from Th2 antibody to Th1 antibody.",M3
19269799,"alpha-Linolenic acid supplementation and conversion to n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in humans.Blood levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are considered biomarkers of status. Alpha-linolenic acid, <e>ALA</e>, the plant omega-3, is the dietary precursor for the long-chain omega-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Studies in normal healthy adults consuming western diets, which are rich in linoleic acid (LA), show that supplemental ALA raises EPA and DPA status in the blood and in breast milk. However, ALA or EPA dietary supplements have little effect on blood or breast milk DHA levels, whereas consumption of preformed DHA is effective in raising blood DHA levels. Addition of ALA to the diets of formula-fed infants does raise DHA, but no level of ALA tested raises DHA to levels achievable with preformed DHA at intakes similar to typical human milk DHA supply. The DHA status of infants and adults consuming preformed DHA in their diets is, on average, greater than that of people who do not consume DHA. With no other changes in diet, improvement of blood DHA status can be achieved with dietary supplements of preformed DHA, but not with supplementation of ALA, EPA, or other precursors.",M3
19261730,"Dietary alpha-linolenic acid, EPA, and DHA have differential effects on LDL fatty acid composition but similar effects on serum lipid profiles in normolipidemic humans.Our aim was to study the effects of increased dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on serum lipids and LDL fatty acid compositions. To this end, a controlled parallel study was conducted in 74 healthy normolipidemic men and women aged 19-43 y. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions and consumed a total intake of 4.4 g/d ALA (ALA group), 2.2 g/d EPA (EPA group), and 2.3 g/d DHA (DHA group) for 6 wk. Fatty acid ethyl esters were incorporated into margarines, which replaced the participant's normal spread. The ALA, EPA, or DHA intake led to a significant enrichment of the LDL with the respective (n-3) fatty acid. In addition, LDL EPA contents in the ALA group increased by 36% (P &lt; 0.05) with no changes in LDL DHA. The EPA intervention led to an additional enrichment with DHA (24%; P &lt; 0.001), whereas the DHA intervention further increased the amount of EPA (249%; P &lt; 0.001). ALA, EPA, or DHA intake did not affect fasting serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, but fasting serum triacylglycerol concentrations significantly decreased in the EPA (-0.14 mmol/L) and DHA (-0.30 mmol/L) interventions and also in the ALA intervention (-0.17 mmol/L). DHA intake significantly increased serum HDL cholesterol, whereas no changes were found with ALA or EPA intake. In conclusion, the present data support the hypothesis that isolated dietary ALA, EPA, and DHA intakes lead to differential enrichment in LDL due to interconversion. Moderate amounts of ALA, EPA, and DHA are effective in improving lipid profiles of normolipidemic humans.",M3
19234585,"Alpha-linolenic acid supplementation and resistance training in older adults.Increased inflammation with aging has been linked to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing older adults with alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) during a resistance training program, based on the hypothesis that ALA decreases the plasma concentration of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, which in turn would improve muscle size and strength. Fifty-one older adults (65.4 +/- 0.8 years) were randomized to receive ALA in flax oil (~14 g.day-1) or placebo for 12 weeks while completing a resistance training program (3 days a week). Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks for muscle thickness of knee and elbow flexors and extensors (B-mode ultrasound), muscle strength (1 repetition maximum), body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), and concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Males supplementing with ALA decreased IL-6 concentration over the 12 weeks (62 +/- 36% decrease; p = 0.003), with no other changes in inflammatory cytokines. Chest and leg press strength, lean tissue mass, muscle thickness, hip bone mineral content and density, and total bone mineral content significantly increased, and percent fat and total body mass decreased with training (p &lt; 0.05), with the only benefit of ALA being a significantly greater increase in knee flexor muscle thickness in males (p &lt; 0.05). Total-body bone mineral density improved in the placebo group, with no change in the ALA group (p = 0.05). ALA supplementation lowers the IL-6 concentration in older men but not women, but had minimal effect on muscle mass and strength during resistance training.",M3
19193660,"Modification of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids via complementary food enhances n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis in healthy infants: a double blinded randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of modified polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profiles of complementary food on long-chain (LC) PUFA composition in healthy infants. DESIGN: Double blinded, randomised, controlled intervention trial. SETTING: Dortmund, Germany. PATIENTS: Free-living sample of healthy term infants. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned within the first 2 months of life. During the intervention period from 4 to 10 months, the control group (n = 53) received commercial complementary meals with corn oil (3.4 g/meal) rich in n-6 linoleic acid (LA), the intervention group (n = 49) received the same meals with rapeseed oil (1.6 g/meal) rich in n-3 alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Fatty acid intake was assessed from dietary records throughout the intervention period. Fatty acid proportions (% of total fatty acid) in total plasma were analysed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Plasma fatty acid profiles did not differ between the intervention and control groups before the intervention. During the intervention, the only difference in fatty acid intake between the intervention and control groups was a higher intake of ALA in the intervention group, 21% deriving from study food and a lower ratio of LA/ALA (10.7 vs 14.8). At the end of the intervention, the plasma proportions of total n-3 fatty acids and of n-3 LC-PUFA, but not of ALA, were higher and the ratios of n-6/n-3 fatty acids were lower in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Feasible dietary modifications of the precursor fatty acid profile via n-3 PUFA-rich vegetable oil favoured n-3 LC-PUFA synthesis in the complementary feeding period when LC-PUFA intake from breast milk and formula is decreasing.",M3
19166630,"Impact of maternal dietary fatty acid composition on glucose and lipid metabolism in male rat offspring aged 105 d.In recent years the intake of n-6 PUFA and trans-fatty acids (TFA) has increased, whereas n-3 PUFA intake has decreased. The present study investigated the effects of maternal diet high in n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA or TFA on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and fatty acid profile in male offspring. Female weanling Wistar/NIN rats were randomly assigned to receive either a diet high in linoleic acid (LA), or alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), or long-chain n-3 PUFA (fish oil; FO), or TFA, for 90 d, and mated. Upon weaning, pups were randomly divided into seven groups (mother's diet-pup's diet): LA-LA, LA-ALA, LA-FO, ALA-ALA, FO-FO, TFA-TFA and TFA-LA. At the age of 105 d, an oral glucose tolerance test, adipocyte glucose transport and muscle phospholipid fatty acid composition were measured in the pups. All animals displayed normal insulin sensitivity as evidenced by similar plasma insulin and area under the curve of insulin after an oral glucose load. Maternal intake of n-3 PUFA (ALA or FO) resulted in higher n-3 PUFA in the offspring. Plasma cholesterol and NEFA were significantly higher in the TFA-TFA group compared with the other groups. Adipocyte insulin-stimulated glucose transport and adiponectin mRNA expression were lower in TFA-TFA and TFA-LA offspring compared with the other groups. While most mother-pup fatty acid combinations did not influence the measured variables in the pups, these results indicate that maternal intake of TFA led to an unfavourable profile in the pups through to the age of 105 d, whether the pups consumed TFA, or not.",M3

19157821,"Gender affects liver desaturase expression in a rat model of n-3 fatty acid repletion.Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are major components of cell membranes and have beneficial effects on human health. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) is the most biologically important n-3 PUFA and can be synthesized from its dietary essential precursor, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>; 18:3n-3). Gender differences in the efficiency of DHA bioconversion have been reported, but underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We compared the capacity for DHA synthesis from ALA and the expression of related enzymes in the liver and cerebral cortex between male and female rats. Wistar rats, born with a low-DHA status, were supplied with a suboptimal amount of ALA from weaning to 8 weeks of age. Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography, the mRNA expression of different genes involved in PUFA metabolism was determined by RT-PCR (low-density array) and the expression of proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. At 8 weeks, DHA content was higher (+20 to +40%) in each phospholipid class of female livers compared to male livers. The  Delta4,  Delta5 and Delta6 desaturation indexes were 1.2-3 times higher in females than in males. The mRNA expression of Delta5- and Delta6-desaturase genes was 3.8 and 2.5 times greater, respectively, and the Delta5-desaturase protein was higher in female livers (+50%). No gender difference was observed in the cerebral cortex. We conclude that female rats replete their DHA status more readily than males, probably due to a higher expression of liver desaturases. Our results support the hypothesis on hormonal regulation of PUFA metabolism, which should be taken into account for specific nutritional recommendations.",M3
19144731,"Does genetic variation in the Delta6-desaturase promoter modify the association between alpha-linolenic acid and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome?BACKGROUND: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are associated with protection against components of the metabolic syndrome, but the role of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), the metabolic precursor of EPA and DHA, has not been studied. The Delta(6)-desaturase enzyme converts ALA into EPA and DHA, and genetic variation in the Delta(6)-desaturase gene (FADS2) may affect this conversion. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesize that high ALA is associated with a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and that genetic variation in FADS2 modifies this association. DESIGN: We studied 1815 Costa Rican adults. Adipose tissue ALA was used as a biomarker of intake, and metabolic syndrome was identified with the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs were estimated from binomial regression models, and the likelihood ratio was used to test for effect modification. RESULTS: High concentrations of adipose tissue ALA were associated with lower PRs of the metabolic syndrome compared with low ALA (0.81; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.00, for the comparison between the highest and the lowest quintiles; P for trend &lt; 0.02). Higher concentrations of adipose tissue ALA were associated with a lower PR among homozygote (0.67; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.86) and heterozygote (0.84; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.99) carriers of the FADS2 T allele, but not among homozygote carriers of the deletion variant allele (0.99; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.27; P for interaction: 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ALA concentrations in adipose tissue are associated with lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. A lack of association among homozygote carriers of the FADS2 deletion allele suggests that this association may be due in part to the conversion of ALA into EPA.",M3
19109277,"Evidence for the inhibition of the terminal step of ruminal alpha-linolenic acid biohydrogenation by condensed tannins.Effects of condensed tannins (CT), either via extract or plant-bound, and saponin extract on ruminal biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) were investigated in vitro. Grass-clover hay served as basal diet (control). The control hay was supplemented with extracts contributing either CT from Acacia mearnsii [7.9% of dietary dry matter (DM)] or saponins from Yucca schidigera (1.1% of DM). The fourth treatment consisted of dried sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), a CT-containing forage legume, in an amount also providing 7.9% CT in dietary DM. All diets were supplemented with linseed oil at a level contributing 60% of total dietary ALA in all treatments. Diets were incubated for 10 d (n = 4) in the rumen simulation technique system, using the last 5 d for statistical evaluation. Fatty acids were analyzed in feed, feed residues, incubation fluid, and its effluent. Data were subjected to ANOVA considering diet and experimental run as main effects. Both CT treatments reduced ruminal fiber and crude protein degradation, and lowered incubation fluid ammonia concentration. Only the CT extract suppressed methane formation and shifted microbial populations toward bacteria at cost of protozoa. The saponin extract remained without clear effects on fermentation characteristics except for increased protozoal counts. The extent of ALA biohydrogenation was 20% less with the CT plant, but this probably resulted from reduced organic matter degradability rather than from an inhibition of biohydrogenation. After incubation analysis of incubation fluid effluent and feed residues showed a considerable proportion of the 3 biohydrogenation intermediates, cis-9, trans-11, cis-15 C18:3, trans-11, cis-15 C18:2, and trans-11 C18:1, which did not occur in the initial feeds. Only the CT-extract diet led to a different profile in the effluent compared with the control diet with trans-11 C18:1 being considerably increased at cost of C18:0. This could have been achieved by suppressing protozoa and enhancing the bacterial population, thus removing potential microbes involved in biohydrogenation and increasing competition between bacteria involved in biohydrogenation and others. The elevation of trans-11 C18:1 as the precursor of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid formed in body tissue and mammary gland is probably favorable from a human health point of view.",M3
19035453,"Dietary intakes of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of breast cancer.Experimental studies suggest detrimental effects of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFAs on mammary carcinogenesis, possibly in interaction with antioxidants. However, PUFA food sources are diverse in human diets and few epidemiologic studies have examined whether associations between dietary PUFAs and breast cancer risk vary according to food sources or antioxidant intakes. The relationship between individual PUFA intakes estimated from diet history questionnaires and breast cancer risk was examined among 56,007 French women. During 8 years of follow-up, 1,650 women developed invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer risk was not related to any dietary PUFA overall; however, opposite associations were seen according to food sources, suggesting other potential effects than PUFA per se. Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) intake from fruit and vegetables [highest vs. lowest quintile, hazard ratio (HR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 0.88; p trend &lt; 0.0001], and from vegetable oils (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71, 0.97; p trend 0.017). Conversely, breast cancer risk was positively related to ALA intake from nut mixes (p trend 0.004) and processed foods (p trend 0.068), as was total ALA intake among women in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin E (p trend 0.036). A significant interaction was also found between omega-6 and long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, with breast cancer risk inversely related to long-chain omega-3 PUFAs in women belonging to the highest quintile of omega-6 PUFAs (p interaction 0.042). These results emphasize the need to consider food sources, as well as interactions between fatty acids and with antioxidants, when evaluating associations between PUFA intakes and breast cancer risk.",M3
19011281,"Effects of dietary alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid on parameters of glucose metabolism in healthy volunteers.AIM: To investigate the effects of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, fructosamine, on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and on insulin sensitivity. METHODS: A randomized strictly controlled dietary study in 48 healthy volunteers (13 males, 35 females) of normal body weight (mean age 25.9 years) with three dietary groups (ALA, EPA and DHA) and a parallel design, consisting of two consecutive periods. Subjects received a 2-week wash-in diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids followed by experimental diets enriched with equal amounts of ALA, EPA, or DHA for 3 weeks. Mean dietary intake of ALA in the ALA group was 6.0 g/day (2.5% of energy intake), mean intake of EPA in the EPA group was 2.8 g/day (1.1% of energy intake) and mean intake of DHA in the DHA group was 2.9 g/day (1.1% of energy intake). RESULTS: Fasting serum concentrations of insulin and fructosamine and of HbA1c did not change significantly after consuming the ALA, EPA or DHA diet. Fasting serum glucose levels did not change significantly following either the ALA or DHA diet. During the EPA diet, fasting glucose concentration slightly increased by 0.15 mmol/l (p&lt;0.05). All measured values of all subjects were in the reference ranges for healthy adults. No effects on insulin sensitivity indicated by the HOMA insulin resistance index could be observed. CONCLUSIONS: Except for the minor effect of EPA on fasting glucose levels, the moderate amounts of dietary ALA, EPA or DHA administered in this study did not significantly affect blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, fructosamine and HbA1c in healthy normal-weight men and women over a time course of 3 weeks.",M3
18993032,"Chronic risperidone treatment preferentially increases rat erythrocyte and prefrontal cortex omega-3 fatty acid composition: evidence for augmented biosynthesis.Prior clinical studies suggest that chronic treatment with atypical antipsychotic medications increase erythrocyte and postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) omega-3 fatty acid composition in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). However, because human tissue phospholipid omega-3 fatty acid composition is potentially influenced by multiple extraneous variables, definitive evaluation of this putative mechanism of action requires an animal model. In the present study, we determined the effects of chronic treatment with the atypical antipsychotic risperidone (RISP, 3.0 mg/kg/d) on erythrocyte and PFC omega-3 fatty acid composition in rats maintained on a diet with or without the dietary omega-3 fatty acid precursor, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>, 18:3n-3). Chronic RISP treatment resulted in therapeutically-relevant plasma RISP and 9-OH-RISP concentrations (18+/-2.6 ng/ml), and significantly increased erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3, +22%, p=0.0003) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3, +18%, p=0.01) composition, and increased PFC DHA composition (+7%, p=0.03) in rats maintained on the ALA+ diet. In contrast, chronic RISP did not alter erythrocyte or PFC omega-3 fatty acid composition in rats maintained on the ALA- diet. Chronic RISP treatment did not alter erythrocyte or PFC arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) composition. These data suggest that chronic RISP treatment significantly augments ALA-DHA biosynthesis, and preferentially increases peripheral and central membrane omega-3 fatty acid composition. Augmented omega-3 fatty acid biosynthesis and membrane composition represents a novel mechanism of action that may contribute in part to the efficacy of RISP in the treatment of SZ.",M3
18986658,"Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency during perinatal development increases serotonin turnover in the prefrontal cortex and decreases midbrain tryptophan hydroxylase-2 expression in adult female rats: dissociation from estrogenic effects.A dysregulation in central serotonin neurotransmission and omega-3 fatty acid deficiency have been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression. To determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency on indices of serotonin neurotransmission in the adult rat brain, female rats were fed diets with or without the omega-3 fatty acid precursor alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) during perinatal (E0-P90), post-weaning (P21-P90), and post-pubescent (P60-130) development. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats and OVX rats with cyclic estrogen treatment were also examined. Serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) content, and fatty acid composition were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH-2), serotonin transporter, and 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor mRNA expression were determined in the midbrain. ALA deficiency during perinatal (-62%, p=0.0001), post-weaning (-34%, p=0.0001), and post-pubertal (-10%, p=0.0001) development resulted in a graded reduction in adult PFC docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) composition. Relative to controls, perinatal DHA-deficient rats exhibited significantly lower PFC 5-HT content (-65%, p=0.001), significant greater 5-HIAA content (+15%, p=0.046), and a significant greater 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio (+73%, p=0.001). Conversely, post-weaning DHA-deficient rats exhibited significantly greater PFC 5-HT content (+12%, p=0.03), no change in 5-HIAA content, and a significantly smaller 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio (-9%, p=0.01). Post-pubertal DHA-deficient and OXV rats did not exhibit significant alterations in PFC 5-HT or 5-HIAA content. Only perinatal DHA-deficient rats exhibited a significant reduction in midbrain TPH-2 mRNA expression (-29%, p=0.03). These preclinical data support a causal link between perinatal omega-3 fatty acid deficiency and reduced central serotonin synthesis in adult female rats that is independent of ovarian hormones including estrogen.",M3
18951003,"Omega-3 PUFA: good or bad for prostate cancer?INTRODUCTION: The objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate quantitatively the associations between intake or status of omega-3 polyunsaturated (omega-3 PUFA) fatty acids and occurrence of prostate cancer in observational studies in humans. METHODS: We combined risk estimates across studies using random-effects models. RESULTS: The combined estimate showed an increased risk of prostate cancer in men with a high intake or blood level of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) (combined relative risk (RR) 1.36; 95% CI 1.08-1.70). The association is stronger in the case-control studies (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.04-3.25) than in the prospective studies (RR 1.10; 0.91-1.32). Ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were not significantly associated with prostate cancer. DISCUSSION: The association between high intake of ALA and prostate cancer is of concern and needs further study. However, the fact that the prospective studies do not show a clear association makes a true effect of intake of ALA on prostate cancer less likely.",M3
18936216,"Increased elongase and desaturase gene expression with stearidonic acid enriched diet does not enhance long-chain (n-3) content of seawater Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) can produce (n-3) long-chain (LC)-PUFA when fed biosynthetic precursors. This has potential for developing sustainable aquafeeds. Echium oil (EO) is rich in stearidonic acid [SDA; 18:4(n-3)] and bypasses the initial Delta6 desaturase (FAD6) step in the (n-3) LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway. EO was fed to seawater Atlantic salmon for 12 wk and compared with fish fed a diet containing canola oil (CO), a source of alpha-linolenic acid [<e>ALA</e>; 18:3(n-3)] or fish oil (FO) that provides (n-3) LC-PUFA. Fatty acid (FA) composition of liver, white muscle, and whole fish was measured to show whether dietary precursors were endogenously biosynthesized to LC-PUFA. Gene expression of liver FA elongase and FAD5 was upregulated in EO fish compared with FO fish. Furthermore, dietary precursors affected the FA concentrations of direct biosynthetic products in all tissues. The increased gene expression in the EO fish was reflected by an increased FA concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] in the liver compared with the CO fish. However, the high concentrations of (n-3) LC-PUFA found in seawater Atlantic salmon fed diets rich in FO were not attained via biosynthesis from precursors (ALA or SDA) in diets.",M3
18802197,"Perinatal n-3 fatty acid deficiency selectively reduces myo-inositol levels in the adult rat PFC: an in vivo (1)H-MRS study.To investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acid deficiency on phosphatidylinositol signaling in brain, myo-inositol (mI) concentrations were determined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of omega-3 fatty acid deficient rats by in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). To generate graded deficits in PFC docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (DHA) composition, perinatal and postweaning alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) (<e>ALA</e>) deficiency models were used. Adult male rats were scanned in a 7T Bruker Biospec system and a (1)H-MRS spectrum acquired from the bilateral medial PFC. Rats were then challenged with SKF83959, a selective agonist at phosphoinositide (PI)-coupled dopamine D(1) receptors. Postmortem PFC fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography. Relative to controls, PFC DHA composition was significantly reduced in adult postweaning (-27%) and perinatal (-65%) ALA-deficiency groups. Basal PFC mI concentrations were significantly reduced in the perinatal deficiency group (-21%, P = 0.001), but not in the postweaning deficiency group (-1%, P = 0.86). Among all rats, DHA composition was positively correlated with mI concentrations and the mI/creatine (Cr) ratio. SKF83959 challenge significantly increased mI concentrations only in the perinatal deficiency group (+16%, P = 0.02). These data demonstrate that perinatal deficits in cortical DHA accrual significantly and selectively reduce mI concentrations and augment receptor-generated mI synthesis.",M3

Sesamin/episesamin (hereafter named sesamin) was included at 0.58 g/100 g diet. The oil used in the feed was either a mixture of linseed and sunflower oils (6:4, by vol) or 100% linseed oil. Addition of sesamin increased the percentages of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in white muscle phospholipid and triacylglycerol fraction by up to 37% but the fatty acids in red muscle and liver were not affected. The expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARalpha was significantly down regulated in the liver of the fish fed sesamin and mixed oil diet (P &lt; 0.05). Sesamin and episesamin were detected in liver and muscle tissues of the fish that had been fed sesamin. Fish fed sesamin had elevated levels of total cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and EROD activity in the liver, indicating an induction of CYP1A in this tissue. Our conclusion was that supplementation of fish feed with sesamin increased the proportions of DHA in the white muscle.",M3
18689552,"Bioavailability of alpha-linolenic acid in subjects after ingestion of three different forms of flaxseed.BACKGROUND: Dietary flaxseed may have significant health-related benefits due to its high content of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). However, before extensive work can be undertaken in clinical populations to determine its efficacy, basic information on ALA bioavailability from flaxseed and the physiological effects of its ingestion need to be examined. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the bioavailability of ALA when the flaxseed was ingested in the form of whole seed, milled seed or as flaxseed oil. DESIGN: The flaxseed components (30 g of seed or 6 g of ALA in the oil) were baked into muffins for delivery over a 3 month test period in healthy male and female subjects. RESULTS: Flaxseed ingestion over a 1 month period resulted in significant (P = 0.005) increases in plasma ALA levels in the flaxseed oil and the milled flaxseed supplemented groups. The former group had significantly (P = 0.004) higher ALA levels than the milled flaxseed group. The subjects supplemented with whole flaxseed did not achieve a significant (P &gt; 0.05) increase in plasma ALA levels. An additional two months of flaxseed ingestion did not achieve significantly higher levels of plasma ALA in any of the groups. However, no significant increase was detected in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels in any of the flax-fed groups. There were no changes in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides or in platelet aggregation at any time point in any of the groups. Subjects in all of the groups exhibited some symptoms of gastro-intestinal discomfort during the early stages of the study but these disappeared in the oil and milled seed groups. However, compliance was a problem in the whole flaxseed group. CONCLUSION: In summary, ingestion of flax oil and milled flaxseed delivered significant levels of ALA to the plasma whereas whole flaxseed did not. Whole seed and oil preparations induced adverse gastrointestinal effects within 4 weeks and these were severe enough to induce the withdrawal of some subjects from these two groups. No one withdrew from the group that ingested milled flaxseed and, therefore, may represent a good form of flaxseed to avoid serious side-effects and still provide significant increases in ALA to the body.",M3
18657178,"Anticonvulsant effects of linolenic acid are unrelated to brain phospholipid cell membrane compositions.PURPOSE: Recent studies have revealed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anticonvulsive properties. Clinical trials using PUFAs reported conflicting results. It was suggested that PUFAs have anticonvulsant effects via modifications of brain phospholipids. Moreover, some authors suggested that the effect of the ketogenic diet (KD) leads to a high PUFA content. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anticonvulsant properties of a mixture containing alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and linolenic acid (LA). METHODS: Four-week-old male Wistar rats were fed one of the following diets for 30 days: KD, standard diet, and standard diet with daily LA/ALA oral supplementation. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) threshold was used to assess the anticonvulsive effects of the diets. Nutritional status was monitored by body composition evaluation. Fatty acids composition of both plasma and brain phospholipids were also assessed. RESULTS: Animals fed the KD and those who had the daily LA/ALA supplementation exhibited an increase in PTZ threshold. The animals did not show any modification of body composition or brain phospholipid composition. The plasma fatty acids composition was modified by KD and LA/ALA. A decrease in arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations was observed in both the KD and LA/ALA groups, while an increase in eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and ALA concentrations was only observed in the LA/ALA group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that LA/ALA supplementation exerts anticonvulsive properties comparable to KD. Nutritional status can not explain the anticonvulsive effects of PUFAs supplementation. Brain phospholipids were not different within groups. The anticonvulsive effects of LA supplementation seem to be unrelated to brain phospholipid composition.",M3
18562792,"Dietary eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are more effective than alpha-linolenic acid in improving insulin sensitivity in rats.In the present study, we investigated whether long-term administration of high dose of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is able to mimic the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or a mixture of both with respect to insulin sensitivity in male Wistar rats. Furthermore, we intended to test whether these n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reveal differential effects on glucose and insulin levels. As a result, plasma glucose and insulin levels were lowered by 35 and 38%, respectively, in the EPA and DHA group compared to the ALA group. Insulin sensitivity was substantially improved, as indicated by a 60% decreased HOMA index after an 8-week EPA and DHA administration, as compared to the effect observed for feeding ALA. However, insulin sensitivity did not differ between animals of the EPA and the DHA group. These results demonstrate that ALA intake at the expense of EPA and DHA in a diet high in n-3 fatty acids does not represent an alternative to raising oily fish consumption with regard to insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, a differential effect of the members of the n-3 family was shown for ALA compared to EPA and DHA, but EPA and DHA revealed comparable effects on insulin sensitivity.",M3

18460483,"Flaxseed and cardiovascular risk factors: results from a double blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: Flaxseed is a rich source of alpha linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), fiber and lignans, making it a potentially attractive functional food for modulating cardiovascular risk. We studied the effects of flaxseed on markers of cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic adults. METHODS: Sixty-two men and post-menopausal women with pre-study low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between 130 and 200 mg/dl were randomized to 40g/day of ground flaxseed-containing baked products or matching wheat bran products for 10 weeks while following a low fat, low cholesterol diet. Fasting lipoproteins, measures of insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and safety were assessed at 0, 5 and 10 weeks. RESULTS: Flaxseed was well-tolerated, and increased serum levels of ALA (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to wheat, flaxseed significantly reduced LDL-C at 5 weeks (-13%, p &lt; 0.005), but not at 10 weeks (-7%, p = 0.07). Flaxseed reduced lipoprotein a (Lp[a]) by a net of 14% (p = 0.02), and reduced the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index by 23.7% (p = 0.03) compared to wheat at 10 weeks, but did not affect markers of inflammation (IL-6, Hs-CRP) or oxidative stress (ox LDL, urinary isoprostanes) at any time points. In men, flaxseed reduced HDL-C concentrations by a net of 16% (p = 0.03) and 9% (p = 0.05) at 5 and 10 weeks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ground flaxseed has a modest but short lived LDL-C lowering effect, yet reduces Lp(a) and improves insulin sensitivity in hyperlipidemic adults. The HDL-C lowering effect of flaxseed in men warrants additional study.",M3
18391475,"High dose flaxseed oil supplementation may affect fasting blood serum glucose management in human type 2 diabetics.Type 2 diabetes is characterized partially by elevated fasting blood serum glucose and insulin concentrations and the percentage of hemoglobin as HbA1c. It was hypothesized that each of blood glucose and its co-factors insulin and HbA1c and would show a more favorable profile as the result of flaxseed oil supplementation. Patients were recruited at random from a population pool responding to a recruitment advertisement in the local newspaper and 2 area physicians. Completing the trial were 10 flaxseed oil males, 8 flaxseed oil females, 8 safflower (placebo) oil males and 6 safflower oil females. Patients visited on two pre-treatment occasions each three months apart (visits 1 and 2). At visit 2 subjects were randomly assigned in double blind fashion and in equal gender numbers to take flaxseed oil or safflower oil for three further months until visit 3. Oil consumption in both groups was approximately 10 g/d. <e>ALA</e> intake in the intervention group was approximately 5.5 g/d. Power was 0.80 to see a difference of 1 mmol of glucose /L using 12 subjects per group with a p &lt; 0.05. Flaxseed oil had no impact on fasting blood serum glucose, insulin or HbA1c levels. It is concluded that high doses of flaxseed oil have no effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetics.",M3
18367385,"Effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on estimated desaturase activities during a controlled dietary intervention.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Direct measurement of desaturase activities are difficult to obtain in humans. Consequently, surrogate measures of desaturase activity (estimated desaturase activities) have been frequently used in observational studies, and estimated Delta(9)- (or stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD)), Delta(6)- and Delta(5)-desaturase activities have been associated with cardiometabolic disease. Data on how the markers of desaturase activities are modified by changes in dietary fat quality are lacking and therefore warrant examination. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a two-period (three weeks) strictly controlled cross-over study, 20 subjects (six women and 14 men) consumed a diet high in saturated fat (SAT-diet) and a rapeseed oil diet (RO-diet), rich in oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor to product FA ratios in serum cholesteryl esters and phospholipids. The estimated SCD [16:1 n-7/16:0] and Delta(6)-desaturase [20:3 n-6/18:2 n-6] was significantly higher while Delta(5)-desaturase [20:4 n-6/20:3 n-6] was significantly lower in the SAT-diet (P&lt;0.001 for all), compared to the RO-diet. The serum proportions of palmitic, stearic, palmitoleic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids were significantly higher in the SAT-diet while the proportions of LA and ALA were significantly higher in the RO-diet. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that surrogate measures of desaturase activities change as a consequence of an alteration in dietary fat quality. Both the [16:1/16:0]-ratio and 16:1 seem to reflect changes in saturated fat intake and may be useful markers of saturated fat intake in Western countries.",M3
18275619,"Chronic effects of a high-fat diet enriched with virgin olive oil and a low-fat diet enriched with alpha-linolenic acid on postprandial endothelial function in healthy men.Traditional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with endothelial dysfunction. The vascular endothelium plays a key role in local vascular tone regulation and can be modulated by dietary fat. We propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), all fractions are % of energy); a Mediterranean diet, rich in MUFA ( &lt; 10 % SFA, 24 % MUFA and 0.4% ALA); a low-fat diet enriched in ALA ( &lt; 10% SFA, 12% MUFA and 2% ALA). At the end of each dietary period all subjects underwent a postprandial study. Plasma concentrations of lipid parameters, soluble intercellular cell-adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), nitrates and nitrites (NOx) and endothelial function studied by laser Doppler were examined at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response was greater 4 h after the ingestion of the MUFA-rich diet than after the SFA or ALA low-fat diets (P = 0.031). The 4 h postprandial plasma sVCAM-1 levels were lower after the MUFA meals than after the ALA low-fat diet (P = 0.043). The bioavailability of NOx was higher following the MUFA diet than after the SFA and ALA low-fat diets (P = 0.027). We found no differences in the other parameters measured. Chronic ingestion of a Mediterranean diet avoids the postprandial deterioration of endothelial function associated with Westernised diets in healthy individuals.",M3
18268213,"Topical omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for treatment of dry eye.OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of topical application of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and linoleic acid (LA) for dry eye treatment. METHODS: Formulations containing ALA, LA, combined ALA and LA, or vehicle alone, were applied to dry eyes induced in mice. Corneal fluorescein staining and the number and maturation of corneal CD11b(+) cells were determined by a masked observer in the different treatment groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify expression of inflammatory cytokines in the cornea and conjunctiva. RESULTS: Dry eye induction significantly increased corneal fluorescein staining; CD11b(+) cell number and major histocompatibility complex Class II expression; corneal IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression; and conjunctival IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, interferon gamma, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 expression. Treatment with ALA significantly decreased corneal fluorescein staining compared with both vehicle and untreated controls. Additionally, ALA treatment was associated with a significant decrease in CD11b(+) cell number, expression of corneal IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha, and conjunctival TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Topical ALA treatment led to a significant decrease in dry eye signs and inflammatory changes at both cellular and molecular levels. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Topical application of ALA omega-3 fatty acid may be a novel therapy to treat the clinical signs and inflammatory changes accompanying dry eye syndrome.",M3
18097614,"Intercalated disk remodeling in delta-sarcoglycan-deficient hamsters fed with an alpha-linolenic acid-enriched diet.Cardiomyocyte intercalated disks of delta-sarcoglycan-deficient cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMPHs) exhibit a pathological accumulation of the N-cadherin/catenin complex. CMPHs fed with an alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-enriched diet (CMPH/FS) display an extended longevity compared to those fed with a standard diet (CMPH/PT) owing to, among others, the amelioration of both cardiac tissue structure and myocardial function. The present investigation was aimed at evaluating whether and to what extent the ALA-enriched diet affects the remodeling of CMPH cardiomyocyte intercalated disks and the expression of molecules, including N-cadherin, catenins and connexin 43 (CX43), involved in their organization. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression of N-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenin is significantly reduced in cardiomyocyte intercalated disks of CMPH/FS vs. CMPH/PT and is lowered to levels similar to those found in healthy hamsters (GSH/PT), as well as transmission electron microscopy indicated that the cardiomyocyte intercalated disk ultrastructure is also re-established in CMPH/FS. In addition, the delocalization of CX43 as well as the presence of gap junctions were detectable at the lateral plasmamembrane of CMPH/FS cardiomyocytes, while the expression of myocardial CX43 was markedly reduced in both CMPH/PT and CMPH/FS, as compared to GSH/PT. Collectively, the present results demonstrate a substantial effect of an ALA-enriched diet on cardiomyocyte intercalated disk structure and molecular composition and further supports the beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the prevention of potentially dangerous arrhythmias in cardiac diseases.",M3
18155022,"Modulation of the atrial specific Kv1.5 channel by the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid.Epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies suggest that the cardioprotective effect of fish intake is mainly due to the antiarrhythmic properties of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which modulate ion currents. Emerging evidences point to similar effects of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), a vegetable n-3 PUFA, but much less is known about its effects on the specific cardiac ion channels. Using electrophysiology, protein biochemistry and fluorescence anisotropy measurements, we tested the effects of ALA on the atrial specific Kv1.5 channel. In stably transfected Ltk(-) cells, ALA blocked Kv1.5 channels in a time- and voltage-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 3.7+/-0.3 microM. ALA at 2.5 microM inhibited the Kv1.5 current, shifted the midpoint of the activation curve by -8.8+/-4.3 mV (p&lt;0.05), accelerated the activation kinetics of Kv1.5 due to a negative shift in its voltage dependency and slowed its deactivation process. Marine n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic (EPA and DHA) acids, but not ALA, reduced the steady-state levels of Kv1.5 protein. DHA, but not ALA, increased the cell membrane order parameter. These results demonstrate that ALA directly blocks atria-specific Kv1.5 channels without modifying their expression or the bilayer order. Together, these effects suggest that the antiarrhythmic potential of diets enriched with plant-derived n-3 PUFA result, in part, from direct effects on cardiac ion channels.",M3
18070874,"A 49-kDa mini-lipoxygenase from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 retains catalytically complete functionality.Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is one of the few prokaryotes harboring a lipoxygenase (LOX) gene. The sequence resides in an open reading frame encoding a fusion protein of a catalase-like hemoprotein with an unusually short LOX (approximately 49 kDa) at the C terminus. The recombinant mini-LOX contains a non-heme iron in the active site and is highly active with linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids (which occur naturally in Anabaena) giving the respective 9R-hydroperoxides, the mirror image of the 9S-LOX products of plants. Using stereospecifically labeled [11-(3)H]linoleic acids we show that reaction is catalyzed via a typical antarafacial relationship of initial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation. The mini-LOX oxygenated C16/C18:2-phosphatidylcholine with 9R specificity, suggesting a  tail first  mode of fatty acid binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of an active site <e>Ala</e> (Ala215), typically conserved as Gly in R-LOX, revealed that substitution with Gly retained 9R specificity, whereas the larger Val substitution switched oxygenation to 13S, implying that Ala215 represents the functional equivalent of the Gly in other R-LOX. Metabolism studies using a synthetic fatty acid with extended double bond conjugation, 9E,11Z,14Z-20:3omega6, showed that the mini-LOX can control oxygenation two positions further along the fatty acid carbon chain. We conclude that the mini-LOX, despite lacking the beta-barrel domain and much additional sequence, is catalytically complete. Interestingly, animal and plant LOX, which undoubtedly share a common ancestor, are related in sequence only in the catalytic domain; it is possible that the prokaryotic LOX represents a common link and that the beta-barrel domain was then acquired independently in the animal and plant kingdoms.",M3
18075218,"Interaction between alpha-linolenic acid-enriched oil and ACE inhibitor concerning the decrease in blood pressure in SHR.Alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) has been reported to exhibit an antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is also an antihypertensive agent. We evaluated the interaction between ALA-enriched oil (test oil) and ACEI concerning the decrease in blood pressure by administering test oil, ACEI, or test oil + ACEI to 7-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). After administration, the systolic pressure decreased significantly in all groups compared with the level before administration, but the diastolic pressure decreased significantly only in the test oil + ACEI group. No significant difference was noted in systolic or diastolic pressure among the 3 groups. These results suggest that the interaction between ALA-enriched oil and ACEI is limited. Our study suggested the safety of consuming foods containing a large amount of ALA in combination with hypotensive agents.",M3
17912567,"Estradiol favors the formation of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) from alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.Whether neurosteroids regulate the synthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain cells is unknown. We examined the influence of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) on the capacity of SH-SY5Y cells supplemented with alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Cells were incubated for 24 or 72 h with ALA added alone or in combination with E2 (ALA + E2). Fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (EtnGpl) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). Incubation for 24 h with ALA alone increased EPA and DPA in EtnGpl, by 330 and 430% compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001) and DHA by only 10% (P &lt; 0.05). Although DHA increased by 30% (P &lt; 0.001) in ALA + E2-treated cells, the difference between the ALA and ALA + E2 treatments were not significant after 24 h (Anova-1, Fisher's test). After 72 h, EPA, DPA and DHA further increased in EtnGpl and PtdCho of cells supplemented with ALA or ALA + E2. Incubation for 72 h with ALA + E2 specifically increased EPA (+34% in EtnGpl, P &lt; 0.001) and DPA (+15%, P &lt; 0.001) compared to ALA alone. Thus, SH-SY5Y cells produced membrane EPA, DPA and DHA from supplemental ALA. The formation of DHA was limited, even in the presence of E2. E2 significantly favored EPA and DPA production in cells grown for 72 h. Enhanced synthesis of ALA-elongation products in neuroblastoma cells treated with E2 supports the hypothesis that neurosteroids could modulate the metabolism of PUFA.",M3
17955332,"Rapid declines in coronary heart disease mortality in Eastern Europe are associated with increased consumption of oils rich in alpha-linolenic acid.During the 1980's, opposing time trends were observed in coronary heart disease (CHD) rates between Eastern and Western European countries. In all former socialistic economic countries, CHD was uniformly increasing or stable, but a steady decline in CHD was observed in Western European countries. Surprisingly, during the 1990's CHD mortality substantially decreased in some Eastern European countries but not in others. These changes were accompanied by major shifts in food consumption, including the type of vegetable oils used by the population. There are two major vegetable oils consumed in Eastern Europe (rapeseed and sunflower) that differ greatly in their content of n-3 fatty acids, specifically alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Low ALA intake has been associated with risk of fatal CHD and sudden cardiac death. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in CHD in eleven Eastern European countries to identify whether national changes in vegetable oil consumption after 1990 were associated with changes in CHD mortality rates. Our data show that countries which experienced an increase in ALA consumption also experienced a substantial decline in CHD mortality. These results were consistent in men and women. We hypothesize that the decline in CHD mortality observed in Eastern Europe can be attributed, in part, to changes in ALA consumption.",M3
17898500,"Lowering systolic blood pressure and increases in vasodilator levels in SHR with oral alpha-linolenic acid administration.The present study attempted to clarify the antihypertensive effect and its mechanism when alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is administered orally. For this purpose, 1 mL of flaxseed oil, which is rich in ALA, and high oleic safflower oil was administered orally to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of a control and an ALA group on days 1 and 5. Systolic blood pressure was measured on day 1, and blood and liver were collected on day 5. Four hours after the oral administration on day 1, systolic blood pressure of the ALA group was lower than that of the control group. Levels of plasma vasodilators, such as prostaglandin I(2) metabolite, nitric oxide metabolites, and bradykinin, in the ALA group were significantly higher than those in the control group, but levels of vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and thromboxane A(2) metabolite, did not differ significantly. It is known that bradykinin induces prostaglandin I(2) and nitric oxide. The present study shows that ALA reduced the systolic blood pressure of SHR, and its mechanism may be related to increases of prostaglandin I(2) and nitric oxide through bradykinin stimulation.",M3
17898501,"Antihypertensive effect and safety of dietary alpha-linolenic acid in subjects with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension.We investigated the antihypertensive effect and safety of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) in human subjects. In Experiment 1, subjects with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension ingested bread containing 14 g of common blended oil (control oil) or ALA-enriched oil for 12 weeks. The test oil contained 2.6g/14 g of ALA. The subjects ingested strictly controlled meals during the study period. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the ALA group than in the control group after ingestion of the test diet for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the ALA group than in the control group after ingestion of the test diet for 12 weeks. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the safety of high intake of ALA (7.8 g/d), particularly its effects on oxidation in the body and blood coagulation. Normotensive, high-normotensive and mildly hypertensive subjects ate bread that contained 42 g of the control oil or the test oil for 4 weeks. No significant difference was noted in the lipid peroxide level, high-sensitive C-reactive protein level, plasma prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time between the two groups. No abnormal changes were noted after test diet ingestion on blood test or urinalysis, and no adverse event considered to have been induced by the test oil was observed in Experiment 1 and 2. These results suggest that ALA have an antihypertensive effect with no adverse effect in subjects with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension.",M3
17892040,"[Biology of essential fatty acids (EFA)]Essential Fatty Acids (EFA), are unsaturated fatty acids not produced by human being, but essential for proper functioning of the human body. To EFA-s belongs: linoleic acid (LA) (18:2,cis detla(9,12), omega6)--precursor o f gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (18:3,cisA6,9,12, )6) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>)(18:3,cisdelta(9, 12, 15), omega3)--product of dehydrogenation of linoleic acid (LA). Most important EFA is gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)--18 carbons, one-carboxylic, non-branched fatty acid with 3 double cis-bonds (the last is situated by 6-th carbon from methylic end). The diet devoided of EFA leads to decreased growth, skin and kidney injury and infertility. Modern research of GLA and others EFA's is concerned mainly on therapeutic impact on the inflammatory process. The biogenic amines, cytokines, prostaglandins, tromboxanes and leukotrienes are the main inflammatory mediators. The last three are described with the common name eicosanoides (eico-twenty). Eicosanoides are synthesized from 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acids: dihomo-gamma-linoleic (DGLA) (20:3, cis delta(8,11,14), omega6), arachidonic acid (AA-20:4, cis delta(5,8,11,14), omega6), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-20:5, cis delta(5,8,11,14,17, omega3). Derivatives of gamma and gamma-linolenic acids regulate the inflammatory process, through their opposed activity. PG2, leucotrien C4 and tromboxan A2 have the strongest proinflammatory action. Derivatives of alpha-linolenic acid 15-HETE and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) have weak pro-inflammatory action, or even anti-inflammatory (PGE1), and additionally, they inhibit the transformation of arachidonic acid (AA) to leukotriens. delta6-desaturase (transformes linolenic acid into gamma-linolenic acid by making additional double bond) is the slowest step of the fatty acid metabolism. It's activity is impaired by many physiological and pathologic factors and leads to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) deficiency. The gamma-linolenic acid supplementation in diet allows to omitt the inefficient delta6-desaturase system which has an effect in rising of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA) and their derivatives. This article describes biology of essential fatty acids and particularly the role of gamma-linolenic acid.",M3
17898498,"The role of consumption of alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in human metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes--a mini-review.The human metabolic syndrome and its frequent sequela, type 2 diabetes are epidemic around the world. Alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>, 18:3 n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) consumption ameliorates some of these epidemics' features thus leading one to question if consumption of EPA and DHA, and their metabolic precursor ALA reduce the conversion of metabolic syndrome to type 2 diabetes and reduce the major cause of death in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes-myocardial infarction. Contributing to myocardial infarction are metabolic syndrome's features of dyslipidemia (including elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c), oxidation, inflammation, hypertension, glucose intolerance, overweight and obesity. Inflammation, glucose and lipid levels are variously influenced by disturbances in various adipocytokines which are in turn positively impacted by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption. Type 2 diabetes has all these features though elevated total cholesterol and LDL-c are rarer. It is concluded that EPA and DHA consumption significantly benefits metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes primarily in terms of dyslipidemia (particularly hypertriglyceridemia) and platelet aggregation with their impact on blood pressure, glucose control, inflammation and oxidation being less established. There is some evidence that EPA and/or DHA consumption, but no published evidence that ALA reduces conversion of metabolic syndrome to type 2 diabetes and reduces death rates due to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. ALA's only published significance appears to be platelet aggregation reduction in type 2 diabetes.",M3
17697863,"Adiponectin levels are reduced, independent of polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene, after supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid among healthy adults.Our first aim was to determine whether an isocaloric intervention using alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) in the form of flaxseed oil would alter adiponectin levels among overweight, otherwise healthy, males and females, and our second aim was to test for any potential modification of this intervention by 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (276 and 45) in the adiponectin gene. Subjects included healthy adult males and females (approximately 81% female; average age, 38 years) with increased waist circumference (mean, 99 cm) and body mass index (mean, 30 kg/m(2)) who were free of chronic disease, not taking medications, and sedentary. Subjects met weekly with a registered dietician for 8 weeks. The control subjects (n = 27) were instructed not to alter their habitual diet and the ALA group (n = 30) was instructed to follow an enriched ALA diet by using flaxseed oil capsules (increasing ALA to 5% of total energy intake) and to lower their dietary fat consumption by a commensurate amount. Diets were analyzed using the Food Intake and Analysis System (v. 3.0, University of Texas School of Public Health, 1998). Fasting blood samples were obtained before and after the 8-week intervention. We found significant decreases (P = .02) in adiponectin (10.12 microg/mL pre, 9.23 microg/mL post) in the ALA group as compared with the control group (7.93 microg/mL pre, 8.10 microg/mL post) after the intervention. We also saw a decline in adiponectin in all genotype groups with the greatest decline among those carrying the rare T allele of single nucleotide polymorphism 276. There were no significant changes in fasting insulin, glucose, or quantitative insulin sensitivity check index values as a result of this intervention. In conclusion, this study suggests that supplementing with ALA for 8 weeks may lower adiponectin levels among healthy individuals, and this effect appears to be independent of polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene. Although the change in adiponectin in response to the omega-3 fatty acids was not accompanied by any change in glucose, insulin, or quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, long-term implications of such a decrease should be considered in future studies.",M3
17716867,"Alpha-linolenic acid attenuates high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells via PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway.OBJECTIVE: High glucose-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the acceleration of atherosclerosis associated with diabetes. We hypothesized that alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) might attenuate high glucose-induced apoptosis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: HUVECs were cultured at 5.5 and 33 mmol/L for 72 h. ALA with different concentrations was added with defatted bovine serum albumin as a carrier for 18 h before incubation with high glucose. RESULTS: Exposure of HUVECs to high glucose media for 72 h significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells compared with normal glucose control, as evaluated by flow cytometry and terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay. Pretreatment with low concentrations of ALA (10, 50, and 100 micromol/L) significantly attenuated high glucose-induced apoptosis of HUVECs, but increasing ALA to 200 micromol/L exerted the opposite effect. Furthermore, high glucose reduced phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with subsequent nitric oxide production, whereas ALA treatment attenuated the reduction caused by high glucose. Pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase kinase inhibitor LY294002 and eNOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-arginine methyl ester eliminated ALA' antiapoptotic effect. CONCLUSION: ALA exerts an antiapoptotic effect by the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway in HUVECs exposed to high glucose and thus may represent a candidate therapeutic agent for diabetic cardiovascular complications.",M3

Adiponectin is a hormone specifically secreted by adipocytes and considered to have anti-atherogenic properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: We examined the effect of increased dietary intake of ALA on plasma concentration of adiponectin. METHODS: Thirty-five non-diabetic, dyslipidemic men, 38-71 years old, were randomly allocated to take either 15 ml of flaxseed oil rich in ALA (8.1 g/day; n = 18), or 15 ml of safflower oil per day, containing the equivalent n-6 fatty acid (11.2 g/day linoleic acid, LA; n = 17) (control group). The intervention period lasted for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Plasma levels of adiponectin did not change after the increase in dietary intake of ALA in the flaxseed oil supplementation group, compared to the control group. No changes in body mass index, serum lipid concentrations, LDL density, or plasma TNF-alpha were found in the flaxseed oil versus the control group.

17667849,"Neonatal growth rate and development of mice raised on milk transgenically enriched with omega-3 fatty acids.The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status of the neonatal brain has been associated with cognitive capability in mice. Previously, transgenic mice expressing the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) n-3 fatty acid (FA) desaturase gene under the control of a lactation-induced mammary gland promoter were found to produce milk containing significantly elevated levels of alpha-linolenic (<e>ALA</e>) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid. In this study, the preweaning growth rate and development of mouse pups consuming elevated n-3 PUFA milk produced by transgenic dams were evaluated using the Wahlsten observational test battery and the object novelty preference test. Brains were collected at weaning and analyzed for FA composition. Pups nursed on transgenic dams had earlier eye opening, higher visual placement scores, and 1.6-fold more docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their brains compared with pups raised on wildtype dams. There was no significant effect of milk treatment (transgenic versus control) on other developmental parameters or novelty preference behavior. The pups consuming the elevated n-3 PUFA transgenic milk had slower preweaning growth rates such that pups reared on wildtype dams producing control milk were heavier than pups reared on transgenic dams producing high n-3 PUFA milk by postnatal day 18. This transgenic model enables the provision of a high n-3 PUFA lactational environment independent of maternal diet or gestational FA status.",M3

17622276,"Extremely limited synthesis of long chain polyunsaturates in adults: implications for their dietary essentiality and use as supplements.There is considerable interest in the potential impact of several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in mitigating the significant morbidity and mortality caused by degenerative diseases of the cardiovascular system and brain. Despite this interest, confusion surrounds the extent of conversion in humans of the parent PUFA, linoleic acid or alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), to their respective long-chain PUFA products. As a result, there is uncertainty about the potential benefits of ALA versus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Some of the confusion arises because although mammals have the necessary enzymes to make the long-chain PUFA from the parent PUFA, in vivo studies in humans show that asymptotically equal to 5% of ALA is converted to EPA and &lt;0.5% of ALA is converted to DHA. Because the capacity of this pathway is very low in healthy, nonvegetarian humans, even large amounts of dietary ALA have a negligible effect on plasma DHA, an effect paralleled in the omega6 PUFA by a negligible effect of dietary linoleic acid on plasma arachidonic acid. Despite this inefficient conversion, there are potential roles in human health for ALA and EPA that could be independent of their metabolism to DHA through the desaturation - chain elongation pathway.",M3
17546469,"Dietary lipids impacts on healthy ageing.Healthy ageing is gaining attention in the lipid nutrition field. As in vivo biomarkers of healthy ageing, we have evaluated the survival, learning/memory performance, and physical potencies in rodents fed a diet supplemented with high-linoleic acid (LNA, omega6) safflower oil or high-alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>, omega3) perilla oil for long periods. The results suggested that perilla oil with a low omega6/omega3 ratio is beneficial for healthy ageing. In order to address this issue further, we determined the survival of stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) rats fed a conventional rodent diet supplemented with 10% fat or oil. Survival was longer with omega3-rich oils compared with omega6-rich oils. However, some kinds of vegetable oils and hydrogenated oils shortened the survival of SHRSP rats to an unusual degree (ca. 40% compared with that of omega6-rich oil) that could not be accounted for by the fatty acid and phytosterol composition of the oils. The observed decrease in platelet counts was associated with pathological changes in the kidney and other organs. Dihydro-vitamin K1 is proposed as a likely candidate as a stroke-stimulating factor in hydrogenated oils. Thus, factors other than fatty acids (omega6/omega3 balance) and phytosterols must be taken into account when fats and oils are evaluated in relation to healthy ageing.",M3
17564735,"Moderate dietary intake of myristic and alpha-linolenic acids increases lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in humans.Cholesterol removal from tissues into HDL depends on the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; E.C. 2.3.1.43) that is associated with lower cardiovascular diseases risk. HDL cholesterol concentration and LCAT activity can be modulated by dietary fatty acids. Original data with substrate models have shown a positive effect of myristic acid (MA) on the esterification rate of cholesterol. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of moderate intakes of MA associated with recommended intake of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) on LCAT activity in humans. Two experimental diets were tested for 3 months each. Diet 1-MA 1.2% of total energy (TE) and ALA 0.9% TE, diet 2-MA 1.8% and ALA 0.9% TE; a control diet (MA 1.2% and ALA 0.4% TE) was given 3 months before diet 1 and diet 2. The endogenous activity of LCAT was determined at completion of each diet. Compared with the control diet (13.2 +/- 3.1 micromol CE/(L x h)), LCAT activity increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) with diet 1 (24.2 +/- 3.6 micromol CE/(L x h)) and diet 2 (33.3 +/- 7.4 micromol CE/(L x h)); the increase observed with diet 2 was significantly (P &lt; 0.001) greater than that due to diet 1. These results suggest that ALA (from rapeseed oil, mainly in sn-2 position) and MA (from dairy fat, mainly in sn-2 position) favor LCAT activity, by respective increases of 83 and 38%. When they are supplied together, a complementary effect was observed (average increase of 152%). Moreover, these observations were associated with a decrease of the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol. In conclusion, our results suggest that moderate supply of MA (1.8% TE) associated with the recommended intake of ALA (0.9% TE) contributes to improve LCAT activity.",M3
17536124,"Dietary linolenic acid intake is positively associated with five-year change in eye lens nuclear density.OBJECTIVE: Dietary fat may affect lens cell membrane composition and function, which are related to age-related cataract. The present study was designed to examine the associations between dietary fat and the change in nuclear lens opacification over five years. METHODS: Women aged 52 to 73 years without previously diagnosed cancer, diabetes and cataracts from the Boston, Massachusetts area were selected from the Nurses' Health Study cohort. Four hundred forty women participated in a baseline (1993-95) and a follow-up (1998-2000) eye examination. Intakes of total fat and selected fatty acids were calculated as the average intake from five food frequency questionnaires that were collected between 1980 and baseline. Change in the degree of nuclear density (opacification) was characterized by the difference between baseline and follow-up in pixel density at the central clear zone in the Scheimpflug slit image of the lens. RESULTS: Intake of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) was positively associated with change in nuclear density. The geometric mean nuclear density change was 16% greater in the highest quartile category of ALA intake than in the lowest quartile category (P for trend = 0.05). For women in the high tertile category of baseline nuclear lens opacification, the geometric mean change in the highest quartile category of ALA acid intake was 70% higher than the change in the lowest quartile category (P for trend = 0.01). There were no significant associations between other dietary fats and change in nuclear density. CONCLUSION: Higher ALA intake was associated with a greater age-related change in lens nuclear density.",M3
17542608,"Anti-inflammatory effect of alpha-linolenic acid and its mode of action through the inhibition of nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression via NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.Alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) isolated from Actinidia polygama fruits exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity with an unknown mechanism. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ALA on pharmacological and biochemical actions in inflammation, we examined the effect of ALA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in the murine macrophages cell line, RAW 264.7. We found that ALA has a strong inhibitory effect on the production of NO. ALA also inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene expressions induced by LPS. To explore the mechanisms associated with the inhibition of iNOS gene expression by ALA, we investigated its effect on LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Treatment with ALA reduced a translocation of NF-kappaB subunit and NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity. The activation of NF-kappaB was inhibited by prevention of the degradation of inhibitory factor-kappaBalpha. We also found that ALA inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In addition, the antinociceptive effect of ALA was also assessed by means of the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction test and Randall-Selitto assay. ALA (5 and 10 mg/kg) showed the potent antinociceptive effects in these animal models. Taken together, these results suggest that ALA downregulates inflammatory iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-alpha gene expressions through the blocking of NF-kappaB and MAPKs activations in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, which may be the mechanistic basis for the anti-inflammatory effect of ALA.",M3
17409318,"Competition between 24:5n-3 and <e>ALA</e> for Delta 6 desaturase may limit the accumulation of DHA in HepG2 cell membranes.The use of Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) twice in the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) suggests that this enzyme may play a key regulatory role in the synthesis and accumulation of DHA from ALA. We examined this using an in vitro model of fatty acid metabolism to measure the accumulation of the long-chain metabolites of ALA in HepG2 cell phospholipids. The accumulation of ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), and 24:5n-3 in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration of supplemented ALA over the range tested (1.8-72 microM). The accumulation of the post-D6D products of 22:5n-3, 24:6n-3 and DHA, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of &gt;18 microM ALA. Supplementation of HepG2 cells with preformed DHA revealed that, although the accumulation of DHA in cell phospholipids approached saturation, the level of DHA in cell phospholipids was significantly greater compared with the accumulation of DHA from ALA, indicating that the accumulation of DHA from ALA was not limited by incorporation. The parallel pattern of accumulation of 24:6n-3 and DHA in response to increasing concentrations of ALA suggests that the competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for D6D may contribute to the limited accumulation of DHA in cell membranes.",M3
17526653,"Long-term effect of dietary {alpha}-linolenic acid or decosahexaenoic acid on incorporation of decosahexaenoic acid in membranes and its influence on rat heart in vivo.The present study was designed to evaluate whether long-term intake of dietary alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), supplied as whole grain-extruded linseed, can increase endogenous production of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) in healthy adult rats and influence the heart rate (HR) and adrenergic response in the same way as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich diets. DHA enrichment was evaluated using FA analysis of tissue phospholipids after 8, 16, 24, and 32 wk of feeding in male Wistar rats randomly assigned to three dietary groups (n = 8 in each group): a reference fat diet (RFD), an ALA-rich (ALA) diet, and a DHA-rich (DHA) diet. At 1 wk before the animals were killed, under anesthesia, HR was measured from ECG recordings during an adrenergic stimulation challenge (n = 8). There was a significant increase of DHA in the cardiac membrane in the ALA group compared with the RFD group. DHA content in the cardiac membrane was approximately 10% in the ALA group vs. 20% in the DHA group and 4% in the RFD group. The cardiac FA profile was established after 2 mo and remained essentially unchanged thereafter. Regardless of the diet, DHA in the heart decreased with age. Nevertheless, DHA content in the heart remained at &gt;15% in the DHA group and remained greater in older rats fed the ALA diet than in younger RFD-fed rats. Basal HR decreased in the ALA group (395 +/- 24.9 beats/min) to a level between that of the DHA and RFD groups (375 +/- 26.4 and 407 +/- 36.7 beats/min, respectively). Both n-3 dietary intakes contribute to enhancement of the chronotropic response to adrenergic agonist stimulation. Regulation of HR by neurohumoral mediators may be controlled by lower content of DHA, e.g., by a dietary supply of extruded linseed (ALA).",M3
17284757,"alpha-Linolenic acid, Delta6-desaturase gene polymorphism, and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND: Delta(6)-Desaturase (FADS2) is the rate-limiting step in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthetic pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether the common deletion [T/-] in the promoter of FADS2 affects the PUFA biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) on myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: Case subjects (n =1694) with a first nonfatal acute MI were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in Costa Rica. PUFAs were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. Least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of the variant T/- allele was 48%. Eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Fasting plasma triacylglycerols by genotype were 2.08 mmol/L for TT, 2.16 mmol/L for T-, and 2.26 mmol/L for - - [ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele] (P = 0.03). The FADS2 deletion was not associated with MI and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue ALA and the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: The FADS2 deletion may prevent the conversion of ALA into very-long-chain PUFAs. However, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between ALA and MI among carriers of the variant. It is possible that, at current intakes of ALA, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. Further research in populations deficient in ALA intake is warranted.",M3
17374659,"Decreasing linoleic acid with constant alpha-linolenic acid in dietary fats increases (n-3) eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma phospholipids in healthy men.High linoleic acid (LA) intakes have been suggested to reduce alpha-linolenic acid [<e>ALA</e>, 18:3(n-3)] metabolism to eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20:5(n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22:6(n-3)], and favor high arachidonic acid [ARA, 20:4(n-6)]. We used a randomized cross-over study with men (n = 22) to compare the effect of replacing vegetable oils high in LA with oils low in LA in foods, while maintaining constant ALA, for 4 wk each, on plasma (n-3) fatty acids. Nonvegetable sources of fat, except fish and seafoods, were unrestricted. We determined plasma phospholipid fatty acids at wk 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and triglycerides, cholesterol, serum CRP, and IL-6, and platelet aggregation at wk 0, 4, and 8. LA and ALA intakes were 3.8 +/- 0.12% and 1.0 +/- 0.05%, and 10.5 +/- 0.53% and 1.1 +/- 0.06% energy with LA:ALA ratios of 4:0 and 10:1 during the low and high LA diets, respectively. The plasma phospholipid LA was higher and EPA was lower during the high than during the low LA diet period (P &lt; 0.001), but DHA declined over the 8-wk period (r = -0.425, P &lt; 0.001). The plasma phospholipid ARA:EPA ratios were (mean +/- SEM) 20.7 +/- 1.52 and 12.9 +/- 1.01 after 4 wk consuming the high or low LA diets, respectively (P &lt; 0.001); LA was inversely associated with EPA (r = -0.729, P &lt; 0.001) but positively associated with ARA:EPA (r = 0.432, P &lt; 0.001). LA intake did not influence ALA, ARA, DPA, DHA, or total, LDL or HDL cholesterol, CRP or IL-6, or platelet aggregation. In conclusion, high LA intakes decrease plasma phospholipid EPA and increase the ARA:EPA ratio, but do not favor higher ARA.",M3
17275274,"Failure of conjugated linoleic acid supplementation to enhance biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid from alpha-linolenic acid in healthy human volunteers.A rate-limiting step in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) formation from alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) involves peroxisomal oxidation of 24:6n-3 to DHA. The aim of the study was to determine whether conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) would enhance conversion of ALA to DHA in humans on an ALA-supplemented diet. The subjects (n=8 per group) received daily supplementation of ALA (11g) and either CLA (3.2g) or placebo for 8 weeks. At baseline, 4 and 8 weeks, blood was collected for plasma fatty acid analysis and a number of physiological measures were examined. The ALA-supplemented diet increased plasma levels of ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The addition of CLA to the ALA diet resulted in increased plasma levels of CLA, as well as ALA and EPA. Plasma level of DHA was not increased with either the ALA alone or ALA plus CLA supplementation. The results demonstrated that CLA was not effective in enhancing DHA levels in plasma in healthy volunteers.",M3
17284733,"Dietary alpha-linolenic acid inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in hypercholesterolemic subjects.BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. We previously reported that a diet high in alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) reduces lipid and inflammatory cardiovascular disease risk factors in hypercholesterolemic subjects. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effects of a diet high in ALA on serum proinflammatory cytokine concentrations and cytokine production by cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects fed the experimental diets. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, 3-diet, 3-period crossover study design was used. Hypercholesterolemic subjects (n = 23) were assigned to 3 experimental diets: a diet high in ALA (ALA diet; 6.5% of energy), a diet high in linoleic acid (LA diet; 12.6% of energy), and an average American diet (AAD) for 6 wk. Serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations and the production of IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha by PBMCs were measured. RESULTS: IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha production by PBMCs and serum TNF-alpha concentrations were lower (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.08, respectively) with the ALA diet than with the LA diet or AAD. PBMC production of TNF-alpha was inversely correlated with ALA (r = -0.402, P = 0.07) and with eicosapentaenoic acid (r = -0.476, P = 0.03) concentrations in PBMC lipids with the ALA diet. Changes in serum ALA were inversely correlated with changes in TNF-alpha produced by PBMCs (r = -0.423, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increased intakes of dietary ALA elicit antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha production in cultured PBMCs. Changes in PBMC ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (derived from dietary ALA) are associated with beneficial changes in TNF-alpha release. Thus, the cardioprotective effects of ALA are mediated in part by a reduction in the production of inflammatory cytokines.",M3
17254747,"Dietary omega-3 fatty acids for women.This review details the specific needs of women for omega-3 fatty acids, including alpha linoleic acid (<e>ALA</e>) and the very long chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-3 fatty acid (dietary or in capsules) ensures that a woman's adipose tissue contains a reserve of these fatty acids for the developing fetus and the breast-fed newborn infant. This ensures the optimal cerebral and cognitive development of the infant. The presence of large quantities of EPA and DHA in the diet slightly lengthens pregnancy, and improves its quality. Human milk contains both ALA and DHA, unlike that of other mammals. Conditions such as diabetes can alter the fatty acid profile of mother's milk, while certain diets, like those of vegetarians, vegans, or even macrobiotic diets, can have the same effect, if they do not include seafood. ALA, DHA and EPA, are important for preventing ischemic cardiovascular disease in women of all ages. Omega-3 fatty acids can help to prevent the development of certain cancers, particularly those of the breast and colon, and possibly of the uterus and the skin, and are likely to reduce the risk of postpartum depression, manic-depressive psychosis, dementias (Alzheimer's disease and others), hypertension, toxemia, diabetes and, to a certain extend, age-related macular degeneration. Omega-3 fatty acids could play a positive role in the prevention of menstrual syndrome and postmenopausal hot flushes. The normal western diet contains little ALA (less than 50% of the RDA). The only adequate sources are rapeseed oil (canola), walnuts and so-called  omega-3  eggs (similar to wild-type or Cretan eggs). The amounts of EPA and DHA in the diet vary greatly from person to person. The only good sources are fish and seafood, together with  omega-3  eggs.",M3

Available data indicate a possible beneficial effect of ALA on cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the response of various CVD risk factors to increased ALA intake is not well characterized. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of increased ALA intake on blood pressure in man. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We used a prospective, two-group, parallel-arm design to examine the effect of a 12-week dietary supplementation with flaxseed oil, rich in ALA (8 g/day), on blood pressure in middle-aged dyslipidaemic men (n=59). The diet of the control group was supplemented with safflower oil, containing the equivalent n-6 fatty acid (11 g/day linoleic acid (LA); n=28). Arterial blood pressure was measured at the beginning and at the end of the dietary intervention period. RESULTS: Supplementation with ALA resulted in significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels compared with LA (P=0.016 and P=0.011, respectively, from analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a hypotensive effect of ALA, which may constitute another mechanism accounting in part for the apparent cardioprotective effect of this n-3 fatty acid.",M3
17217386,"The influence of dietary linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid on body composition and the activities of key enzymes of hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in mice.We have recently suggested that feeding the C18 polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), instead of linoleic acid (LA) reduced body fat in mice. However, the difference in body fat did not reach statistical significance, which prompted us to carry out this study using more animals and diets with higher contents of ALA and LA so that the contrast would be greater. The diets contained either 12% (w/w) LA and 3% ALA or 12% ALA and 4% LA. A low-fat diet was used as control. The diets were fed for 35 days. The proportion of body fat was not influenced by the type of dietary fatty acid. Plasma total cholesterol and phospholipids were significantly lower in ALA-fed mice than in mice fed LA. Activities of enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation pathway were significantly raised by these two diets when compared with the control diet. alpha-Linolenic acid vs. LA did not affect fatty acid oxidation enzymes. In mice fed the diet with LA activities of enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis were significantly decreased when compared with mice fed the control diet. alpha-Linolenic acid vs. LA feeding did not influence lipogenic enzymes. It is concluded that feeding mice for 35 days with diets either rich in LA or ALA did not significantly influence body composition.",M3

This is the first controlled feeding study in humans to evaluate the effect of dietary plant-derived n-3 PUFA on bone turnover, assessed by serum concentrations of N-telopeptides (NTx) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP). Subjects (n = 23) consumed each diet for 6 weeks in a randomized, 3-period crossover design: 1) Average American Diet (AAD; [34% total fat, 13% saturated fatty acids (SFA), 13% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), 9% PUFA (7.7% LA, 0.8% <e>ALA</e>)]), 2) Linoleic Acid Diet (LA; [37% total fat, 9% SFA, 12% MUFA, 16% PUFA (12.6% LA, 3.6% ALA)]), and 3) alpha-Linolenic Acid Diet (ALA; [38% total fat, 8% SFA, 12% MUFA, 17% PUFA (10.5% LA, 6.5% ALA)]). Walnuts and flaxseed oil were the predominant sources of ALA. NTx levels were significantly lower following the ALA diet (13.20 +/- 1.21 nM BCE), relative to the AAD (15.59 +/- 1.21 nM BCE) (p &lt; 0.05). Mean NTx level following the LA diet was 13.80 +/- 1.21 nM BCE. There was no change in levels of BSAP across the three diets. Concentrations of NTx were positively correlated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha for all three diets. The results indicate that plant sources of dietary n-3 PUFA may have a protective effect on bone metabolism via a decrease in bone resorption in the presence of consistent levels of bone formation.",M3
17148657,"Alpha-linolenic acid-enriched diet prevents myocardial damage and expands longevity in cardiomyopathic hamsters.Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the increased intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly reduces the risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease, but no investigations have been performed in hereditary cardiomyopathies with diffusely damaged myocardium. In the present study, delta-sarcoglycan-null cardiomyopathic hamsters were fed from weaning to death with an alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>)-enriched versus standard diet. Results demonstrated a great accumulation of ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid and an increased eicosapentaenoic/arachidonic acid ratio in cardiomyopathic hamster hearts, correlating with the preservation of myocardial structure and function. In fact, ALA administration preserved plasmalemma and mitochondrial membrane integrity, thus maintaining proper cell/extracellular matrix contacts and signaling, as well as a normal gene expression profile (myosin heavy chain isoforms, atrial natriuretic peptide, transforming growth factor-beta1) and a limited extension of fibrotic areas within ALA-fed cardiomyopathic hearts. Consequently, hemodynamic indexes were safeguarded, and more than 60% of ALA-fed animals were still alive (mean survival time, 293+/-141.8 days) when all those fed with standard diet were deceased (mean survival time, 175.9+/-56 days). Therefore, the clinically evident beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are mainly related to preservation of myocardium structure and function and the attenuation of myocardial fibrosis.",M3
17180881,"Markedly raised intake of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in rats on a high-fat ketogenic diet does not inhibit carbon recycling of 13C-alpha-linolenate.Under various dietary and physiological conditions, carbon from alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is extensively recycled into saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. In this study we investigated whether carbon is still recycled from ALA when a dietary source of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids is provided in excess. 13C-labeled ALA was given to rats consuming a high-fat ketogenic diet and to rats consuming a low-fat control diet. In rats on the ketogenic diet, 13C recycling from alpha-linolenate into several, but not all, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids matched or exceeded that in the controls (P &lt; 0.05).

17134970,"HER2 (erbB-2)-targeted effects of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>; 18:3n-3), in breast cancer cells: the  fat features  of the  Mediterranean diet  as an  anti-HER2 cocktail .BACKGROUND: Data derived from epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that alphalinolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), the main omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) present in the Western diet, may have protective effects in breast cancer risk and metastatic progression. A recent pilot clinical trial assessing the effects of ALA-rich dietary flaxseed on tumor biological markers in postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer demonstrated significant reductions in tumor growth and in HER2 (erbB-2) oncogene expression. HYPOTHESIS: The molecular mechanism by which ALA inhibits breast cancer cell growth and metastasis formation may involve a direct regulation of HER2, a well-characterized oncogene playing a key role in the etiology, progression and response to some chemo- and endocrine therapies in approximately 20% of breast carcinomas. METHODS: Using HER2-specific ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, RT-PCR and HER2 promoter-reporter analyses, we characterized the effects of exogenous supplementation with ALA on the expression of HER2 oncogene, a master key player in the onset and metastasis formation of breast cancer disease. Metabolic status (MTT) assays were performed to evaluate the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and the humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). To study these issues we used BT-474 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, which naturally exhibit amplification of the HER2 oncogene. RESULTS: ALA treatment dramatically suppressed the expression of HER2-coded p185Her-2/neu oncoprotein as determined by ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting techniques. Interestingly, ALA-induced down-regulation of p185Her-2/neu correlated with a transcriptional response as no HER2 mRNA signal could be detected by RT-PCR upon treatment with optimal concentrations of ALA (up to 20 microM). Consistent with these findings, ALA exposure was found to dramatically repress the activity of a Luciferase reporter gene driven by the HER2 promoter. Moreover, the nature of the cytotoxic interaction between ALA and trastuzumab (Herceptin) revealed a significant synergism as assessed by MTT-based cell viability assays. CONCLUSIONS: i) These findings reveal that the omega-3 PUFA ALA suppresses overexpression of HER2 oncogene at the transcriptional level, which, in turn, interacts synergistically with anti-HER2 trastuzumab- based immunotherapy. ii) Our results molecularly support a recent randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial suggesting that ALA may be a potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used drugs in the management of HER2-positive breast carcinomas. iii) Considering our previous findings demonstrating the &lt;&lt;HER2 upregulatory actions&gt;&gt; of the omega-6 PUFA linolenic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and the &lt;&lt;HER2 down-regulatory actions &gt;&gt; of the omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and of the omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (OA; 18:1n-9), it is reasonable to suggest that a low omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio and elevated MUFA levels, the two prominent &lt;&lt;fat features&gt;&gt; of the &lt;&lt;Mediterranean diet&gt;&gt;, should be extremely efficient at blocking HER2 expression in breast cancer cells.",M3
17122327,"Effect of dietary hempseed intake on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have significant, cardioprotective effects against ischemia. Hempseed contains a high proportion of the PUFAs linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), which may have opposing effects on postischemic heart performance. There are no reported data concerning the cardiovascular effects of dietary hempseed intake. A group of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed evenly into four groups that were fed for 12 wk a normal rat chow supplemented with hempseed (5% and 10%), palm oil (1%), or a 10% partially delipidated hempseed that served as a control. Plasma ALA and gamma-linolenic acid levels were significantly elevated in the rats that were fed a 5% or 10% hempseed-supplemented diet, but in heart tissue only ALA levels were significantly elevated in the rats fed these diets compared with control. After the dietary interventions were completed, postischemic heart performance was evaluated by measuring developed tension, resting tension, the rates of tension development and relaxation, and the number of extrasystoles. Hearts from rats fed a hempseed-supplemented diet exhibited significantly better postischemic recovery of maximal contractile function and enhanced rates of tension development and relaxation during reperfusion than hearts from the other groups. These hearts, however, were not protected from the occurrence of extrasystoles, nor were the increases in resting tension altered during ischemia or reperfusion as a function of any dietary intervention. Our data demonstrate that dietary hempseed can provide significant cardioprotective effects during postischemic reperfusion. This appears to be due to its highly enriched PUFA content.",M3

RESULTS: Several observational studies in healthy individuals and in patients with coronary heart disease have indicated that a diet rich in ALA reduces coronary death and the risk for sudden death. A cross-sectional study has shown a beneficial effect of ALA on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Three secondary studies have also indicated beneficial effects of ALA on several cardiovascular end-points. Diet studies do have limitations, and the secondary prophylactic studies have not given a definite answer to whether ALA possesses beneficial cardiovascular effects. INTERPRETATION: On the whole, the observational and secondary prophylactic studies indicate that ALA may have cardioprotective effects in healthy individuals and in patients with coronary heart disease. For those who seldom eat fish and only take small amounts of fish oils, a diet rich on ALA may be an alternative.",M3
17059813,"Differential sensitivities of the NCX1.1 and NCX1.3 isoforms of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to alpha-linolenic acid.OBJECTIVE: Dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) like alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective. PUFA may also be beneficial in hypertension. Altered Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) activity has been implicated in arrhythmias, hypertension and heart failure and may be a target for PUFA. Thus, we tested the effects of ALA and other distinct fatty acids on the cardiac (NCX1.1) and vascular (NCX1.3) NCX isoforms. METHODS: HEK293 cells stably expressing NCX isoforms were ramped from +60 to -100 mV (over 1600 ms) in the absence and presence of 25 microM oleic acid (OA, omega-9), linoleic acid (LA, omega-6), ALA (omega-3), or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, omega-3). NiCl(2) (5 mM) was used to inhibit and therefore identify the NCX current. The effect of 25 microM ALA on NCX1.1 and NCX1.3 activity was also assessed in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) by measuring [Ca(2+)](i) following substitution of [Na(+)](o) with Li(+). RESULTS: Application of Ni(2+) had no effect in non-transfected cells. ALA and EPA (25 microM) reduced the Ni(2+)-sensitive forward NCX1.1 current (at -100 mV) by 64% and reverse current (at +60 mV) by 57%, and inhibited the Ni(2+)-sensitive NCX1.3 forward and reverse currents by 79% and 76%, respectively. Neither OA nor LA (25 microM) affected the NCX1.1 currents, but both partially inhibited the forward and reverse mode NCX1.3 currents. Inhibition of NCX1.3 by ALA occurred at a much lower IC(50) ( approximately 19 nM) than for NCX1.1 ( approximately 120 nM). In cardiomyocytes and VSMC, ALA significantly reduced the Li(+)-induced rise in intracellular [Ca(2+)]. CONCLUSIONS: NCX1.3 is more sensitive to inhibition by ALA than NCX1.1. In addition, only omega-3 PUFA inhibits NCX1.1, but several classes of fatty acids inhibit NCX1.3. The differential sensitivity of NCX isoforms to fatty acids may have important implications as therapeutic approaches for hypertension, heart failure and arrhythmias.",M3
17058434,"The Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.Epidemiological studies as well as randomised dietary trials suggest that Mediterranean diet may be important in relation to the pathogenesis and prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). A striking protective effect of a Mediterranean diet rich in alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) was reported in the Lyon Diet Heart Study with a 50 to 70% reduction of the risk of recurrence after four years of follow-up in CHD patients. According to current knowledge, dietary ALA should represent about 0.6 to 1% of total daily energy or about 2 g per day in patients who follow a traditional Mediterranean diet. Supplementation with very long chain omega-3 fatty acids (c.1g per day) in patients following a Mediterranean type of diet was shown to decrease the risk of cardiac death by 30% and of sudden cardiac death by 45% in the GISSI trial. Thus, in the context of a diet rich in oleic acid, poor in saturated fats and not high in omega-6 fatty acids (a dietary pattern characterizing the traditional Mediterranean diet), even a small dose of very long chain omega-3 fatty acids (one gram under the form of capsules) might be very protective. These data underline the importance of the accompanying diet in any dietary strategy using fatty acid complements.",M3
17056811,"Flaxseed oil supplementation does not affect plasma lipoprotein concentration or particle size in human subjects.alpha-Linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) is a major dietary (n-3) fatty acid. Some clinical trials with ALA supplementation have shown reduced cardiovascular risk; however the specific cardioprotective mechanism is not known. We studied the effects of daily supplementation with ALA derived from flaxseed oil on concentrations of plasma LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipid particle sizes. In a randomized double-blind trial, 56 participants were given 3 g/d of ALA from flaxseed oil in capsules (n = 31) or olive oil containing placebo capsules (n = 25) for 26 wk. Changes in plasma HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations did not differ between the 2 groups at 26 wk. The adjusted plasma total cholesterol concentration at 26 wk was 0.45 mmol/L higher in the flaxseed oil group (5.43 +/- 0.03 mmol/L) compared with the olive oil group (5.17 +/- 0.07 mmol/L) (P = 0.026). ALA did not affect LDL, HDL, or IDL particle size; however, the concentrations of the large, less atherogenic LDL1 (P = 0.058) and LDL2 (P = 0.083) subfractions tended to be greater in the ALA group. In conclusion, ALA does not decrease CVD risk by altering lipoprotein particle size or plasma lipoprotein concentrations.",M3
17016414,"Alpha-linolenic acid and cardiovascular diseases omega-3 fatty acids beyond eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.Over the last decades, an increasing body of evidence has been accumulated on the beneficial effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids both in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, the vast majority of the studies has been performed on long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and not on their biochemical precursor, alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>). Actually, ALA has some other beneficial effects apart from the known antiarrhythmic effect. In fact, ALA has a strong inhibitory effect on omega-6 metabolic pathway. An adequate daily intake of ALA shifts metabolic pathway to EPA, so favoring the formation of products with a predominant antiaggregating and vasorelaxing action, with respect to eicosanoids with a predominant thrombotic effect. Some important evidences have been raised on the association between ALA and cardiovascular mortality. Indeed, dietary ALA has been associated with a lower rate of fatal and nonfatal coronary events. Hence, major scientific associations published nutritional guidelines including a specific recommendation for ALA.",M3
17008073,"Levels of the n-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid in addition to those of alpha linolenic acid are significantly raised in blood lipids by the intake of four walnuts a day in humans.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ingestion of alpha linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>), with the richest source among dry fruits such as walnuts, is associated with cardiovascular prevention. The aim of this study was to selectively evaluate the effects of moderate walnut consumption on the levels of ALA and its metabolic derivatives in human blood. METHODS AND RESULTS: After a 2-week run-in period, 10 volunteers consumed 4 walnuts per day (in addition to their habitual diet) for 3 weeks. Fatty acid profiles, with special attention to levels of ALA and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), were assessed in blood drops collected from fingertips. The data indicate that the administration of a few walnuts a day for 3 weeks significantly increases blood levels, not only of ALA (from 0.23+/-0.07 SD to 0.47+/-0.13 SD), but also of its longer chain derivative eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) (from 0.23+/-0.37 to 0.82+/-0.41) with levels remaining elevated over basal values after washout. CONCLUSION: The findings of this pilot study indicate that plant ALA in appropriate food items favourably affects the n-3 LC-PUFA status.",M3
16983146,"Higher plasma docosahexaenoic acid is associated with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in women with CAD.Fish intake, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and in some cases alpha-linolenic acid (<e>ALA</e>) have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events and death. The association between n-3 fatty acids in plasma lipids and the progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis was assessed among women with established coronary artery disease (CAD). A prospective cohort study involved postmenopausal women (n = 228) participating in the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis Trial. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and after 3.2 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) years. Women with plasma phospholipid (PL) DHA levels above the median, compared with below, exhibited less atherosclerosis progression, as expressed by decline in minimum coronary artery diameter (-0.04 +/- 0.02 and -0.10 +/- 0.02 mm, respectively; P = 0.007) or increase in percentage stenosis (1.34 +/- 0.76% and 3.75 +/- 0.74%, respectively; P = 0.006), and had fewer new lesions [2.0% (0.5-3.5%) of measured segments (95% confidence interval) and 4.2% (2.8-5.6%), respectively; P = 0.009] after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors. Similar results were observed for DHA in the triglycerides (TGs). EPA and ALA in plasma lipids were not significantly associated with atherosclerosis progression. Consistent with higher reported fish intake, higher levels of plasma TG and PL DHA are associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women with CAD.",M3
