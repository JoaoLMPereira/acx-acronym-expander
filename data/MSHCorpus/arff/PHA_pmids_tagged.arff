20363988,"Oxytocin both increases proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphomonocytes to phytohemagglutinin and reverses immunosuppressive estrogen activity.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that the neurohypophyseal peptide oxytocin is present in the human thymus and in vitro it can mimic interleukin (IL)-2 action in the induction of interferon-gamma production. In the present study, we tested the capacity of oxytocin to modulate the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and its ability to change the membrane expression of IL-2 receptor CD25 and the CD95 activation marker. Furthermore, whether oxytocin was able to reverse the inhibition of PBMC blastic response and CD25 expression induced by estradiol benzoate (E(2)B) was studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen healthy women were studied with a mean age of 33.8 years, no previous pregnancies, all in the early follicular phase of the cycle with normal values of circulating estrogens. RESULTS: The addition of oxytocin (1x10(-10) M, 1x10(-11) M, 1x10(-12) M) significantly increased the PBMC blastic response to PHA as well as the expression of both CD25 and CD95. These results were due to interaction of oxytocin with its specific receptor since the addition of an oxytocin antagonist completely reversed the oxytocin activity. In contrast, E(2)B induced a marked decrease of PHA-stimulated PBMC cell cycle progression and CD25 expression: the inhibitory effect of E(2)B was significantly counteracted by low concentrations of oxytocin. CONCLUSION: The present results support the hypothesis that neuropeptides may act as a link in the network between the immune and the neuroendocrine systems.",M1
20349749,"Blood transport method for chromosome analysis of residents living near Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.A study was conducted to compare the storage conditions and transportation period for blood samples collected from residents living in areas near the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site (SNTS). Experiments were performed to simulate storage and shipping environments. Phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-stimulated blood was stored in 15-ml tubes (condition A: current transport method) in the absence or in 50-ml flasks (condition B: previous transport method) in the presence of RPMI-1640 and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Samples were kept refrigerated at 4 degrees C and cell viability was assessed after 3, 8, 12 and 14 days of storage. RPMI-1640, 20% FBS and further PHA were added to blood samples under condition A in 50-ml flasks for culture. Whole-blood samples under condition B were directly incubated without further sub-culturing process, neither media nor PHA were added, to adopt a similar protocol to that employed in the previous transport method. Samples in condition A and condition B were incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C and their mitotic index was determined. The results showed that viable lymphocytes were consistent in both storage conditions but the mitotic index was higher in condition A than in condition B. Although further confirmation studies have to be carried out, previous chromosomal studies and the present experiment have shown that PHA-stimulated blood could be stored without culture medium for up to 8 days under condition A. The present results will be useful for cytogenetic analysis of blood samples that have been transported long distances wherever a radiation accident has occurred.",M1
20210081,"Immunostimulatory acivity of Calophyllum brasiliense, Ipomoea pes-caprae and Matayba elaeagnoides demonstrated by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation.This study evaluates the effect of methanol extracts of three Brazilian medicinal plants on in vitro proliferation of human mononuclear cells. Lymphoproliferation assay was carried out by incubating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors (1 x 10(6) cells/mL) with extracts of Calophyllum brasiliense (roots), Ipomoea pes-caprae (whole plant) and Matayba elaeagnoides (bark), both at 10, 50, 100 and 200 microg/mL, alone or with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>, 5 microg/mL), in 96-well microplates at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2, for 72 h. The quantification of cell proliferation assay was performed by blue tetrazolium (MTT) reduction with reading at 540 nm. Cells incubated with only the culture medium were used as negative control for cell proliferation, while the positive control consisted of cells and PHA. The results suggest that the extracts of all three studied plants induce T lymphocyte proliferation. I. pes-caprae showed immunostimulatory activity three times higher than the C. brasiliense extract, while that of the M. elaeagnoides extract was 1.5 times higher. The results demonstrate immunostimulatory effects of these three plants, therefore the continuity of these studies is recommended, in order to determine the active principles.",M1
20163586,"Mobiloization of intracellular calcium ions in chicken and rat lymphocytes induced by T cell mitogens.Cytosolic Ca(2+) is known to be an important factor in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate several cellular functions. The present study was designed to measure the intracellular concentrations of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) in T cell mitogen-stimulated chicken lymphocytes, and to compare the results with those in rat lymphocytes. [Ca(2+)](i) was increased in the thymocytes, splenocytes and bursacytes of chickens, and in the thymocytes and splenocytes of rats following exposure to the mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and concanavalin A (ConA). Increases were greatest in the thymocytes followed by the splenocytes and bursacytes. The PHA-induced changes in the thymocytes and splenocytes were similar in chickens and rats, but the ConA-induced increases were significantly lower in the chickens than rats. Pretreatment with EGTA before the application of PHA and ConA completely suppressed the rise in [Ca(2+)](i) in all the chicken lymphocytes, indicating that the increases that occurred in PHA- and ConA-treated chicken lymphocytes could be entirely attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca(2+). On the other hand, the PHA- and ConA-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in rat lymphocytes was not completely suppressed by EGTA, indicating the recruitment of Ca(2+) from the intracellular Ca(2+) pool. The results suggest species differences in the Ca(2+)-based responses to T cell mitogens between chicken lymphocytes and rat lymphocytes.",M1
20103721,"zeta-Crystallin is a bcl-2 mRNA binding protein involved in bcl-2 overexpression in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.The human antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene has been discovered in t(14;18) B-cell leukemias/lymphomas because of its overexpression caused at a transcriptional control level by the bcl-2/IgH fusion gene. We were the first to disclose the post-transcriptional control of bcl-2 expression mediated by interactions of an adenine + uracil (AU)-rich element (ARE) in the 3'-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA with AU-binding proteins (AUBPs). Here, we identify and characterize zeta-crystallin as a new bcl-2 AUBP, whose silencing or overexpression has impact on bcl-2 mRNA stability. An increased Bcl-2 level observed in normal phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-activated T lymphocytes, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) T-cell lines, and T cells of patients with leukemia in comparison with normal non-PHA-activated T lymphocytes was concomitant with an increase in zeta-crystallin level. The specific association of zeta-crystallin with the bcl-2 ARE was significantly enhanced in T cells of patients with ALL, which accounts for the higher stability of bcl-2 mRNA and suggests a possible contribution of zeta-crystallin to bcl-2 overexpression occurring in this leukemia.",M1
20003431,"Aqueous extracts from dietary supplements influence the production of inflammatory cytokines in immortalized and primary T lymphocytes.BACKGROUND: Congaplex and Immuplex are dietary supplements that have been traditionally used to support immune system function. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether Congaplex and Immuplex affect immune function using primary and immortalized T lymphocytes. METHODS: Immortalized CEM and Jurkat T lymphocytes and primary peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) were treated with the aqueous extracts from Congaplex and Immuplex to determine the effects of these products on cytokine production in activated T lymphocytes. RESULTS: Congaplex enhanced phytohemagglutinin/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (<e>PHA</e>/PMA) stimulation of both CEM and Jurkat cells as measured by the production of cytokines, while Immuplex suppressed PHA/PMA-induced production of cytokines, with the exception of interleukin (IL)-8 which was enhanced by Immuplex. In vitro treatment of PBMCs from 10 healthy donors with Congaplex or Immuplex decreased PHA-stimulated production of interferon (IFN)-gamma but increased the production of IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: While the effects of Congaplex and Immuplex differed in these two models, these data demonstrate that the aqueous extracts from these two dietary supplements can affect the inflammatory response of T lymphocytes.",M1
19967526,"In vivo functional tests for assessing immunotoxicity in birds.Various methods have been adapted for assessing the effects of environmental contaminants on the structure and function of the immune system in wild and captive birds. This chapter describes two integrative functional assays that have been adapted to a variety of avian species and have proven to be sensitive biomarkers for immunotoxicological effects. The phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) skin test measures T cell-mediated immunity. PHA is injected intra- or sub-dermally into the wing web of the elbow joint (or interdigitary skin or wattle). The PHA stimulates T lymphocytes to release cytokines that cause an inflammatory influx of leukocytes and fluid. The thickness of the wing web is measured before and 24 h after injection. A stimulation index, which reflects T cell function, is calculated as the increase in skin thickness caused by the PHA minus the increase caused by an injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the other wing web. In addition to its sensitivity to contaminants, ecological studies have shown that the PHA skin response is positively associated with rates of survival and colonization of new areas (i.e., ability to found new local populations) in wild birds.The sheep red blood cell (SRBC) hemagglutination assay measures the antibody response to immunization with SRBC antigens, integrating the functions of B lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, and macrophages. A SRBC suspension is injected i.v., and a blood sample is collected approximately 6 days later. Plasma (or serum) from the blood sample is serially diluted in a microtiter plate, and SRBCs are added. The magnitude of the antibody response is defined as the titer - the highest dilution of plasma in which the concentration of antibody is sufficient to agglutinate the SRBCs. Both IgM and IgG titers can be measured. This avian test is very similar in principle to the anti-SRBC ELISA and splenic plaque forming assays used for immunotoxicological testing in rodents. However, this avian hemagglutination assay does not require a species-specific secondary antibody (as does the ELISA), and this minimally invasive, nonlethal procedure is amenable to studies of protected species, as opposed to the splenic assay. The PHA and SRBC assays have been employed successfully in both the laboratory and field. In ecological studies birds must be recaptured 24 h or 6 days after the initial injections, limiting their use in some species. However, their sensitivity to a variety of contaminants and their ease of adaptability to a variety of species have made the PHA and SRBC tests some of the most commonly used assays for screening and monitoring immunotoxicity in birds.",M1
19965584,"Reduced prostaglandin F2 alpha release from blood mononuclear leukocytes after oral supplementation of omega3 fatty acids: the OmegAD study.Omega-3 fatty acids, e.g., dokosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eikosapentaenoic acid (EPA), ameliorate inflammatory reactions by various mechanisms, but the role of prostaglandins remains unclear. Our aim was to determine if dietary supplementation with a DHA-rich fish oil influenced the release of PGF(2alpha) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In the OmegAD study, 174 Alzheimer disease patients received either 1.7 g DHA plus 0.6 g EPA or a placebo daily for six months. PBMCs from the 21 (9 on fish oil and 12 on placebo) first-randomized patients were stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) before and after 6 months. Our results showed that plasma concentrations of DHA and EPA increased significantly at 6 months in the omega-3 group. PGF(2alpha) release from LPS- (but not from PHA-) stimulated PBMC was significantly diminished in this group; no change was noted in the placebo group. PGF(2alpha) changes correlated inversely with changes in plasma DHA and EPA. Decreased IL-6 and IL-1(beta) levels correlated with decreased PGF(2alpha) levels. The stimulus-specific PGF(2alpha) release from PBMC after 6 months of oral supplementation with the DHA-rich fish oil might be one event related to reduced inflammatory reactions associated with omega-3 fatty acid intake.",M1
19922801,"Establishment of an IFN-gamma specific reporter cell line in fish.An interferon (IFN)-gamma responsive stable cell line RTG-3F7 has been developed for rainbow trout by modifying the RTG-2 cell line through transfection with a plasmid construct (pGL4.14[luc2/hygro]-PrTAP2) containing a promoter element from the IFN-gamma responsive gene TAP2 linked to a luciferase reporter gene and a hygromycin resistance gene. Following transfection single clones were selected in 96 well plates using hygromycin B, and those showing specific activation after rIFN-gamma stimulation were maintained. Five clones that showed the highest reporter activity to rIFN-gamma were incubated with different stimuli to examine specificity. No significant induction of luciferase was observed following exposure to recombinant type I IFN, LPS, <e>PHA</e> or poly I:C. The cell line was responsive to rIFN-gamma at concentrations between 150 pg and 20 ng ml(-1). Supernatants of primary cultures of head kidney leucocytes stimulated with PHA, known to induce IFN-gamma gene expression, were also used to assess the reporter activity of the stable cell line. A dose-dependent induction of the promoter activity was observed with these supernatants indicating the presence of IFN-gamma. These results indicate that the stable cell line RTG-3F7 is an excellent tool for monitoring the presence of trout IFN-gamma in biological samples, and in addition, enables the study of intracellular signalling pathways of IFNs, their receptor interactions, and other closely related signalling networks.",M1
19922798,"Characterization of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) Foxp1a/1b/2: evidence for their involvement in the activation of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations.Foxp subfamily belongs to the Fox family of winged-helix transcription factors and plays critical roles in multiple biological processes including development and immunoregulation. However, little is known about the regulation and function of Foxp subfamily in fish immune system. In this study, we obtained the complete cDNAs of grass carp Foxp1a, Foxp1b and Foxp2. They possess the conserved leucine zipper domain, zinc finger domain and forkhead domain when compared with their mammalian counterparts, except that Foxp1a lacks the forkhead domain. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that their transcripts were mainly found in thymus, spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). In grass carp PBLs, both LPS and <e>PHA</e> were effective in elevating Foxp1b mRNA levels but had no effect on Foxp1a mRNA, while only PHA affected Foxp2 mRNA expression. Using the same cell model, PHA was revealed to up-regulate mRNA expression of T-cell marker genes (CD4-like, CD8alpha and CD8beta) but not B-cell marker gene (IgM). Unlike PHA, LPS increased IgM mRNA level but did not affect T-cell marker gene expression. These findings suggest that PHA and LPS may act on distinct lymphocyte subpopulations in grass carp PBLs and provide evidence for the involvement of Foxp1b and Foxp2 in the activation of different lymphocyte subpopulations in grass carp.",M1
19854262,"Alteration of serotonin transporter messenger RNA level in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from simian/human immunodeficiency virus infected Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta).Serotonin transporter (SERT, 5-HTT) is a key element in the serotonergic system which is probably involved in the psychiatric disorders commonly observed in people living with HIV/AIDS. However, no information is available about the effects of HIV infection on SERT expression. In this study, a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR method was established, levels of SERT mRNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and various tissues from normal Chinese rhesus macaques, in PBMCs from 32 SHIV-sf162p4 infected rhesus macaques and from 8 rhesus macaques before and 7, 14, 21, 28 and 196 days after SHIV-sf162p4 infection, and in PBMCs before and after in vitro phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) stimulation were examined. It was found that SERT mRNA was widely distributed in lymphoid tissues; the level of SERT mRNA was significantly reduced in PBMCs from SHIV infected rhesus macaques and in PBMCs stimulated with PHA. The most evident decrease (to about one-tenth) in SERT mRNA level was observed at day 7 after SHIV infection. Difference in PBMC SERT mRNA level between 5-HTTLPR genotypes was not statistically significant. These data indicated that, in addition to previously observed abnormality in serotonin metabolism, SERT expression might be affected in HIV/AIDS, which might be associated with depression and other psychiatric disorders in HIV/AIDS. Besides, this study provided a basis for quantitative analysis of SERT gene expression under effects of host and environmental factors, such as 5-HTTLPR genotypes, SERT targeting drugs or other infectious agents.",M1
19810098,"Titanium uptake, induction of RANK-L expression, and enhanced proliferation of human T-lymphocytes.There is increasing evidence that titanium ions are released from orthopedic implants by biocorrosion. The aim of this study was to investigate titanium uptake by human T-lymphocytes and its effects on phenotype and proliferation. Freshly isolated human nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NA-PBMC), were exposed to TiCl4 [Ti(IV)]. Bioavailability and distribution of Ti(IV) in T-lymphocytes was determined by energy-filtered electron microscopy (EFTEM). The effects of Ti(IV) challenge on nonactivated and <e>PHA</e>-activated cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers, RANK-L production, and proliferation assays. EFTEM colocalized Ti(IV) with phosphorus in the nucleus, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membranes, and the surface membrane of T-lymphocytes. Ti(IV) increased significantly the expression of CD69, CCR4, and RANK-L in a concentration-dependent manner. Titanium enters T-lymphocytes through a currently unknown mechanism and binds to phosphorus-rich cell structures. Titanium influences phenotype and function of T-lymphocytes, resulting in activation of a CD69+ and CCR4+ T-lymphocyte population and secretion of RANK-L. These results strongly suggest the involvement of titanium ions challenged T-lymphocytes in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants.",M1
19796085,"Synergistic and antagonistic interaction between different branches of the immune system is related to melanin-based coloration in nestling tawny owls.When exposed to parasites, hosts often mount energetically expensive immune responses, and this may alter resource allocation between competing life history traits including other components of the immune system. Here, we investigated whether a humoral immune challenge towards a vaccine reduces or enhances the cutaneous immune responses towards an injection of lipopolysaccharid (LPS, innate immunity) and phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>, T-cell immunity) in nestling tawny owls in interaction with the degree of plumage melanin-based coloration. The humoral immune challenge enhanced the response to LPS similarly in differently coloured nestlings. In contrast, the same humoral immune challenge enhanced immune response to PHA in dark reddish melanic nestlings while reducing it in pale reddish melanic nestlings. Our results highlight that both antagonistic and synergistic interactions can take place among branches of immune system, and that the sign and magnitude of these interactions can vary with immune responses involved and the degree of melanin-based coloration.",M1
19783695,"Effect of dietary omega-3 fatty acid source on plasma and red blood cell membrane composition and immune function in yearling horses.To determine the effect of different sources of dietary n-3 fatty acids (FA) on plasma and red blood cell (RBC) FA composition and immune response, 18 Quarter Horse yearlings were randomly and equally assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: encapsulated fish oil (n = 6), milled flaxseed (n = 6), or no supplementation (control, n = 6). Fish oil contained 15 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) and 12.5 g of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3), and flaxseed contained 61 g of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) per 100 g of FA. Horses had free access to bahiagrass pasture during the active growing season and were individually fed a grain mix concentrate at 1.5% BW/d. Fish oil and flaxseed were mixed into the concentrate in amounts to provide 6 g of total n-3/100 kg of BW. Horses were fed their respective treatments for 70 d. Blood samples were obtained to determine plasma and RBC FA composition and for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) to determine lymphocyte proliferation and were challenged with lipopolysaccharide to determine PGE(2) production. In vivo inflammatory response was assessed on d 70 by measuring skin thickness and area of swelling in response to intradermal injection of PHA. Treatment did not affect BW gain, which averaged 0.6 +/- 0.03 kg/d. Horses fed fish oil had greater (P &lt; 0.05) proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and sum of n-3 in plasma and RBC compared with those in the flaxseed and control treatments. In addition, plasma arachidonic acid was greater (P &lt; 0.05) and plasma linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids were less (P &lt; 0.05) in the fish oil treatment compared with the flaxseed and control treatments. Dietary treatment did not affect lymphocyte proliferation or PGE(2) production. Across treatments, the peak increase in skin thickness was observed 4 to 8 h after PHA injection. At 4 h postinjection, horses fed fish oil and those fed flaxseed had a greater increase in skin thickness than those in the control treatment (P &lt; 0.05) and horses fed fish oil had a larger area of swelling than those in the control treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Skin thickness remained greater (P &lt; 0.05) in horses fed flaxseed than in control horses 6 h after injection. Although fed to supply a similar amount of n-3 FA, fish oil had a greater impact on plasma and RBC n-3 FA content than did flaxseed. However, supplementing horses with both fish oil and flaxseed resulted in a more pronounced early inflammatory response to PHA injection as compared with nonsupplemented horses.",M1
19726615,"Cryopreservation decreases receptor PD-1 and ligand PD-L1 coinhibitory expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells and monocytes.The B7-CD28 immunoglobulin superfamily of costimulatory and coinhibitory ligands and their cell receptors play a critical role in modulating immune responses. Imbalances in these immune regulatory signals occur in pathological conditions characterized by chronic antigenic stimulation. Clinical studies often rely on the use of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to evaluate cellular immune responses. The impact of cryopreservation on these coinhibitory ligands and their cell receptors is unknown. In our studies, cryopreservation significantly reduced the expression of both PD-1 and PD-L1 on PBMC-derived CD3+/CD8+ T cells and CD45+/CD14+ monocytes obtained from adult control subjects. Blockade of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 using both freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC led to higher levels of phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and Candida-induced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) with no effect on IL-10 production. Coinhibitory signaling blockade of freshly isolated, PHA-stimulated PBMC from normal adult controls and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects led to increased production of IL-4 and IL-5. Candida-stimulated PBMC preferentially induced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production, with reduced production of IL-2 and IL-10. This is in contrast to high levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha production with PHA-stimulated cells. The effects of coinhibitory blockade on PHA and Candida-induced lymphoproliferation were varied, with freshly isolated PBMC from adult control subjects and HIV-infected patients yielding higher levels of lymphoproliferation in response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Immune function studies employing cryopreserved cells may lead to increased T-cell effector cytolytic and regulatory immune responses.",M1
19691438,"Pheomelanin-based coloration and the ability to cope with variation in food supply and parasitism.Although gene by environment interactions may play a key role in the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms, little is known about the ecological factors involved in these interactions. We investigated whether food supply and parasites can mediate covariation between the degree of adult pheomelanin-based coloration, a heritable trait, and offspring body mass in the tawny owl (Strix aluco). We swapped clutches between nests to allocate genotypes randomly among environments. Three weeks after hatching, we challenged the immune system of 80 unrelated nestlings with either a phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) or a lipopolysaccharide, surrogates of alternative parasites, and then fed them ad lib. or food-restricted them during the following 6 days in the laboratory. Whatever the immune challenge, nestlings fed ad lib. converted food more efficiently into body mass when their biological mother was dark pheomelanic. In contrast, food-restricted nestlings challenged with PHA lost less body mass when their biological mother was pale pheomelanic. Nestling tawny owls born from differently melanic mothers thus show differing reaction norms relative to food availability and parasitism. This suggests that dark and pale pheomelanic owls reflect alternative adaptations to food availability and parasites, factors known to vary in space and time.",M1
19671600,"Mhc polymorphisms fail to explain the heritability of phytohaemagglutinin-induced skin swelling in a wild passerine.Genetic estimates of the variability of immune responses are rarely examined in natural populations because of confounding environmental effects. As a result, and because of the difficulty of pinpointing the genetic determinants of immunity, no study has to our knowledge examined the contribution of specific genes to the heritability of an immune response in wild populations. We cross-fostered nestling house sparrows to disrupt the association between genetic and environmental effects and determine the heritability of the response to a classic immunological test, the phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-induced skin swelling. We detected significant heritability estimates of the response to PHA, of body mass and tarsus length when nestlings were 5 and 10 days old. Variation at Mhc genes, however, did not explain a significant portion of the genetic variation of nestling swelling to PHA. Our results suggest that while PHA-induced swelling is influenced by the nest of origin, the importance of additive genetic variation relative to non-additive genetic variation and the genetic factors that influence the former in wild populations still need to be identified for this trait.",M1
19670272,"AFM- and NSOM-based force spectroscopy and distribution analysis of CD69 molecules on human CD4+ T cell membrane.Although CD69 is well known as an early T cell-activation marker, the possibility that CD69 are distributed as nano-structures on membrane for immune regulation during T cell activation has not been tested. In this study, nanoscale features of CD69 expression on activated T cells were determined using the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic and force-binding nanotechnology as well as near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM)-/fluorescence quantum dot (QD)-based nanosacle imaging. Unstimulated CD4(+) T cells showed neglectable numbers of membrane CD69 spots binding to the CD69 Ab-functinalized AFM tip, and no detectable QD-bound CD69 as examined by NSOM/QD-based imaging. In contrast, Phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-activated CD4(+) T cells expressed CD69, and displayed many force-binding spots binding to the CD69 Ab-functionalized AFM tip on about 45% of cell membrane, with mean binding-rupture forces 276 +/- 71 pN. Most CD69 molecules appeared to be expressed as 100-200 nm nanoclusters on the membrane of PHA-activated CD4(+) T cells. Meanwhile, NSOM/QD-based nanoscale imaging showed that CD69 were non-uniformly distributed as 80-200 nm nanoclusters on cell-membrane of PHA-activated CD4(+) T cells. This study represents the first demonstration of the nano-biology of CD69 expression during T cell activation.",M1
19645485,"Quantitative analysis of an aberrant glycoform of TIMP1 from colon cancer serum by L-<e>PHA</e>-enrichment and SISCAPA with MRM mass spectrometry.Variations in glycosylation levels or in the glycoprofile of a certain glycoprotein in tumor-related sera have been widely reported and can be used as a means of differentiation. However, quantitative mass analysis of glycoproteins is difficult because of their high structural complexity and low mass sensitivity of glycopeptides. Therefore, more powerful technologies are required for the discovery of these potential biomarkers. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a glycoprotein typically present at a low concentration in serum, is known to be aberrantly glycosylated in colorectal cancer cell lines as a result of the terminal addition of beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine (beta-1,6-GlcNAc) by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V (GnT-V), which is reportedly up-regulated in invasive/metastatic cancer cells. In this report, a highly sensitive method is presented for the quantitative analysis of aberrant GlcNAcylated TIMP1 in the serum of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Glycoproteins having an N-linked glycan terminating with beta-1,6-GlcNAc were enriched by phytohemagglutinin-L(4) (L-PHA), a lectin that specifically recognizes the beta-1,6-GlcNAc moiety of N-linked glycan. The L-PHA-enriched glycoproteins were digested in solution with trypsin. With the use of a monoclonal anti-peptide TIMP1 antibody linked covalently to magnetic beads, a unique target peptide (antigen) of TIMP1 was immuno-enriched from the L-PHA-enriched tryptic digests and analyzed quantitatively by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass analysis. The systematic coupling of L-PHA lectin enrichment followed by stable isotope standards and capture by anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA) with MRM mass analysis afforded quantitation of TIMP1 at attomolar (10(-18)) concentrations. An aberrantly GlcNAcylated substoichiometric TIMP1 isoform was quantified at approximately 0.8 ng/mL serum, using sample equivalent to only 1.7 microL of serum from a CRC patient. This approach provides a useful tool for the quantitation of a specific aberrant glycoform from human serum containing a variety of protein isoforms and may be helpful in studies of biological function as it pertains to protein glycan heterogeneity.",M1
19637754,"[The expression of CD25 in phytohemagglutinin- or interleukin-2-stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes]The timely expression of a high affinity receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2R) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by various mitogens was examined by cytophotometric evaluation of the number of CD25 bearing cells (CD25+). In resting lymphocyte culture both phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>, 10 (microg/ml) and 12,13-phorbol dibutirate (PDBu, 10-8 M) and ionomycin (IM, 5 x 10(-7) M) induce the long-lasting increase (during 48 h) in the number of CD25+ cells. Only in competent (not in resting) lymphocytes, pretreated by submitogenic doses of PHA (1 microg/ml), interleukin-2 (IL-2) is capable to induce the time-dependent CD25 expression. When comparing the time course of CD25+ expression and the blasttransformation it was found that the CD25 markers were revealed on small stimulated lymphocytes and all the large blasts were the CD+ cells with high-affinity alphabetagamma(c) receptor for IL-2. In conclusion, the expression of alpha-subunit of IL-2R takes place during the IL-2-dependent stage of T cell proliferation and may be directly induced by IL-2 via IL-2R.",M1
19637224,"Fetal BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells promote the expansion of human Th17 cells, but inhibit the production of Th1 cells.Th type 17 (Th17) cells have been identified as a proinflammatory T-cell subset. Here, we investigated the regulation of human Th17 cells by fetal BM-derived mesenchymal stem cells (FBM-MSC). We cocultured FBM-MSC with human PBMC or CD4(+) T cells from healthy donors. FBM-MSC significantly suppressed the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells stimulated by <e>PHA</e> and recombinant IL-2. Significantly higher levels of IL-17 were observed in FBM-MSC cocultured with either PBMC or CD4(+) T cells than that in PBMC cultured alone or CD4(+) T cells cultured alone. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of Th17 cells in coculture of FBM-MSC and CD4(+) T cells was significantly higher than that in CD4(+) T-cell cultured alone. FBM-MSC did not express IL-17 protein. Consistent with the augmentation of Th17 cells, significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1 were observed in coculture of FBM-MSC and CD4(+) T cells than that in CD4(+) T-cell culture, while the levels of IL-23 were similar between FBM-MSC + PBMC coculture and PBMC alone, or FBM-MSC + CD4(+) T-cell and CD4(+) T-cell alone. The presence of FBM-MSC decreased the percentage of Th1 cells, but minimally affected the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that FBM-MSC promote the expansion of Th17 cells and decrease IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells. These data suggest that IL-6 and IL-1, instead of IL-23, may be partly involved in the expansion of Th17 cells.",M1
19632243,"Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulates lymphocyte activation.AIMS: Even though the presence of alpha7 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) in lymphocytes has been demonstrated, its functional role still remains elusive. The aim of our study was to characterize alpha7 nAChRs in human lymphocytes upon phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) stimulation. MAIN METHODS: Lymphocytes were activated with the mitogen PHA. alpha7 nAChRs were studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real time PCR, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The effects of nicotinic drugs on PHA-induced proliferation was evaluated by the [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay. KEY FINDINGS: We show that the expression of functional alpha7 receptors increases after PHA stimulation. The activation of peripheral lymphocytes by PHA increases 2.2-fold the alpha7 subunit mRNA expression and 4-fold the binding of the antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) with respect to non activated lymphocytes. By measuring the increase of intracellular calcium in response to nicotine we determine that alpha7 receptors in lymphocytes are functional. Nicotinic drugs differentially modulate T cell activation. While nicotine tends to inhibit proliferative responses, specific alpha7 antagonists, such as alpha-BTX and methyllycaconitine, enhance cell division. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that the alpha7 receptor modulates lymphocyte activation and contributes to clarifying the role of the non neuronal cholinergic system in the immune response.",M1
19605669,"Increased spontaneous but decreased mitogen-stimulated expression and excretion of interleukin 18 by mononuclear cells in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.OBJECTIVE: To measure serum concentration and analyze the expression of interleukin 18 (IL-18) mRNA in mononuclear cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: IL-18 concentrations in sera and culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy controls and patients with active SLE were measured by ELISA. PBMC and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) purified from patients with active SLE were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Expression of IL-18 mRNA in cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Serum IL-18 levels were significantly higher in SLE patients than in controls, and correlated with disease activity in SLE patients (r(2) = 0.602). Two patients receiving intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (1.0 g/day for 3 days) showed profound decreases in serum IL-18 levels after therapy. The quiescent PBMC from SLE patients (30/30) expressed IL-18 transcript more frequently than control PBMC (20/30). PBMC from SLE patients produced more IL-18 than control PBMC after 72 hours of incubation, by RT-PCR. PHA and PWM inhibited the production of IL-18 in PBMC from both SLE patients and controls. Inhibition by PWM was more pronounced than that by PHA, especially in SLE-PBMC. Control and SLE-PMN with or without LPS stimulation produced negligible IL-18. CONCLUSION: IL-18 is involved in the autoimmune derangement of leukocyte function in patients with active SLE.",M1
19583700,"Cell-mediated immunity and multi-locus heterozygosity in bluethroat nestlings.Recent evidence suggests that marker-based heterozygosity-fitness correlations may be driven by only one or a few markers, indicating local heterozygosity effects caused by linkage disequilibrium with functional genes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between microsatellite heterozygosity and a measure of cell-mediated immunity (phytohaemagglutinin; <e>PHA</e>) in bluethroat (Luscinia s. svecica) nestlings using a full-sibling design. We found significant positive associations between PHA response and two different indices of microsatellite heterozygosity, i.e. multi-locus heterozygosity and mean d(2). However, model comparisons disclosed that both associations were more likely caused by local effects rather than general effects and that the two local effects appeared to be realized through two different genetic mechanisms. Our results indicate that both the random assortment of parental chromosomes during meiosis as well as inbreeding can drive heterozygosity-fitness correlations.",M1
19554267,"The influence of JNK and P38 MAPK inhibition on IL-12P40 and IL-23 production depending on IL12B promoter polymorphism.The interleukin-12p40 gene (IL12B) encodes the p40 polypeptide chain, which, together with p19, composes IL-23. A bi-allelic promoter polymorphism (IL12Bpro) located at -2703 bp of the transcription initiation site has been reported to show associations with IL-12p40 production. To elucidate the dependence of IL-12p40 and IL-23 production on IL12Bpro polymorphism in relation to MAPK signal transduction pathways, we examined the effect of JNK and p38 inhibition on the secretion of these cytokines by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors with 1.1 and 1.2/2.2 IL12Bpro genotypes. Stimulation with LPS and C3bgp resulted in approximately equal IL-12p40 production from PBMC with the 1.1 and 1.2/2.2 genotypes. The inhibition of JNK and p38 before stimulation significantly upregulated IL-12p40 production by PBMC with the 1.1 genotype, but did not influence IL-12p40 production from PBMC with the 1.2/2.2 genotype. Cultures of PBMC with the 1.1 genotype produced significantly more IL-12p40 than PBMC with the 1.2/2.2 genotype after stimulation with <e>PHA</e>. Inhibition of p38 kinase upregulated p40 production only in cultures with the 1.1 genotype. Decreased IL-23 production was observed in C3bgp-stimulated cultures after the inhibition of p38 regardless of the genotype of the tested cells. We concluded that IL-12p40 and IL-23 expression, which is mediated by the p38 and JNK intracellular signaling pathways, is influenced by IL12Bpro polymorphism.",M1
19545739,"Immunosuppressive effects of emodin: an in vivo and in vitro study.OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the immunosuppressive effects of emodin and its potential in vivo and in vitro mechanisms. METHODS: In vitro immunosuppressive effects of emodin were analyzed by its ability to suppress the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and to mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC). We examined changes in interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 in within MLC supernates. The in vivo immunosuppressive effects of emodin were analyzed using a skin transplantation model in mice. We also investigated the mean survival time (MST) and plasma IL-2 levels. RESULTS: In vitro experiments: Responses of mononuclear cells to PHA and MLC were suppressed by emodin treatment. Decreased production of IL-2 along with promoted secretion of IL-4 was also observed by emodin treatment during MLC. In vivo experiments: The emodin-treated group showed prolonged MST of skin grafts and decreased serum IL-2 production. CONCLUSIONS: Emodin showed immunosuppressive activities both in vivo and in vitro. The potential immunosuppressive mechanism of emodin's may be suppression of lymphocyte proliferation and influences on cytokines.",M1
19522737,"Evidence of immune system melatonin production by two pineal melatonin deficient mice, C57BL/6 and Swiss strains.We evaluated two pineal melatonin deficient mice described in the literature, i.e., C57BL/6 and Swiss mice, as animal models for studying the immunomodulatory action of melatonin. Plasma melatonin levels in C57BL/6 and Swiss strains were detectable, but lower than levels in control C3H/HENHSD mice. Since these strains are suppose to be pineal melatonin deficient an extrapineal melatonin synthesis may contribute to plasma levels. Regarding cells and tissues from the immune system, all of them were found to synthesize melatonin although at low levels. N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) mRNA was also amplified in order to analyze the alternative splicing between exons 3-4 described for pineal C57BL/6 mice which generates an inclusion of a pseudoexon of 102 bp. For the pineal gland, both the wild type and the mutant isoforms were present in all mice strains although in different proportions. We observed a predominant wild type AANAT mature RNA in thymus, spleen and bone marrow cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture shown an evident AANAT amplification in all strains studied. Although the bands detected were less intense in melatonin deficient mice, the amplification almost reached the control cell intensity after stimulation with phytohemaglutinin (<e>PHA</e>). In summary, melatonin detection and AANAT mRNA expression in inbred and outbred mice clearly indicate that different cells and tissues from the immune system are able to synthesize melatonin. Thus, the pineal defect seems not to be generalized to all tissues, suggesting that other cells may compensate the low pineal melatonin production contributing to the measurable plasma melatonin level.",M1
19505399,"Structure and function of the nicotinic arm of acetylcholine regulatory axis in human leukemic T cells.Although acetylcholine (ACh) is widely known as a neurotransmitter, it also functions as a local humoral factor translating environmental stimuli into alterations in T cell development and function. The cholinergic components present in neurons are expressed in T cells where they constitute an independent cholinergic system. Both non-immunologic and immunologic stimulations can alter expression and function of cholinergic elements in T cells. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated regulation of immune system by auto/paracrine ACh, which provides a basis for development of new immunomodulatory therapies with nicotinic agonists. The purpose of our research is to integrate information about the structure and activity of the ACh regulatory axis with the phenotypic and functional alterations of T cells during their development and commitment. In this study, we used the Ach producing human leukemic T cell line CCRF-CEM (CEM) to investigate auto/paracrine mechanisms of T cell regulation through the nicotinic class of ACh receptors (nAChRs). The intact CEM expressed alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, alpha7, alpha 9, beta2 and beta4 nAChR subunits. Stimulation of CEM with 10 microg/ml of phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) for 16 h upregulated expression of the alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, alpha9 and beta2 and downregulated that of alpha6 and beta4 subunits, indicating that TCR activation leads to overexpression of high Ca2+-permeable ACh-gated ion channels. Activation of alpha7- and alpha3 AChRs predominantly abrogated PHA-dependent upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma receptors, respectively, at the mRNA and protein levels. Signaling through alpha7 and alpha3 nAChRs also significantly (p&lt;0.05) altered expression of the cell state regulators p21 and Bcl-2, respectively, suggesting that downregulation of inflammation via nAChRs includes effects on the T cell cycle progression and apoptosis. These findings indicate that constant stimulation of alpha7 and alpha3 nAChRs by endogenously released ACh controls T cell activation and that signaling downstream of distinct nAChR subtypes targets specific inflammatory and cell cycle genes. Learning the cholinergic pharmacology of inflammation should allow to regulate specific types of immune reactions by selectively activating or blocking the types of nAChRs expressed by the immune cells mediating specific immune reactions.",M1
19498278,"Effect of body condition score of the dairy cow on the in vitro immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to progesterone stimulation.Immune function in cows is closely associated with their physical and hormonal conditions. In order to clarify the relationship between the body condition score (BCS) of lactating dairy cows and the immune response to progesterone (P(4)) in vitro, we examined whether lower BCS in dairy cows affects the responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to P(4) added in to culture medium. Forty-two non-pregnant healthy Holstein dairy cows were examined at 61 to 120 days after calving. The cows were divided into the following two groups; Low BCS group (N=20), which had a BCS of less than 2.25, and a Control group (N=22), which had a BCS over 2.75. PBMCs were stimulated with P(4) (1 microg/mL) and/or phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), and the levels of cytokine mRNA were analyzed. In the Low BCS group, a significantly lower IFN-gamma level was stimulated by PHA only compared with the Control group. The combination of P(4) and PHA significant decreased the IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio in the Control group, but this reaction was not found in the Low BCS group. Our data indicated that expression of IFN-gamma mRNA was basically lower in the low BCS dairy cows and that addition of P(4) did not suppress the cellular immune function in these cows. In this study, we observed that P(4) reduced the cellular immune response in the adequate BCS cows, whereas immunosuppression by P(4) was not found in the PBMCs of the low BCS cows, which already had a lower level of immune function.",M1
19482998,"Is testosterone immunosuppressive in a condition-dependent manner? An experimental test in blue tits.In this experiment we manipulated testosterone (T) and condition in juvenile male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) during the moult, to test whether T's supposed immunosuppressive qualities are condition-dependent. To achieve this, we used T and control implants in combination with a dietary manipulation. We measured responses to both phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and humoral immune challenges during the period of the treatments (moult) and also in the following breeding season (spring). During moult, males fed the enhanced diet were in better condition but there was no difference in humoral response between the dietary groups. T males produced a greater humoral antibody response than control (C) males. In the spring, males that had been previously treated with high T again exhibited higher antibody responses than C males. High T levels during moult were associated with a low PHA response but only in males with low body mass: heavier males that had high T exhibited the highest PHA responses. In the spring, the pattern of PHA responses was reversed; responses were highest in males that had low body mass but also had high T levels, and the lowest responses were by males that had both high T and were relatively heavy. Our results suggest that the effects of T on immunity can be either immunoenhancing or immunosuppressive, depending upon the condition of the individual, its life history stage, as well as on the immune challenge employed.",M1
19479058,"Role of interferon gamma release assay in active TB diagnosis among HIV infected individuals.BACKGROUND: A rapid and specific test is urgently needed for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis especially among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) in active tuberculosis patients who were positive for HIV infection and compared it with that of tuberculin skin test (TST). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 105 HIV-TB patients who were naïve for anti tuberculosis and anti retroviral therapy were included for this study out of which 53 (50%) were culture positive. Of 105 tested, QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube (QFT-G) was positive in 65% (95% CI: 56% to 74%), negative in 18% (95% CI: 11% to 25%) and indeterminate in 17% (95% CI: 10% to 24%) of patients. The sensitivity of QFT-G remained similar in pulmonary TB and extra-pulmonary TB patients. The QFT-G positivity was not affected by low CD4 count, but it often gave indeterminate results especially in individuals with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/microl. All of the QFT-G indeterminate patients whose sputum culture were positive, showed &lt; or = 0.25 IU/ml of IFN-gamma response to phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>). TST was performed in all the 105 patients and yielded the sensitivity of 31% (95% CI: 40% to 22%). All the TST positives were QFT-G positives. The sensitivity of TST was decreased, when CD4 cell counts declined. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows neither QFT-G alone or in combination with TST can be used to exclude the suspicion of active TB disease. However, unlike TST, QFT-G yielded fewer false negative results even in individuals with low CD4 count. The low PHA cut-off point for indeterminate results suggested in this study (&lt; or = 0.25 IU/ml) may improve the proportion of valid QFT-G results.",M1
19469892,"Atopic dermatitis in adults: evaluation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation response to Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins A and B and analysis of interleukin-18 secretion.BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease with a high prevalence and complex pathogenesis. The skin of AD patients is usually colonized by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus); its exotoxins may trigger or enhance the cutaneous inflammation. Several mediators are related to the AD immune imbalance and interleukin-18 (IL-18), an inflammatory cytokine, may play a role in the atopic skin inflammation. AIMS: To evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation response to staphylococcal enterotoxins A (SEA) and B (SEB) and the levels of IL-18 in adults with AD. METHODS: Thirty-eight adult patients with AD and 33 healthy controls were analysed. PBMC were stimulated with SEA and SEB, phytohemaglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), pokeweed (PWM), tetanus toxoid (TT) and Candida albicans (CMA). IL-18 secretion from PBMC culture supernatants and sera were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: A significant inhibition of the PBMC proliferation response to SEA, PHA, TT and CMA of AD patients was detected (P &lt; or = 0.05). Furthermore, increased levels of IL-18 were detected both in sera and non-stimulated PBMC culture supernatants from AD patients (P &lt; or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A decreased PBMC proliferation response to distinct antigens and mitogens (TT, CMA, SEA and PHA) in adults with AD suggest a compromised immune profile. IL-18 secretion from AD upon stimulation was similar from controls, which may indicate a diverse mechanism of skin inflammation maintained by Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, augmented IL-18 secretion from AD sera and non-stimulated cell culture may enhance the immune dysfunction observed in AD, leading to constant skin inflammation.",M1
19452347,"A new agent for tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibition: In vitro effects of dipyridamole in Crohn's disease.BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in inflammatory cascade in Crohn's disease (CD). Our study aims to investigate the in vitro effects of dipyridamole (DP) on the TNF-alpha and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in the intestinal mononuclear cells of CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with CD and in 17 healthy individuals underwent colonoscopy and biopsy samples were taken. Cultured mononuclear cells were preincubated with DP1 (0.7 microg/ml), DP2 (1.25 microg/ml), methotrexate (MTX)1 (0.5 nmol/L) and MTX2 (1.5 nmol/L). These cells were then stimulated with lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>). The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in supernatants were measured with standard immunoassay monoclonal antibody method. RESULTS: An appropriate cell culture could be obtained in 10 patients with CD and 12 healthy individuals. In LPS stimulated cells, MTX1 and MTX2 were superior to DP1 and DP2 in suppressing TNF-alpha in both groups. In PHA stimulated cells, while MTX1 was superior to DP1, MTX2 and DP2 had an equivalent effect in CD patients (p&lt;0.05, p&gt;0.05, respectively). In LPS-stimulated cells DP2 was significantly superior to MTX2 in increasing IL-10 levels in both groups (p&lt;0.05). In PHA stimulated cells, DP1 and DP2 caused a higher increase in IL-10 levels compared with MTX1 and MTX2 in CD group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Dipyridamole suppresses TNF-alpha similar with MTX. It seems to be superior to MTX in increasing IL-10 levels. Addition of DP to anti-TNF medications may create a synergy in cytokine modulation.",M1
19444603,"High levels of E4-<e>PHA</e>-reactive oligosaccharides: potential as marker for cells with characteristics of hepatic progenitor cells.Oligosaccharides serve as markers of the cell surface and have been used as certain kinds of tumor markers. In the present study, we established a simple method for isolating hepatic progenitor cells using a lectin, which recognizes a characteristic oligosaccharide structure. Rat liver epithelial (RLE) cells, which have been established as a hepatic stem-like cell, were used to identify characteristic oligosaccharide structures on hepatic stem cells. As a result from lectin micro array, several types of lectin including E4-PHA were identified to bind RLE cells specifically. Furthermore, lectin blot and lectin flow cytometry analyses showed that binding to E(4)-PHA lectin was significantly increased in RLE cells, compared to hepatocytes, and hepatoma cells. The induction of differentiation into a hepatocyte lineage of RLE cells by treatment with Oncostatin M and dexamethasone resulted in a decrease in E(4)-PHA binding. Using an E(4)-PHA column, we succeeded in isolating hepatic stem cells from LEC (Long-Evans with cinnamon coat color) rat livers with fluminant hepatitis. The characteristics of the established cells were similar to RLE cells and had a potential of proliferating in rat liver. These results suggest that oligosaccharides can serve as a novel marker for the isolation of the hepatic progenitor cells.",M1
19443139,"Infectivity of pestivirus following persistence of acute infection.Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is an endemic pathogen worldwide and eradication strategies focus on the identification and removal of persistently infected (PI) animals arising after in utero infection. Despite this, acute infections with BVDV can persist for months or years after the removal of the PI source despite repeated screening for PIs and tight biosecurity measures. Recent evidence for a prolonged duration of viraemia in the testicles of bulls following acute BVDV infection suggests the possibility of a form of chronic persistence that may more closely resemble the persistence strategies of hepatitis C virus (HCV). To investigate the potential for virus transmission from infected and recovered cattle to virus naïve hosts we established an acute infection of 5 BVDV-naïve calves and monitored animals over 129 days. Infectious BVDV was detected in white blood cells between days 3 and 7 post-challenge. The animals seroconverted by day 21 post-infection and subsequently were apparently immune and free from infectious virus and viral antigen. Animals were further monitored and purified white blood cells were stimulated in vitro with phytohaemagglutinin A (<e>PHA</e>) during which time BVDV RNA was detected intermittently. Ninety-eight days following challenge, blood was transferred from these apparently virus-free and actively immune animals to a further group of 5 BVDV-naïve calves and transmission of infection was achieved. This indicates that BVDV-infected, recovered and immune animals have the potential to remain infectious for BVDV-naïve cohorts for longer than previously demonstrated.",M1
19439187,"Sub-mitogenic phorbol myristate acetate co-stimulation rescues the <e>PHA</e>-induced activation of both naïve and memory T cells cultured in the rotating-wall vessel bioreactor.T lymphocytes are unresponsive to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation during culture in spaceflight or ground-based microgravity analogs such as the rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The TCR-induced activation of a subset of T cells can be rescued in the RWV by co-stimulation with sub-mitogenic doses of phorbol ester (PMA). We report that PMA co-stimulation of primary human T cells cultured in the RWV rescues the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced activation of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets as well as naïve and memory CD4+ T cells. Importantly, T cells activated in the RWV by PHA+PMA contained these subsets in proportions strikingly similar to control cultures activated with PHA alone. The data indicate that rescuing T cell activation with PMA co-stimulation does not significantly perturb the heterogeneity of the responding cells, and represent an important proof of principle for the design of immune-boosting agents for use in spaceflight.",M1
19433108,"TH1/TH2 balance in concomitant immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity diseases.In spite of the observation of mutual inhibitory properties of TH1 and TH2 CD4+ cells, a group of patients developed simultaneously immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that are theoretically antagonistic. Patients presenting concomitant hypersensitivity reactions were evaluated for cytokine production. PBMC from 45 patients and 13 non-atopic individuals were cultured with mite allergen and mitogen and the supernatants obtained were evaluated for cytokine production by ELISA. The analysis of the cytokines levels revealed increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in the non-atopic individuals after specific and mitogen stimulus. The IL-4 was largely observed on serum samples and IL-5 levels were higher in the double sensitized group (group DerpNi) after <e>PHA</e> stimulus. The IL-13 levels were increased in sensitized groups (Derp and DerpNi groups) after PHA stimuli. Atopic patients (Derp and DerpNi groups) presented lowest levels IFN-gamma and the analysis of TGF-beta production after rDER P I stimulation have shown increased levels among sensitized patients to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus mite. IL-10 levels did not differ after antigen stimulation but basal production was higher on Derp and DerpNi groups. Furthermore, negative correlations were observed between IFN-gamma levels and IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10. This study has shown patients able to react, concomitantly, to the two types of antigens - rDER P I and NiSO4, present distinct pattern of cytokine production. The increased levels of IL-13 in the sensitive individuals to mite antigen (rDER P I) and IFN-gamma in NiSO4 sensitized individuals confirm the role of the type TH2 response in the atopies and TH1 type in DCA.",M1
19423178,"Factors affecting red deer skin test responsiveness to bovine and avian tuberculin and to phytohaemagglutinin.We studied the effect of management on the responsiveness of red deer (Cervus elaphus) to skin testing with mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial antigens. We hypothesized that individuals from populations of the same species under different management conditions would have a different immune responsiveness. Deer sampled in this study included 1041 adult animals from 6 Spanish farms and 111 adult wild deer. We injected four sites of the neck with 0.1 ml bovine purified protein derivative (PPD), 0.1 ml avian PPD, 0.1 ml negative control PBS and 0.1 ml of Phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>, containing 250 microg) as positive control, and measured the skin fold increase at time 72 h. Bovine PPD reactors were identified in 5 of 6 farms and among wild deer. Apparent prevalence among wild deer (18.9%) was not significantly higher than among farmed deer (14.5%). Avian PPD reactors were found among all 7 study populations, but apparent prevalence was lower among wild deer (&lt;1%) than among farmed deer (12.6%; p&lt;0.001). Deer management (farmed versus wild) was identified as a key factor affecting deer skin fold thickness increase in response both to mycobacterial (bPPD and aPPD) and non-mycobacterial antigens (PHA). The differences occurred in the same sense, regardless of some interactions; farmed deer showing higher values. The PHA skin fold increase was not affected by the PPD skin test results. We propose that using PHA as a positive control may help in the interpretation of between-population differences in tuberculin responses.",M1
19401324,"Mifepristone acts as progesterone antagonist of non-genomic responses but inhibits phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation in human T cells.BACKGROUND: Progesterone is an endogenous immunomodulator that suppresses T cell activation during pregnancy. The stimulation of membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) would seem to be the cause of rapid non-genomic responses in human peripheral T cells, such as an elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and decreased intracellular pH (pH(i)). Mifepristone (RU486) produces mixed agonist/antagonist effects on immune cells compared with progesterone. We explored whether RU486 is an antagonist to mPRs and can block rapid non-genomic responses and the induction by phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) of cell proliferation. METHODS: Human male peripheral T cell responses in terms of pH(i) and [Ca(2+)](i) changes were measured using the fluorescent dyes, 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and fura-2, respectively. Expression of mPR mRNA was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity were determined by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, respectively. RESULTS: The mRNAs of mPRalpha, mPRbeta and mPRgamma were expressed in T cells. RU486 blocked progesterone-mediated rapid responses including, the [Ca(2+)](i) increase and pH(i) decrease, in a dose related manner. RU486 did not block, but enhanced, the inhibitory effect of progesterone on PHA induced cell proliferation. RU486 alone inhibited proliferation induced by PHA and at &gt;25 microM seems to be cytotoxic against resting T cells (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: RU486 is antagonistic to the rapid mPR-mediated non-genomic responses, but is synergistic with progesterone with respect to the inhibition of PHA-induced cell proliferation. Our findings shine new light on RU486's clinical application and how this relates to the non-genomic rapid physiological responses caused by progesterone.",M1
19376954,"Dynamics of <e>PHA</e>-induced immune response and plasma carotenoids in birds: should we have a closer look?Allocation trade-offs of limited resources are thought to ensure the honesty of sexual signals and are often studied using controlled immune challenges. One such trade-off between immunity and ornaments is that involving carotenoids. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune response is a widely used immune challenge, yet more details on the underlying physiological mechanisms and potential costs are needed. We investigated the temporal dynamics of PHA-induced immune response and associated changes in blood carotenoids, body mass and a carotenoid-based coloured signal. We found variation in individual response patterns to PHA after peak swelling was reached, with birds showing either a rapid or a slow subsequent decrease in swelling, suggesting variation in the duration of the immune response and/or inflammation. Body mass did not affect immune response. Plasma carotenoids followed a transient decrease closely matching the dynamics of the swelling. The peak of the immune response was negatively related to initial plasma carotenoid levels and positively correlated to the relative decrease in plasma carotenoids. Individual variation in duration of the swelling could be partly explained by plasma carotenoids; high initial carotenoid levels were associated with a slower decrease of the swelling. These contradictory effects of carotenoids suggest a complex role in the immune response. Bill colour was positively correlated to initial plasma carotenoid concentration but it did not predict or change as a consequence of immune response to PHA. Bill colour thus reflects medium- or long-term quality rather than immediate quality. Taking into account the dynamics of the immune response and that of associated physiological parameters would thus yield new insights into our interpretation of variation in PHA response.",M1
19346007,"In vitro effect of vitamin E on lectin-stimulated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.In order to analyze the effect of vitamin E on Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy pigs (n=8) and cultured with either 0, 10, 50, or 100muM of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). PBMC were stimulated with <e>PHA</e> for either, 24h to determine: (a) the concentration of tocopherol incorporated into the cell membrane, (b) cytokine production and (c) Th1 and Th2 regulators gene expression; or 72h to determine the proliferation of PBMC. Vitamin E was incorporated into the PBMC in a dose dependent manner, giving as a result a high proliferation of cells irrespective of the dose of vitamin E used. Regarding cytokine production, vitamin E consistently decreases the mRNA expression and the percentage of cells producing IL-10. Vitamin E did not influence the production of IFN-gamma but the lowest level of vitamin E (10muM) was sufficient to maximally increase the proportion of cells producing IL-2, to diminish IL-4, and discreetly increase the mRNA expression of TBX21 vs. GATA3. In conclusion, our results revealed that vitamin E is able to suppress IL-10 production and to influence the production of IL-2, IL-4, and maybe TBX21. Vitamin E clearly has immunomodulatory effects, though further work in vivo to determine the physiological nature of these effects is warranted.",M1
19330626,"Immunomodulatory activities of various medicinal plant extracts: effects on human lymphocytes apoptosis.Plant extracts have been widely evaluated for biological properties. In the present study extracts of several native plants in Iran was investigated for their possible immunomodulatory effects. Peripheral blood lymphocytes separated from healthy individuals were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and cultured with different concentrations of the extracts. Comparison of the cell proliferation in treated cultures showed the highest inhibitory effect due to exposure with Linum persicum. This extract caused a strong dose-dependent decrease in lymphocyte proliferation (p &lt; 0.001). Lymphocytes treated with Cirsium bracteosum were inhibited in a dose dependent manner (SI range 0.9-0.2). Similarly, Echinophora cinerea-treated lymphocytes showed a significant reduction in proliferation compared to that in non-treated cells. Among the extracts, Dionysia termeana, Salvia macrociphon and Ferulago angulata had a mild stimulatory effect on the lymphocytes at concentrations less than 1 microg/ml (p &lt; 0.05). At higher doses all these extracts showed significant inhibitory effects on the proliferation of PHA-treated cells (SI range 0.81 to 0.04). In cell cycle analysis performed by flow cytometry, the strongest appearance of apoptotic cells at sub-G1 phase in various extract-treated cultures was found for D. termeana (14.6 +/- 0.5%). The Percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis in cultures treated with L. persicum was more than 11 compared to that of the control (1.7 +/- 0.08). In DNA analysis, D. termeana and L. persicum showed typical DNA laddering, indicating that these extracts induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. In conclusion, all the extracts studied showed lymphocyte inhibitory effects at high concentrations. These inhibitory effects for some of the plants seem to be due to induction of apoptosis.",M1
19300393,"Epicatechin suppresses IL-6, IL-8 and enhances IL-10 production with NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in whole blood stimulated system.OBJECTIVES: Cytokines induce the balance between inflammatory versus regulatory or antibody mediated reactions. So modulating the release of cytokines or inducing them by immunomodulating agents is an attractive mode for treating or help in treating several diseases such as autoimmune diseases. Eriobotrya japonica is a plant that is traditionally thought to have anti-inflammatory activities. Several compounds were isolated from the plant and showed distinctive biological effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of epicatechin (EC) isolated from Eriobotrya Japonica on IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 productions in whole blood stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)+lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and to examine if these cytokines are modulated through NFkappaB pathway. METHODS: Sixteen healthy males and females volunteered in the study. Blood samples were drawn, diluted, and cultured for 24 h with different concentrations of EC and then PHA+LPS was added for another 24 h. The supernatant, then, was harvested and assayed for cytokines. In addition, mixing studies of EC and hydrocortisone were performed to examine the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of NFkB levels in association with cytokine production levels. RESULTS: Increasing concentrations of EC (1-100 microg/ml) in PHA+LPS stimulated whole blood cells culture suppressed significantly (p&lt;0.001) the production of IL-6 and IL-8. Moreover, increasing concentrations of EC modulated significantly the production of IL-10, as there was a significant increase in IL-10 level at 0.1, 1.0, and 10 microg/ml (p=0.058-0.004), while a significant decrease at a concentration of 100 microg/ml EC (p=0.037) was observed. In addition, an additive effect between EC and hydrocortisone (HC, 100 nmol/l) was seen in the production of IL-10, as there was a significant increase in IL-10 level (32%) compared with 27% for EC (10 microg/ml) and 19% HC. Furthermore, a significant decrease in cytoplasmic fractions of NFkappaB p65 level was found in samples containing EC 1, 10 microg/ml, but not in 100 microg/ml, when compared with control (p&lt;0.03). These latter changes were accompanied with a 29%, 67%, and 98% increase, respectively, of NFkappaB p65 in nuclear fractions compared to 24% reduction of NFkappaB p65 level in HC culture (p&lt;0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that EC suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL6 and IL-8, enhances the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and stimulates NFkappaB p65 translocation to nucleus in PHA+LPS stimulated whole blood culture.",M1
19293476,"The influence of iron loading and iron chelation on the proliferation and telomerase activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential trace element in cell proliferation. Several investigations demonstrate that iron deprivation inhibits cell proliferation. However, the impact of iron on telomerase activity of activated lymphocytes remains unexplained to date. OBJECTIVE: In this study, the effect of iron on the proliferation and telomerase activity of lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) were investigated. METHODS: Iron loading was performed by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 500microM FeSO4.7H2O for 24 h and iron chelation was done by exposing cells to desferrioxamine, a potent iron chelator. The effects of silymarin, a flavonoid with both antioxidant and iron chelating activities, on the proliferation and telomerase activity of PHA-activated lymphocytes were also compared with desferrioxamine. Proliferation and telomerase activity were assessed using BrdU incorporation assay and Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP), respectively. RESULTS: The proliferations of lymphocytes were significantly inhibited by 10 and 20 microg/ml desferrioxamine in a dose dependent manner, while iron loading recovered suppressed cell proliferation to the normal level. Silymarin at 20 microg/ml significantly increased the proliferation of lymphocytes in both normal and iron-treated conditions. Telomerase activity of lymphocytes was markedly increased by iron treatment and suppressed by desferrioxamine. Conversely, iron treatment had no effect on the telomerase activity of lymphocytes incubated with silymarin. CONCLUSION: Iron plays a significant role in the proliferation and telomerase activity of lymphocytes. The effects of silymarin on the proliferation and telomerase activity of lymphocytes were completely different from those of desferrioxamine, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of silymarin is probably not associated with its iron chelating activity.",M1
19231022,"Comparative analysis of cell parameter groups for breast cancer detection.We present a method for the comparative analysis of parameter groups according to their correlation to disease. The theoretical basis of the proposed method is Information Theory and Nonparametric Statistics. Normalized mutual information is used as the measure of correlation between parameters, and statistical conclusions are based on ranking. The fluorescence polarization (FP) parameter is considered as the principal diagnostic characteristic. The FP was measured in fluorescein diacetate (FDA)-stained individual peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), derived from healthy subjects and breast cancer (BC) patients, under different stimulation conditions: by tumor tissue, the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) or without the stimulants. The FP parameters were grouped according to their correlation with breast cancer. It was established that the greatest difference between cells of BC patients and healthy subjects is found in the PHA test (parameter P1).",M1
19224667,"Fibroblasts from the new-born male testicle of Guangxi Bama mini-pig ( Sus scrofa) can support nuclear transferred embryo development in vitro.Miniature pigs are valuable for research in xenotransplantation and as models for investigating human diseases. Although many mammalian species have been cloned, the success rates have been very low, especially in the pig. In the present study, an attempt was made to optimize somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) protocols for use in the production of the Guangxi Bama mini-pig. Firstly, mini-pig fibroblast cells from a new-born Guangxi Bama piglet were isolated and cultured. Cell type was identified by fluorescence immunocytochemistry (ICC); the cells expressed cimentin, but not cytoceratin and follicular stimulation hormone receptor (FSHR). Secondly, the optimal cell cycle synchronization protocol for treating fibroblast cells from the newborn piglet's testicle was investigated by contact inhibition and serum starvation. When fibroblast cells were treated by contact inhibition, a higher fusion (66.0% vs. 58.3%, p &gt; 0.05) and blastocyst production (20.8% vs. 15.1, p &gt; 0.05) rates were obtained than with serum starvation. Thirdly, to examine the ability of old cells to be morphologically remodelled after activation, testicular fibroblasts (passage 10-14) were introduced into enucleated oocytes; enlarged nuclei were formed in most of the reconstructed embryos at 6 h and enlarged nuclei or distinct pseudopronuclei were formed in nearly all the reconstructed embryos at 12 h. The old donor cell could be morphologically remodelled correctly and was competent to support embryo development to the blastocyst in vitro. Fourthly, the in vitro development potential of the cloned embryos was investigated using two types of donor cell: ear fibroblasts and low or high passage testicular fibroblasts. The rate of fusion was highest using low passage testicle fibroblasts (84.5% vs. 69.8% and 80.0%, p &lt; 0.05), as was development to the blastocyst stage (14.6% vs. 7.7% and 6.3%, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, the effect of phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) on parthenogenetic and cloned embryo development was examined. The PHA had no significant effect on the parthenogenetic embryos, but cloned embryo development to the blastocyst stage was significantly increased by PHA (10 microg/ml), (13.4% vs. 5.6% and 5.6%, p &lt; 0.05).",M1
19191889,"The interaction between Helicobacter pylori and atopy: does inverse association really exist?AIM: To date, cross-sectional and case-control studies suggest an inverse association between Helicobacter pylori infection and atopic diseases, whereas the immunologic basis has not been studied yet. In this study we investigated T helper (Th) cell function in H. pylori-infected children and compared cytokine responses in atopic and non-atopic groups. METHODS: The study groups was recruited from a cohort of 327 healthy children evaluated and followed-up for 6 years to assess the natural history of H. pylori infection. Seventy-four of 136 healthy children who underwent (13)C urea breath test were eligible and accepted to participate. All participants were evaluated by a questionnaire, and skin-prick testing. According to the results, children were divided into four groups with respect to the presence or absence of H. pylori and atopy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 34 of 74 children were cultured with H. pylori, Der p 1, and phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) levels were measured in supernatants. RESULTS: The frequency of atopy was lower in H. pylori-infected group (31.9% vs. 48.1, p = .22), while atopic symptoms were similar between infected and non-infected children. While PHA and H. pylori induced IFN-gamma levels were significantly higher in H. pylori-infected children, concomitant presence of both atopy and H. pylori decreased the level of PHA and H. pylori induced IFN-gamma production. PHA and Der p 1-induced IL-4 levels were higher in atopic children, and IL-4 production was suppressed when they were concomitantly infected with H. pylori. The production of TGF-beta was found to be suppressed in atopic children irrespective of the presence of H. pylori infection. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study demonstrated a counteractive Th1 and Th2 cytokine interaction between H. pylori infection and atopy. However, this counteractive immunologic balance did not protect against atopy.",M1
19190764,"Chronic brucellosis patients retain low frequency of CD4+ T-lymphocytes expressing CD25 and CD28 after Escherichia coli LPS stimulation of <e>PHA</e>-cultured PBMCs.Chronic brucellosis patients display a defective Th1 response to PHA. We have previously shown that heat-killed B. abortus (HKBA) can downregulate the PHA-induced increase of CD4+/CD25+ and CD14+/CD80+ cells of brucellosis patients. In the present study, we investigate the effect of E. coli LPS, as a potent stimulant of monocytes and autologous T-lymphocytes, on the PHA-cultured PBMCs of the same groups of patients. Thirteen acute brucellosis (AB) patients, 22 chronic brucellosis (CB) patients, 11  cured  subjects, and 15 healthy volunteers were studied. The percentage of CD4+/CD25+ and CD4+/CD28+ T-lymphocytes as well as CD14+/CD80+ monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry after PBMCs culture with PHA plus E. coli LPS. A significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+/CD25+ and CD4+/CD28+ T-lymphocytes was observed in CB compared to AB. In HKBA cultures, compared to E. coli LPS-cultures, there was a significant reduction of CD4+/CD25+ T-lymphocytes in all groups and CD14+/CD80+ in patients groups. We suggest that Brucella can modulate host immune response, leading to T-cell anergy and chronic infection.",M1
19172486,"A comparison between ((3)H)-thymidine incorporation and isothermal microcalorimetry for the assessment of antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation.Lymphocyte transformation tests (LTT) are time-consuming radioactive assays used in the clinic for the determination of allergic drug reactions and extensively in basic immunological research. In the present study we propose an alternative method in the monitoring of T-cell responses by isothermal microcalorimetric (IMC) measurements of overall cellular heat production as a function of time. For mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, we analyzed a concentration dependent effect of phytohemaglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and both tests showed a good correlation. This was also the case for specific antigenic stimulation with Varidase(R) or tetanus toxoid. On the other hand, antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation analyzed by pre and post influenza vaccine (Inflexal(R) V) samples, showed no such correlation. Our study suggests that IMC measurements, despite the advantages of simplicity, on-line recording of metabolic activity and no use of radioactivity, may be limited to monitoring mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation.",M1
19161399,"Long-term UVB irradiation affects the immune functions of carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).The effects of long-term, low-dose ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on immune functions of two fish species representing different taxonomic groups, carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were assessed in this study. The fish were exposed to 7, 20 or 60 mJ cm(-2) UVB three times per week, for 6 weeks. In carp, UVB exposure affected the respiratory burst activity of blood and head kidney phagocytes, differential blood leukocyte counts and blood chemistry. Phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-stimulated in vitro proliferation responses of blood and head kidney lymphocytes, however, remained unchanged. Rainbow trout tolerated the irradiations with fewer alterations, but significant changes were detected in blood chemistry and hematocrits of the irradiated fish. These results indicate that long-term exposure to low doses of UVB induces immunomodulation in fish, and that there are species-specific differences in sensitivity to irradiation.",M1
19152248,"Clinical utility of the interaction between lectin and serum prostate specific antigen in prostate cancer.The present investigation was a lectin-based diagnosis of malignant prostate cancer (PC) by the interaction of phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e> lectin) from Phaseolus vulgaris with the glycan part of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of patients with prostatic disorder. This was confirmed by the interaction between PHA and purified PSA obtained from serum by electrophoretic separation and finally by HPLC chromatography. The precipitate of carbohydrate content after binding of PHA with purified PSA of PC was significantly higher than that of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and/or normal serum PSA. The results suggest that there may be a striking difference in glycosylation pattern of PSA between BPH and PC. The cut off value &gt; or = 10 microg/ml of the carbohydrate content of PHA-PSA precipitate indicates strong suspicion for PC irrespective of total serum PSA cut off level &gt; or = 4.0 ng/ml by conventional immunoassay method and this may be taken as a guideline in differentiating PC and BPH.

19152151,"Optimizing in vitro conditions for immunomodulation and expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells.BACKGROUND AIMS: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can be expanded in vitro for clinical use and have been evaluated in clinical trials as immunosuppressants and to heal damaged tissues. We investigated the impact of freezing and prolonged storage on cell viability, proliferation and immunosuppression in vitro. METHODS: MSC were expanded from bone marrow (BM) of healthy subjects according to standard protocols in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS). The immunosuppressive potential of MSC was analyzed in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) and after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>). RESULTS: Expansion of frozen mononuclear cells (MNC) diminished MSC yield after expansion compared with plating of fresh MNC. MSC derived from frozen MNC were also less immunosuppressive. MSC harvested at various passages after expansion in vivo suppressed lymphocyte proliferation equally. Pooling of MSC from several donors generated higher and more stable suppression in both MLC and after PHA stimulation. After passage 1, plating at lower densities in 20% FCS increased cell expansion of MSC up to 25-fold compared with standard conditions. CONCLUSIONS: MNC should not be frozen prior to MSC expansion. Decreased replating density and increased FCS levels generate higher numbers of MSC. Freezing of ex vivo-expanded MSC for &gt;30 months did not affect cell viability or the ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation. For effective immunosuppression in vitro MSC should be stored for less than 6 months and pooled from two or three donors.",M1
19144391,"Effect of chromium on the level of IL-12 and IFN-gamma in occupationally exposed workers.Chromium may affect humoral and cellular immunity, acting on T lymphocytes as well as on granulocytes and monocytes cells. Cytokines play an important role in the immune balance. In this study, the level of IL-12 and IFN-gamma were evaluated in the sera and <e>PHA</e>/LPS stimulated culture supernatant of human PBMCs of healthy volunteers and occupationally exposed chromium workers. All the workers were highly exposed to chromium having mean of 104.65+/-77.21 microg/dL (range 23.7-316.8 microg/dL). A suspension of exposed and unexposed human PBMC (0.5x10(6) cells/ml) prepared and cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS for 18 h in the presence or absence of LPS (10 ng/ml) which used for stimulation of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. The level of IL-12 and IFN-gamma were evaluated in the sera samples as well as LPS stimulated and unstimulated culture supernatant of h-PBMCs of chromium exposed workers. In these chromium exposed workers the level of IL-12 was 433.66+/-197.49 pg/ml and 983.45+/-330.99 pg/ml in LPS stimulated culture supernatant of normal individuals and highly chromium exposed workers, which was significant (P&lt;0.05). Although the level of IL-12 was (78.61+/-61.03 pg/ml to 146.52+/-46.37 pg/ml) elevated in unstimulated culture supernatant of h-PBMCs of chromium exposed individuals as compared to control, but it was not significant. This observation also suggests that a significant increase in IFN-gamma production in LPS stimulated and unstimulated culture supernatant of h-PBMCs of chromium exposed workers as compared to control. However, IFN-gamma level have a significant positive correlation between blood chromium level (r=0.833, t=6.3872, P 0.05) and exposure time (in years) (r=0.8916, t=8.3540, P 0.05) of the occupationally exposed workers.",M1
19138532,"Evaluating the effects of immunosuppressants on human immunity using cytokine profiles of whole blood.It is critical to determine the status of the immune system in transplant recipients, but there are currently no clinical methods available to do so. To address this, we have developed an innovative method to evaluate the effects of immunosuppressants that involves measuring phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-stimulated cytokine secretions in vitro in response to treatments with dexamethasone (DEX), FK506 or mycophenolic acid (MPA). The results revealed that DEX nonspecifically and dose-dependently inhibited the production of 12 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-17, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and G-CSF). In contrast, FK506 and MPA selectively inhibited the secretion of IL-2 and IL-13, and MPA unexpectedly increased the production of IL-1beta. Therefore, different immunosuppressants have distinct cytokine signatures that can be used to determine whether there is under- or over-immunosuppression in transplant recipients. Immunosuppressants could be adjusted according to the cytokine profiles to maximize immunosuppressive effects while minimizing the risk of infection.",M1
19121607,"Analysis of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation as a screening tool for cellular immunodeficiency.Measuring lymphocyte response to mitogens and antigens is a mainstay of screening for cellular immunodeficiency. Few reports analyze performance as a screening tool in diverse patient cohorts. We studied proliferation assays performed at Children's Hospital Boston from 1996 to 2003 using mitogens phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), concanavalin A (CONA) and pokeweed mitogen, and antigens tetanus (TT) and diphtheria (DT) toxoids, and compared a subset of patients with T cell dysfunction with adult controls using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were correlated with clinical data. CONA was superior to PHA in identifying patients with immunodeficiency. TT was second best. Interpretation based on raw CPM, a stimulation index, or reference to simultaneous controls all performed equally. Combining data from multiple mitogens and/or antigens did not enhance performance. Proliferation testing is a useful component of screening for cellular immunodeficiency, but is not a sensitive predictor of cellular immune compromise or risk of opportunistic infection.",M1
19107745,"The effect of garlic consumption on Th1/Th2 cytokines in phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) activated rat spleen lymphocytes.The balance and regulation of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2-type cytokines are important in the effective immune response to different diseases. To clarify the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L.) consumption on the Th1/Th2 balance, the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), as two prototypes of Th1/Th2 cytokines, were compared in serum and supernatant of in vitro phytohemagglutinin activated rat spleen lymphocytes. Thirty male rats were divided equally into two groups. The treatment group received garlic solution in water (600 mg/kg/4 mL) and controls received distilled water by gavage. After 1 month, serum and supernatant of PHA activated spleen lymphocytes were analysed for IFN-gamma and IL-4 by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and thymus and spleen weights were measured. The garlic treatment group showed significantly decreased production of IFN-gamma from 101.73 +/- 4.62 to 74.64 +/- 4.64 pg/mL and significantly increased IL-4 production from 26.75 +/- 3.35 to 83.92 +/- 6.56 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.001) in the supernatant of PHA induced spleen lymphocytes. The serum level of these cytokines was undetectable. The mean weight of thymuses in the garlic fed animals was significantly reduced from 0.456 +/- 0.016 to 0.368 +/- 0.023 g compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.005). There were no significant differences between the spleen weights in the two groups. In conclusion, oral garlic treatment may favor a Th2 or humoral immune response.",M1
19104503,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages leads to apoptosis of T cells.The induction of apoptosis of T cells by intracellular pathogen is an attractive hypothesis to explain their persistence in host cells. To test this hypothesis, human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and cocultured with autologous T cells stimulated with nonspecific phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) or specific culture filtrate protein (CFP) of M. tuberculosis. CD95 (Fas) expression, propidium iodide (PI) staining and terminal deoxy nucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay of CD3 cells were studied to assess the viability. Apoptotic cells were correlated with the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). An increased CD3/PI and CD3/CD95(+) PHA-preactivated T cells in coculture with M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages suggested Fas-Fas ligand interactions to be important in apoptosis of nonspecifically stimulated T cells. Significantly higher NO and TNF- alpha levels suggested an association of the soluble factors with apoptosis of nonspecifically activated T cells. Significantly high release of TNF-alpha in the coculture of infected macrophages with CFP-activated T cells pointed toward its association with specific T-cell apoptosis. We show for the first time that in vitro infection of human macrophages with M. tuberculosis induces apoptosis of specific and to a much greater extent of nonspecific T cells.",M1
19100750,"Norcantharidin reduced cyclins and cytokines production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.AIMS: To evaluate potential agents of therapeutic value in tissue inflammation, we studied norcantharidin (NCTD) and its derivatives for their effects on immune responses of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro. MAIN METHODS: PBMC proliferation was evaluated by tritiated thymidine uptake method. The production and gene expression of cytokines were determined with enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Five derivatives from NCTD had no significant effect on cell proliferation in PBMC. NCTD inhibited PBMC proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) 42.1+/-2.3 microM. The inhibitory action of NCTD did not involve direct cytotoxicity. To localize the point in the PBMC proliferation where arrest occurred, a set of key regulatory events leading to the cell proliferation, including cell cycle progression, production and gene expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and cyclins was examined. Data demonstrated NCTD arrested the cell cycle progression of activated PBMC from the G1 transition to the S phase. The cyclin D3, E, A, and B transcripts and protein production in PHA-treated PBMC was reduced by NCTD. Whereas NCTD exerted no effect on IL-4 and IFN-gamma production, it significantly alleviated the production and mRNA expression of IL-2 and IL-10 in activated PBMC. SIGNIFICANCE: The suppressant effects of NCTD on proliferation of PBMC activated by PHA therefore appear to be mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of cyclins and IL-2 production and arrest of cell cycle progression in the cells.",M1
19091070,"Insulin-like growth factor I promotes cord blood T cell maturation through monocytes and inhibits their apoptosis in part through interleukin-6.BACKGROUND: The functional immaturity of T cells contributes to the susceptibility of neonates to infections and the less severe graft-versus-host disease associated with cord blood (CB) transplantation. We have previously reported that insulin-like growth factor - I (IGF-I) promotes the phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-induced CB T cell maturation and inhibits their apoptosis in mononuclear cell (MC) culture. We hypothesized that the effects of IGF-I may be mediated by accessory cells and soluble factors. RESULTS: This study showed that the kinetics of PHA-induced maturation in purified CD3+ T cell was delayed compared to that in CBMC. The addition of autologous CD14+ monocytes increased T cell maturation and potentiated the effect of IGF-I. The addition of IL-6 had no effect on CB T cell maturation but it reduced PHA-induced apoptosis significantly. We further demonstrated that the neutralisation of IL-6 in CBMC culture partially abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 on T cells. The anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 was not mediated via the reduction of Fas expression in T cell subsets. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the maturation effect of IGF-1 is partially mediated by monocytes and the anti-apoptotic effect in part via IL-6. Further investigation is needed to explore the therapeutic use of IGF-I in enhancing neonatal immunity.",M1
19079534,"Morphology and synaptic organization of non-dopaminergic nigral projections to the medio dorsal thalamic nucleus of the rat, a study by anterograde transport of <e>PHA</e>-L.BACKGROUND: Mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus, which is considered to take place between extra pyramidal and limbic feedback circuit, receives projective fibers from ventrolateral neurons of reticular part of substantia nigra (SNr). In order to better understand the influence and chemical reaction of these fibers upon MD nucleus, the morphology and synaptology of them were examined in the present study. METHODS: Phaseolous vulgaris-leucoagglutin (PHA-L) was injected into substantia nigra pars reticulate. After 3-4 days, the sections of SNr injection site and MD nucleus were prepared. Then, we examined organization, morphology and, synaptology of PHA-L labeled SNr fibers that go to caudal and lateral part of MD thalamic nucleus. RESULTS: At the electron microscopic level, the SNr terminals made synapses predominantly with the medium to small dendrites and far less frequently with soma and large dendrites. These terminals were packed with polymorphic synaptic vesicles and formed symmetrical synapses; furthermore, it has been already recognized that cortico straital fibers from sensory-motor cortex go to region of the SNr that give rise to the nigrothalamic fibers. CONCLUSION: This data suggest that upon the synaptic organization, morphology and chemical nature of GABAergic, SNr fibers may have different inhibitory influence on MD neurons regulating the thalamic output from MD to cerebral cortex in the control of limbic and extra pyramidal feedback system.",M1
19067026,"Differential distribution of both IL-12Rbeta chains in the plasma membrane of human T cells.IL-12 is a cytokine that stimulates the expression of CD26, a T cell- and raft-associated ectopeptidase. IL-12 also enhances the interaction between CD26 and CD45RO, which removes the phosphatase CD45RO from raft microdomains. Since Janus kinases are known CD45 substrates, our hypothesis was that this relocation of CD45RO in nonraft areas of the membrane could be important to switch off the signaling via cytokine receptors, e.g., the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R). Accordingly, both IL-12R and CD45RO should be equally positioned in the cell membrane upon IL-12R ligation. However, there were no data available on the membrane distribution of IL-12R on human T cells. Working with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) lymphoblasts, we tried to fill that gap. The high-affinity IL-12R is made of two chains: IL-12Rbeta1 and IL-12Rbeta2. Using flow cytometry, Western blot and confocal microscopy, we obtained data suggesting that IL-12Rbeta1 is mainly associated to phospholipid-rich membrane areas, a location even enhanced upon IL-12 incubation of PHA blasts. Instead, IL-12Rbeta2 is found more segregated into membrane rafts, which could explain why two IL-12-triggered events, T-cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation, are both methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-sensitive events. Ligation of IL-12R with IL-12 seems to induce a partial enrichment of IL-12Rbeta2 in phospholipid-rich areas, where according to our data IL-12Rbeta1 is already present.

19061268,"Dietary supplementation with phytohemagglutinin in combination with alpha-ketoglutarate limits the excretion of nitrogen via urinary tract.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of both phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) alone, and in combination with alpha-ketoglutaric acid (AKG), on nitrogen elimination via the urinary tract as opposed to the gastrointestinal tract of rats. In experiment 1, rats were assigned to one of two experimental groups, (1) Control and (2) PHA, whilst in experiment 2, rats were assigned to one of three experimental groups, (1) Control, (2) AKG, and (3) AKG+PHA. AKG was administered via drinking water, while PHA was administered via a stomach tube. The stock solution of crude PHA in 0.9 % NaCl, was (20 % w/v) in water: 50 mg PHA/ml, 20 ml/kg body wt. Rats were 7 weeks old at the start of the experiments. Significantly lower daily weight gains in the AKG+PHA and PHA groups (p&lt;0.05) were observed compared to the Control and AKG groups. Increased duodenal crypt depth (138 % ; p&lt;0.05) was noticeable in the AKG+PHA group cf Controls; however, there was no significant difference in the thickness of the tunica mucosa. In the AKG+PHA group, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the granula of neuronal cells of the submucosal parasympathetic ganglia was noticeable, although no expression was found in goblet cells. Finally, significant reduction in N excretion in urine was observed in the AKG+PHA, compared with the Control groups (p&lt; 0.05). It is concluded that a combined PHA and AKG treatment stimulated the small bowel growth via enhanced epithelial turnover, reduced the N excreted in urine and increased the N in faeces.",M1
19055650,"Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are differentially associated with numbers of cytokine-producing cells and early atopy.BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seropositivity, at 2 years of age, was inversely related to IgE-sensitization and that this effect was enhanced when EBV is combined with cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. We hypothesize that early exposure to EBV or CMV will affect the cytokine balance in the individual. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to relate the cytokine profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the EBV and CMV serostatus and IgE-sensitization in children at 2 years of age. METHODS: Seventy-five children were followed prospectively from birth until 2 years of age. Their EBV and CMV serostatus was correlated to the numbers of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12-producing PBMC following <e>PHA</e> stimulation in vitro. Skin prick tests and allergen-specific IgE antibodies were used to assess IgE-sensitization. RESULTS: In the study cohort, there was an inverse association between EBV seropositivity and IgE-sensitization but not with CMV seropositivity. Following linear regression analysis, we did not detect any statistically significant associations between children with IgG antibodies against EBV at 2 years of age and the investigated cytokines. However, there was a non-significant tendency to a positive association between high numbers of all individual cytokine-producing cells and EBV seropositivity. Children who were CMV seropositive had significantly higher numbers of IFN-gamma and lower numbers of IL-4-producing cells compared with CMV negative children. There was a significant, positive association between the number of IL-4-producing cells and IgE-sensitization. CONCLUSION: Taken together our results indicate that infections with EBV and CMV in different ways will interact with the immune system and may protect children from developing early atopy.",M1
19042090,"Effect of phytohaemagglutinin-P on apoptosis and necrosis in Trichinella spiralis infected mice.Flow cytometry analyses were used to evaluate the contribution of apoptotic and necrotic lymphocytes in the selected organs of Trichinella spiralis infected mice treated with phytohaemagglutinin-P (<e>PHA</e>-P). The Tunnel method was used to examine apoptosis in a cryostat section from the jejunum and masseter muscle. CFW mice (Groups I and II) were infected with 200 larvae of T. spiralis. PHA-P was administered intravenously at a dose of 10mg/kg 24h prior to infection in Group II mice only. Group III mice were treated with PHA-P without T. spiralis infection, and Group IV mice were untreated controls. The lymphocytes obtained from the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and muscular inflammatory infiltration on 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 60 days post infection (DPI) were incubated with the Annexin-V-Fluos Staining Kit (Roche). The cryostat preparation made from the jejunum and masseter muscle was evaluated using a fluorescence microscope. PHA-P administration stimulated apoptosis in the jejunal mucosa and in the muscular inflammatory infiltration. In Group I mice, infected with T. spiralis only, the highest percentage of apoptotic cells was found on 7 DPI in the spleen and in MLN, and on 14 DPI among the cells of the muscular inflammatory infiltration. The peak of the necrotic lymphocytes was found on 7 DPI in the spleen, on 28 DPI in MLN, and on 21 DPI in the cells of muscular inflammatory infiltration. In Group II mice, infected with T. spiralis and treated with PHA-P, the peak in apoptotic cells occurred on 7 DPI in the spleen and in the muscular inflammatory infiltration. The highest level of necrotic lymphocytes was observed only on 7 DPI in the muscular inflammatory infiltration. Percentage of necrotic lymphocytes in the spleen was the same and in MLN it was lower than in Group I (T. spiralis only). Moreover, the number of muscle larvae in mice treated with PHA-P (Group II) was lower than in Group I (T. spiralis only).",M1
19035310,"Cytotoxicity of a series of ferrocene-containing beta-diketones.BACKGROUND: Oxidised ferrocenium compounds often possess antineoplastic activity. In contrast, reduced ferrocene derivatives frequently only show activity if cell components can oxidise them inside cells to the ferrocenium species. Ferrocene compounds having the lowest formal reduction potential are normally expected to be the most cytotoxic. Here we demonstrate this is not always the case. Some of the structure-related and physical properties that enhance ferrocenyl antineoplastic activity have been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ferrocene-containing beta-diketones of the type FcCOCH2COR with Fc=ferrocenyl and R=CF3, CCl3, CH3, Ph(=C6H5, phenyl) and Fc, were tested for cytotoxicity against HeLa (human cervix epitheloid), COR L23 (human large cell lung carcinoma) and platinum resistant CoLo320DM (human colorectal) and COR L23/CPR cancer cell lines. Cell survival was measured by means of the colorometric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: The mean drug concentration from 3 experiments causing 50% cell growth inhibition, (IC50) values, varied between 4.5 and 85.0 micromol dm(-3'), with the CF3(-) containing beta-diketone being the most active. Drug activity was inversely proportional to the formal reduction potential, Eo', of the ferrocenyl group, and dependent on the R group in the general beta-diketone structure. The CF3 complex was more cytotocic than cisplatin inter alia against platinum-resistant cell lines, and at least eight times more reactive against cancer cell lines than against <e>PHA</e> (phytohaemagglutinin)-stimulated lymphocyte cultures. CONCLUSION: A drug activity-structural relationship exists in that ferrocenyl drugs with halogen substituents chains are more cytotoxic. Compounds with higher ferrocenyl group formal reduction potential and stronger acid strength (i.e. smaller pKa value) are more cytotoxic.",M1
19027403,"Nutrient intake and immune function of elderly subjects.OBJECTIVE: Food intake, aging, and immune function share complex influences. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine relationships between nutrient intakes from food and dietary supplements and a biomarker of immune function. DESIGN: Data were collected from participants in a cross-sectional study as well as baseline data from a longitudinal study (n=89). Subjects completed 24-hour food recalls, including supplement intake. Polyclonal mitogen phytohemmagluttin (<e>PHA</e>) was the immune function stimulator used. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive, bivariate correlation, Spearman's rho for nonparametric data, t tests, and stepwise regression with nutrient intakes as independent variables and T-cell proliferation as dependent variables. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations (P&lt; or =0.05) were found between PHA-induced proliferation and intake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosahexaenoic acid (EPA), sodium, and selenium, although intakes of DHA plus EPA were inadequate when compared to recommended intakes. A significant negative correlation with total vitamin A, with many vitamin A levels being above the upper limit of safety. Regression analyses found these nutrients to be variables significant in explaining the variance in PHA (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Selenium, sodium, DHA, EPA, and vitamin A intake from diet and supplements were associated with PHA-induced proliferative responses. Clients may be counseled to have adequate selenium, EPA, DHA intake, and vitamin A, but avoid excess vitamin A.",M1
19025771,"Patterns of hippocampal neuronal loss and axon reorganization of the dentate gyrus in the mouse pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.The patterns of hippocampal neuronal loss and rewiring of the dentate gyrus (DG) were studied in the mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy at 2 months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE). NeuN immunocytochemistry showed two patterns of neuronal damage, i.e., type 1 with partial loss of pyramidal neurons in CA3 area and type 2 with almost compete loss of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>-L) demonstrated that, at different rostrocaudal segments of the hippocampus, associational and commissural connections in the DG changed differently between mice with type 1 vs. type 2 neuronal loss. Calretinin (CR)-immunopositive mossy cells in ventral hilus and its fibers in inner molecular layer of bilateral DG remained in mice with type 1 but almost disappeared in mice with type 2 neuronal loss, which was further supported by retrograde labeling with cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) showing colocalization of CTB with CR in the ventral hilus of bilateral DG in mice with type 1 neuronal loss, which was lost in those with type 2 neuronal loss. Furthermore, the sprouted PHA-L-immunopositive en passant and terminal boutons from the DG were found in CA1 area to contact with surviving calbindin-, CR-, and parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons. The present study therefore suggests that different patterns of neuronal loss in CA3 area may be linked to different axon reorganizations in the DG.",M1
19014336,"Bovine colostrum modulates cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and phytohemagglutinin.Bovine colostrum has been shown to influence the cytokine production of bovine leukocytes. However, it remains unknown whether processed bovine colostrum, a supplement popular among athletes to enhance immune function, is able to modulate cytokine secretion of human lymphocytes and monocytes. The aim of this investigation was to determine the influence of a commercially available bovine colostrum protein concentrate (CPC) to stimulate cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Blood was sampled from four healthy male endurance athletes who had abstained from exercise for 48 h. PBMCs were separated and cultured with bovine CPC concentrations of 0 (control), 1.25, 2.5, and 5% with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (3 microg/mL) and phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) (2.5 microg/mL). Cell supernatants were collected at 6 and 24 h of culture for the determination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-2 concentrations. Bovine CPC significantly stimulated the release of IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-2 (p &lt; 0.03). The addition of LPS to PBMCs cocultured with bovine CPC significantly stimulated the release of IL-2 and inhibited the early release of TNF, IL-6, and IL-4 (p &lt; 0.02). Phytohemagglutinin stimulation in combination with bovine CPC significantly increased the secretion of IL-10 and IL-2 at 6 h of culture and inhibited IFN-gamma and TNF (p &lt; 0.05). This data show that a commercial bovine CPC is able to modulate in vitro cytokine production of human PBMCs. Alterations in cytokine secretion may be a potential mechanism for reported benefits associated with supplementation.",M1
18973225,"Contralateral projections of the rat anterior olfactory nucleus.The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is a central olfactory cortical structure that has heavy reciprocal connections with both the olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex. While it has been firmly established that the AON is a primary source of bilateral projections in the olfactory system through extensive connections with both the ipsilateral and contralateral OB, AON, and piriform cortex, few studies have examined this circuitry in detail. In the present study we used small injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>-L) and the retrograde tracer FluoroGold in specific subregions of the AON to explore the topography of the interconnections between the left and right AONs. Labeled fibers were found in the contralateral AON following injections in all areas. However, detailed quantitative analyses revealed that different regions of the AON have distinct patterns of interhemispheric innervation; contralateral fibers were most heavily targeted to dorsal and lateral AON subregions, while the medial and ventral areas received relatively light projections. These results demonstrate important features of the interhemispheric circuitry of the AON and suggest separate functional roles for subregions of the AON in olfactory information processing.",M1
18952155,"Lectin panning method: the prospective isolation of mouse neural progenitor cells by the attachment of cell surface N-glycans to Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinating lectin-coated dishes.Retrospective isolation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) may cause deterioration of the phenotype during the long-term cultivation. Therefore, prospective isolation is essential for understanding the exact characteristics of intact NPCs in the brain. However, few suitable specific cell surface antigens on NPCs that could be used for their prospective isolation are available. The present study demonstrated that within 60 min after initial plating, embryonic day 12 (E12) brain cells firmly attach to several types of lectin-coated culture wells, including Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinating lectin (E-<e>PHA</e>), concanavalin A (Con A) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Approximately 80% of the cells isolated from E-PHA-coated wells expressed the nestin antigen, which is a specific intracellular marker for NPCs and the ratio of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive/nestin-positive cells to the cells attached on the E-PHA-coated wells was significantly higher than that of the cells attached on the wells coated with other adhesive substrates. The cells that were isolated from the E-PHA-coated wells continued to attach to the well for 1 week, while those isolated from Con A- and WGA-coated wells lost their attachment after 6 days and 1 day, respectively. Furthermore, the cells isolated from the E-PHA-coated wells grew quite satisfactorily and formed numerous attached neurospheres. Their growth rate was almost equal to that observed in suspension cultures. These results indicate that the lectin panning method enables the prospective, quick and easy isolation of mouse NPCs without requiring a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) system.",M1
18931171,"Circulating corticosterone reaction to restraint and adrenocorticotropin hormone administration in white leghorns selected for immune response traits.Corticosterone plasma concentration was measured in a random-bred control line and in 3 White Leghorn chicken lines previously selected over 9 generations for 3 different in vivo immune responses: high antibody response to Newcastle disease virus vaccine 3 wk after vaccination (ND3), high cell-mediated immune response (response to phytohemagglutinin, <e>PHA</e>), and high phagocytic activity measured as carbon clearance (CC). The objective of the study was to estimate if selection on immune response had an effect on the response to stress assessed by measures of corticosterone concentration before and after physical stress or adrenocorticotropin hormone injection and if the effect was dependent on the immune response trait that had been selected for, by joint analyses of immune responses and concentrations. The mean values of plasma corticosterone measures did not differ between lines, indicating that selection for different high immune responses had little effect on response to stress. Within line, however, significant negative correlations (-0.46 &lt;or= r &lt;or= -0.39) were found between cell-mediated immunity and corticosterone plasma concentrations in 3 of the 4 lines. Moreover, in the line selected for high antibody titers (ND3-L), corticosterone levels were positively correlated to ND3 (r = 0.41 and 0.47) and negatively correlated to CC (r = -0.48).",M1
18847473,"Differential gene expression profiles are dependent upon method of peripheral blood collection and RNA isolation.BACKGROUND: RNA isolation and purification steps greatly influence the results of gene expression profiling. There are two commercially available products for whole blood RNA collection, PAXgene and Tempus blood collection tubes, and each comes with their own RNA purification method. In both systems the blood is immediately lysed when collected into the tube and RNA stabilized using proprietary reagents. Both systems enable minimal blood handling procedures thus minimizing the risk of inducing changes in gene expression through blood handling or processing. Because the RNA purification steps could influence the total RNA pool, we examined the impact of RNA isolation, using the PAXgene or Tempus method, on gene expression profiles. RESULTS: Using microarrays as readout of RNA from stimulated whole blood we found a common set of expressed transcripts in RNA samples from either PAXgene or Tempus. However, we also found several to be uniquely expressed depending on the type of collection tube, suggesting that RNA purification methods impact results of differential gene expression profiling. Specifically, transcripts for several known <e>PHA</e>-inducible genes, including IFNgamma, IL13, IL2, IL3, and IL4 were found to be upregulated in stimulated vs. control samples when RNA was isolated using the ABI Tempus method, but not using the PAXgene method (p &lt; 0.01, FDR corrected). Sequenom Quantiative Gene Expression (QGE) (SanDiego, CA) measures confirmed IL2, IL4 and IFNgamma up-regulation in Tempus purified RNA from PHA stimulated cells while only IL2 was up-regulated using PAXgene purified (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Here, we demonstrate that peripheral blood RNA isolation methods can critically impact differential expression results, particularly in the clinical setting where fold-change differences are typically small and there is inherent variability within biological cohorts. A modified method based upon the Tempus system was found to provide high yield, good post-hybridization array quality, low variability in expression measures and was shown to produce differential expression results consistent with the predicted immunologic effects of PHA stimulation.",M1
18836906,"Effect of dietary supplementation with vitamins E and C on production performance, immune responses and antioxidant status of White Leghorn layers under tropical summer conditions.1. The effects of vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplementation on performance, some immune variables and antioxidant status of White Leghorn layers (aged 44-56 weeks) exposed to tropical summer conditions were investigated. 2. Both vitamins E and C significantly improved the egg production, food conversion efficiency, antibody responses to inoculated sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine, lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen and activities of antioxidant enzymes red blood cell catalase (RBCC) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in layers. Vitamin C increased the inflammatory response to phytohaemagglutinin-P (<e>PHA</e>-P) inoculation. 3. Supplemental vitamin C at 200 mg/kg diet significantly increased eggshell weight, eggshell thickness, and shell breaking strength. However, no effect of supplemental vitamin E on eggshell quality was observed. 4. Vitamins E and C, as well as interactions between them, significantly influenced the activities of glutathione reductase and lipid peroxidase. A combination of vitamin E at 125 IU/kg with vitamin C at 200 mg/kg diet had an additive effect on reducing the activity of oxidative enzyme lipid peroxidase (LP) and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzyme glutathione reductase (GSHR). 5. It is concluded that vitamin E (125 IU/kg) and vitamin C (200 mg/kg) could independently alleviate the effects of heat stress on production performance and immunological variables of layers. However, combination of both the vitamins at the above-mentioned concentrations is beneficial in eliciting higher antioxidant status in laying hens exposed to tropical summer conditions.",M1
18826514,"Mitogen-induced responses in lymphocytes from platypus, the Tasmanian devil and the eastern barred bandicoot.OBJECTIVE: As the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisi) and the eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunni) are currently at risk of serious population decline or extinction from fatal diseases in Tasmania, the goal of the present study was to describe the normal immune response of these species to challenge using the lymphocyte proliferation assay, to give a solid basis for further studies. METHODS: For this preliminary study, we performed lymphocyte proliferation assays on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the three species. We used the common mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), concanavalin A (ConA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). RESULTS: All three species recorded the highest stimulation index (SI) with the T-cell mitogens PHA and ConA. Tasmanian devils and bandicoots had greater responses than platypuses, although variability between individual animals was high. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we report the normal cellular response of the platypus, the Tasmanian devil and the eastern barred bandicoot to a range of commonly used mitogens.",M1
18820730,"The <e>PHA</e> test reflects acquired T-cell mediated immunocompetence in birds.BACKGROUND: cological immunology requires techniques to reliably measure immunocompetence in wild vertebrates. The PHA-skin test, involving subcutaneous injection of a mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA) and measurement of subsequent swelling as a surrogate of T-cell mediated immunocompetence, has been the test of choice due to its practicality and ease of use in the field. However, mechanisms involved in local immunological and inflammatory processes provoked by PHA are poorly known, and its use and interpretation as an acquired immune response is currently debated. METHODOLOGY: Here, we present experimental work using a variety of parrot species, to ascertain whether PHA exposure produces larger secondary than primary responses as expected if the test reflects acquired immunocompetence. Moreover, we simultaneously quantified T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4(+), CD5(+) and CD8(+)) and plasma proteins circulating in the bloodstream, potentially involved in the immunological and inflammatory processes, through flow cytometry and electrophoresis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our results showed stronger responses after a second PHA injection, independent of species, time elapsed and changes in body mass of birds between first and second injections, thus supporting the adaptive nature of this immune response. Furthermore, the concomitant changes in the plasma concentrations of T-lymphocyte subsets and globulins indicate a causal link between the activation of the T-cell mediated immune system and local tissue swelling. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings justify the widespread use of the PHA-skin test as a reliable evaluator of acquired T-cell mediated immunocompetence in diverse biological disciplines. Further experimental research should be aimed at evaluating the relative role of innate immunocompetence in wild conditions, where the access to dietary proteins varies more than in captivity, and to ascertain how PHA responses relate to particular host-parasite interactions.",M1
18773952,"Cholinergic innervation and thalamic input in rat nucleus accumbens.Cholinergic interneurons are the only known source of acetylcholine in the rat nucleus accumbens (nAcb); yet there is little anatomical data about their mode of innervation and the origin of their excitatory drive. We characterized the cholinergic and thalamic innervations of nAcb with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunocytochemistry and anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>-L) from the midline/intralaminar/paraventricular thalamic nuclei. The use of a monoclonal ChAT antiserum against whole rat ChAT protein allowed for an optimal visualization of the small dendritic branches and fine varicose axons of cholinergic interneurons. PHA-L-labeled thalamic afferents were heterogeneously distributed throughout the core and shell regions of nAcb, overlapping regionally with cholinergic somata and dendrites. At the ultrastructural level, several hundred single-section profiles of PHA-L and ChAT-labeled axon terminals were analyzed for morphology, synaptic frequency, and the nature of their synaptic targets. The cholinergic profiles were small and apposed to various neuronal elements, but rarely exhibited a synaptic membrane specialization (5% in single ultrathin sections). Stereological extrapolation indicated that less than 15% of these cholinergic varicosities were synaptic. The PHA-L-labeled profiles were comparatively large and often synaptic (37% in single ultrathin sections), making asymmetrical contacts primarily with dendritic spines (&gt;90%). Stereological extrapolation indicated that all PHA-L-labeled terminals were synaptic. In double-labeled material, some PHA-L-labeled terminals were directly apposed to ChAT-labeled somata or dendrites, but synapses were never seen between the two types of elements. These observations demonstrate that the cholinergic innervation of rat nAcb is largely asynaptic. They confirm that the afferents from midline/intralaminar/paraventricular thalamic nuclei to rat nAcb synapse mostly on dendritic spines, presumably of medium spiny neurons, and suggest that the excitatory drive of nAcb cholinergic interneurons from thalamus is indirect, either via substance P release from recurrent collaterals of medium spiny neurons and/or by extrasynaptic diffusion of glutamate.",M1
18717644,"In vivo delivery of bionanocapsules displaying Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin-L4 isolectin to malignant tumors overexpressing N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V.Metastasis is a key aspect of tumor malignancy, and several malignant tumors show expression of various mature N-type glycans. In particular, beta1-6 branching N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is abundantly expressed as a part of high-mannose glycans in various highly metastatic cancers. Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin-L(4) isolectin (L(4)-<e>PHA</e>), which adheres to beta1-6 GlcNAc specifically, has been used for in situ cancer diagnosis. Bionanocapsules (BNCs), hollow particles with a diameter of approximately 80 nm and composed of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and a lipid bilayer, have been developed as human liver-specific nanocapsules for in vivo drug delivery system. In this study, we have generated L(4)-PHA-displaying BNCs (PHA-BNCs) and examined whether L(4)-PHA could retarget the BNCs to malignant tumors as a  biosensor  distinguishing tumor metastaticity. Fluorescence-labeled PHA-BNCs injected systemically into a mouse xenograft model were found to accumulate in beta1-6 GlcNAc-expressing malignant tumors. The PHA-BNCs were able to deliver DNA to the malignant cancer cells. These results open up the possibility of using L(4)-PHA lectin as a targeting molecule in a drug delivery system, and of using PHA-BNCs as a novel nanodevice for malignant tumor-specific bioimaging and drug delivery.",M1
18701493,"Inhibition of the sodium/potassium ATPase impairs N-glycan expression and function.Aberrant N-linked glycans promote the malignant potential of cells by enhancing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the invasive phenotype. To identify small molecule inhibitors of N-glycan biosynthesis, we developed a chemical screen based on the ability of the tetravalent plant lectin L-phytohemagglutinin (L-<e>PHA</e>) to bind and crosslink surface glycoproteins with beta1,6GlcNAc-branched complex type N-glycans and thereby induce agglutination and cell death. In this screen, Jurkat cells were treated with a library of off-patent chemicals (n = 1,280) to identify molecules that blocked L-PHA-induced death. The most potent hit from this screen was the cardiac glycoside (CG) dihydroouabain. In secondary assays, a panel of CGs was tested for their effects on L-PHA-induced agglutination and cell death. All of the CGs tested inhibited L-PHA-induced death in Jurkat cells, and the most potent CG tested was digoxin with an EC(50) of 60 +/- 20 nmol/L. Digoxin also increased the fraction of some concanavalin A-binding N-glycans. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, digoxin specifically increased GlcNAc(1)Man(3)GlcNAc(2)Fuc(1) and GlcNAc(2)Man(3)GlcNAc(2)Fuc(1) oligosaccharides demonstrating an impairment of the N-glycan pathway. Consistent with this effect on the N-glycan pathway, digoxin inhibited N-glycosylation-mediated processes of tumor cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, digoxin prevented distant tumor formation in two mouse models of metastatic prostate cancer. Thus, taken together, our high throughput screen identified CGs as modifiers of the N-glycan pathway. These molecules can be used as tools to better understand the role of N-glycans in normal and malignant cells. Moreover, these results may partly explain the anticancer effect of CGs in cardiovascular patients.",M1
18690006,"Hypothermia augments NF-kappaB activity and the production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma.BACKGROUND: The differentiation of Th1 and Th2 is strictly regulated by humoral and cellular factors. The imbalance between Th1 and Th2 is considered to be the pathogenesis of allergic and autoimmune disorders. It is important to elucidate the effect of environmental factors, such as temperature, on the expression of cytokines of Th1 and Th2. METHODS: We investigated the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-12 from LPS- or <e>PHA</e>-stimulated PBMCs at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C using ELISA and Real-time PCR. We measured the change of NF-kappaB activity at 30 degrees C or 37 degrees C with LPS stimulation using the reporter gene assay. RESULTS: IFN-gamma production from LPS-stimulated PBMCs at 30 degrees C was up-regulated compared with 37 degrees C. IL-5 and IL-10 production from PHA-stimulated PBMCs at 30 degrees C were down-regulated compared with 37 degrees C. This augmented IFN-gamma production was caused by the up-regulation of IL-12 production from CD14+ blood monocytes. Both IL-12 mRNA and IL12 protein at 30 degrees C were up-regulated compared with 37 degrees C. NF-kappaB, the key molecule for the expression of IL-12, was also augmented at 30 degrees C compared with 37 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia up-regulated the expression of IL-12 and IFN-gamma due to the augmented NF-kappaB activity. It is suggested that hypothermia modifies the pattern of cytokine gene expression.",M1
18683180,"Influence of prenatal psychosocial stress on cytokine production in adult women.The aim of the present study was to determine the association between prenatal stress and immune function in human adults. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 34 healthy young women whose mothers experienced major negative life events during their pregnancy (Prenatal Stress, PS group, mean age 25, SD +/- 4.34 years), and from a female comparison group (n = 28, CG, mean age 24 +/- 3.40 years), were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>), and subsequent cytokine production was measured. A bias for T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production due to an overproduction of IL-4 relative to IFN-gamma after PHA stimulation was observed in PS subjects. In addition, IL-6 and IL-10 were also significantly elevated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest a direct association between prenatal stress exposure and alterations in immune parameters in adult women.",M1
18661377,"Effects of storage conditions of human whole blood on the viability of lymphocytes.PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal storage conditions of human whole blood to retain viability of lymphocytes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) stimulated and unstimulated human whole blood samples were stored for 48-96 h up to one week at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C and were analysed for apoptosis. After 96 h and one week of storage unstimulated cultures were stimulated to proliferate. These cultures and samples stimulated immediately before storing were incubated at 37 degrees C for 56 h and analysed for mitotic index (MI). RESULTS: Lymphocytes undergo apoptosis during storage and this loss of viability is accelerated by increasing both temperature and storage time. In the presence of PHA, incubation at both 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C for 48 h resulted in low percentages of apoptotic cells and after incubation at 4 degrees C for 96 h the cultures grown for 56 h at 37 degrees C revealed the highest percentage of MI.

Post-translational processing of mammalian tyrosinase is required for its folding, sorting, and for enzymatic activity. Here we show for the first time that the mammalian tyrosinase has beta1,6-branched N-glycan structure that can be recognized by binding with specific lectin Leukoagglutinating phytohematoagglutinin (L-<e>PHA</e>). Further, this specific glycoconjugate structure has been shown to have a function relationship in melanin synthesis.",M1

The present study investigated the dose range in which PHA provokes gut maturation and if it coincided with immune activation. Suckling rats, aged 14 d, were orogastrically fed a single increasing dose of PHA: 0 (control), 2, 10, 50 or 250 microg/g body weight (BW) in saline. The effect on gut, lymphoid organs and appearance of CD3+ (T-lymphocyte) and CD19+ (B-lymphocyte) cells in the small-intestinal mucosa was studied at 12 h (acute) and 3 d (late phase) after treatment. The low PHA doses (2 and 10 microg/g BW) induced intestinal hyperplasia without mucosal disarrangement but did not provoke gut maturation. Only the high PHA doses (50 and 250 microg/g BW) temporarily disturbed the intestinal mucosa with villi shortening and decrease in disaccharidase activities, and later after 3 d provoked precocious maturation, resulting in an increase in maltase and sucrase activities and decrease in lactase activity and disappearance of the fetal vacuolated enterocytes in the distal small intestine. Exposure to the high, but not to the low, PHA doses increased the number of mucosal CD19+ and CD3+ cells in the small intestine after 12 h, a finding also observed in untreated weaned rats aged 21-28 d. In conclusion, there was a dose-related effect of PHA on gastrointestinal growth and precocious maturation that coincided with a rapid expansion of mucosal B- and T-lymphocytes, indicating a possible involvement of the immune system in this process.",M1

The low capacity and high false positive rates of 2-DE gel-based lectin blots using phytohemagglutinin-L(4) (L-<e>PHA</e>) prompted us to develop a novel protocol for identifying GnT-V targets, in which serum proteins were subjected to immunodepletion, alkylation, and lectin precipitation using L-PHA coupled to avidin-agarose bead complexes, and tryptic digestion.

18596987,"Changes in phosphorylation of histone H2A.X and p53 in response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to gamma irradiation.The main aim of this study was to compare the reaction of quiescent and proliferating, i.e. phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-stimulated, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to gamma-radiation, and analyse changes of proteins related to repair of DNA damage and apoptosis, such as gammaH2A.X, p53, p53 phosphorylation at serines-15 and -392, and p21 and their dose dependence. Freshly isolated PBMCs in peripheral blood are predominantly quiescent, in G(0) phase, and with very low amounts of proteins p53 and p21. Using confocal microscopy we detected dose dependent (0.5-5 Gy) induction of foci containing gammaH2A.X (1 h after gamma-ray exposure), which are formed around radiation-induced double strand breaks of DNA. Apoptosis was detected from 24 h after irradiation by the dose of 4 Gy onwards by Annexin V binding and lamin B cleavage. Seventy two hours after irradiation 70% of CD3(+) lymphocytes were A(+). Neither increase in p53 nor its phosphorylation on serine-392 after irradiation was detected in these cells. However, massive increase in p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) was detected after irradiation, which can be responsible for late occurrence of apoptosis in these quiescent cells. PHA-stimulation itself (72 h) caused an increase in early apoptosis (A(+)PI(-)) in comparison to non-stimulated PBMCs (38% A(+) resp. 13.4%). After PHA-stimulation also the amount of gammaH2A.X, p53, and p21 increased, but no phosphorylation of p53 on serine-392 or -15 was detected. Reaction to gamma-radiation was different in PHA-stimulated lymphocytes: the p53 pathway was activated and p53 was phosphorylated on serines-15 and -392 4 h after irradiation by the dose of 4 Gy. Phosphorylation of p53 at serine-15 increased in a dose-dependent manner in the studied dose range 0.2-7.5 Gy. Also the amount of p21 increased after irradiation. Seventy two hours after irradiation of PHA-stimulated CD3(+) T lymphocytes by the dose of 4 Gy 65% of cells were A(+).",M1

The data demonstrated that seselin inhibited PBMC proliferation-activated with PHA with an IC(50) of 53.87+/-0.74 microM. Cell viability test indicated that inhibitory effects of seselin on PBMC proliferation were not through direct cytotoxicity. The action mechanisms of seselin may involve the regulation of cell cycle progression, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in PBMC. Since cell cycle analysis indicated that seselin arrested the cell cycle progression of activated PBMC from the G(1) transition to the S phase. Seselin suppressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma production in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, seselin significantly decreased the IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in PHA-activated PBMC. Therefore, results elucidated for the first time that seselin is likely an immunomodulatory agent for PBMC.",M1
18552305,"Cell-mediated immune activation rapidly decreases plasma carotenoids but does not affect oxidative stress in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa).In animals yellow-orange-red sexual traits pigmented by carotenoids have been suggested to act as signals of current health. Because carotenoids have important physiological functions, individuals might trade-off allocating these pigments to self-maintenance versus coloration. Carotenoids may act as scavengers of free radicals that are released during an immune response. Here, we experimentally assessed whether a local cell-mediated immune response affects circulating carotenoids, antioxidant status, oxidative damage and the expression of a carotenoid-based trait. Male red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) were subcutaneously injected with phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) or with phosphate buffer solution (controls). The effect of the treatment on circulating carotenoids, total plasma antioxidant status (TAS), lipid oxidative damage in erythrocytes (TBARS) and ornamentation was assessed. Immune challenge induced a 13% decrease in circulating carotenoids within 24 h. However, this treatment did not affect TAS, TBARS or coloration. Coloration, circulating carotenoids and cell-mediated immune response were positively correlated, but these were not related to TAS or TBARS. Carotenoids were only weakly related to TAS after controlling for the effect of uric acid levels. These results suggest that carotenoid-based ornaments may honestly indicate immunocompetence but probably not antioxidant capacity in this species, and that carotenoids might be relatively weak antioxidants in the plasma. Furthermore, even a relatively harmless and locally elicited immune challenge had important effects on circulating carotenoids, but this effect did not appear to be associated with oxidative stress. Alternative mechanisms linking carotenoids to immunity (not necessarily relying on the use of these pigments as antioxidants) should be considered in future studies on birds.",M1

The proposed cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) involvement, together with forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta are associated with regulatory T cell activity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the regulatory T cell-associated effect of ECP in recent onset type 1 diabetic (T1D) children. Children (n = 20) with T1D received photopheresis 8-methoxypsoralen + ECP or placebo + shampheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected pretreatment (day 1) and post-treatment (day 90) were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and T1D-associated glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD(65)) peptide a.a. 247-279. CTLA-4, sCTLA-4, FoxP3 and TGF-beta mRNA transcription was quantified. Photopheresis-treated individuals' relative mRNA expression was generally maintained during the course of the study. Placebo individuals increased in spontaneous CTLA-4 mRNA (P &lt; 0.05) but decreased in expression after stimulation with GAD(65)-peptide (P &lt; 0.05) and PHA (P &lt; 0.05). Spontaneous TGF-beta (P &lt; 0.05) increased whereas PHA- (P &lt; 0.01) and GAD(65)-peptide (P &lt; 0.01)-induced TGF-beta expression decreased in the placebo group, whereas it was maintained in the treated group. Without intervention, expression of CTLA-4 and TGF-beta, stimulated with PHA and GAD(65) peptide, decreased with time, with a parallel reduction of GAD(65)-peptide and PHA-stimulated TGF-beta expression. These parameters were counteracted by ECP. In conclusion, our results indicate that ECP maintains regulatory T cell-associated activity in recent-onset T1D.",M1
18523356,"Gastrin, secretin, GIP and VIP alter levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells under various culture conditions.BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal hormones have traditionally been viewed as mere regulators of gut movement and secretions, but, it is becoming increasingly apparent that other body systems may be affected by these hormones. Secretion of gut hormones is influenced by the type of food we take. Therefore, the more we know about the effects of gut hormones on the various body tissues, the more we know about the different mechanisms by which our diets affect our health. OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study aimed to explore the effects of physiologically-relevant concentrations of four gut hormones on the production of IL-2 and IFN- gamma by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and how culture conditions may modify those effects. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation from the blood of 15 adults. Cells were cultured with/without <e>PHA</e> and treated with four concentrations of gastrin, secretin, GIP and VIP. IL-2 and IFN- gamma in culture supernatants were assayed by ELISA. RESULTS: Gastrin, secretin, GIP and VIP increased IL-2 and IFN- gamma levels under some culture conditions and depressed IL-2 under other conditions. An increase was often observed under culture conditions in which the cytokine production was not initially high. Repeated administration of the hormone was also more likely to result in a stimulatory effect. CONCLUSIONS: Physiologically-relevant concentrations of gastrin, secretin, GIP and VIP are potential immunomodulators as they have shown their ability to alter the production of IL-2 and/or IFN- gamma under various culture conditions.",M1
18501882,"Negative regulation of IL-17 production by OX40/OX40L interaction.The T-cell cytokine IL-17 is implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases through its induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in a broad range of cell targets. Production of IL-17 defines the Th17 subset of helper T-cells associated with protection against microorganisms, a profile best characterized in the murine system. Multiple regulators of Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 production are reported, but the impact of OX40L is not described. OX40 ligand (OX40L) is an early-stage activator of T-cells through its interaction with CD134 (OX40) that is up-regulated on antigen challenged T-cells. Here, we show that OX40L suppresses IL-17 production by <e>PHA</e>-stimulated human PBMC and purified CD4 and CD8 cells. In agreement with prior reports, OX40L signaling through CD134 increased IFNgamma and IL-4, both of which are reported to inhibit the production of IL-17. OX40L suppression of IL-17 was completely reversed by a neutralizing IFNgamma antibody while there was no effect with a neutralizing IL-4 antibody. Moreover, OX40L also suppressed IL-17 in the presence of IL-23, an established inducer of IL-17 and differentiation factor for Th17 cells. Presuming mediation by IFNgamma, we evaluated expression of this cytokine in the presence of OX40L and IL-23. Surprisingly, IL-23 also induced IFNgamma by PHA-stimulated T-cells and this effect was enhanced in the presence of OX40L. Addition of the IFNgamma antibody not only reversed the OX40L suppression of IL-17 in the presence of IL-23, it markedly enhanced the level of IL-17. These results further establish IFNgamma as a primary modulator of IL-17 production in the human cells, much as in the murine system.",M1
18472047,"Time-dependent effects of ATP and its degradation products on inflammatory markers in human blood ex vivo.We recently reported that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) modulates cytokine release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>)-stimulated blood. ATP inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release via activation of the P2Y(11) receptor and increased interleukin (IL)-10 release via stimulation of the P2Y(12) receptor. Because ATP is known to be broken down by various ecto-enzymes, we determined the degradation profile of ATP in time in LPS-PHA-stimulated blood. ATP slowly metabolized with 14% remaining after 6h. Simultaneously, adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and hypoxanthine were formed. Subsequently, we investigated the time-dependent effects of ATP and its metabolites on inflammatory markers. Results showed that ATP decreased the rise in concentrations of TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-1beta, but increased concentrations of IL-8 and IL-10. Metabolites of ATP showed either no, similar or opposite effects on cytokine release, compared to ATP. In conclusion, ATP has rapid immunomodulatory effects on a variety of cytokines in stimulated whole blood that persist until 24h.",M1
18461481,"Changes in chromosome organization during <e>PHA</e>-activation of resting human lymphocytes measured by cryo-FISH.During interphase, chromosomes are arranged into territories within a highly organized nuclear space containing several compartments. It is becoming clear that this complex nuclear arrangement is important for gene regulation and therefore expression. The study of chromosome organization in interphase requires high-resolution imaging methods that at the same time allow for flexible labelling strategies and preserve nuclear structure. Tokuyasu cryosections of cells or tissues provide a simple, high-resolution platform for performing immunolabelling and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on well-preserved samples. Here we show how FISH performed on thin cryosections (cryo-FISH) can be used for the study of chromosome organization at high resolution and in a quantitative manner. We have measured chromosome intermingling, volume and radial position, in resting and activated human lymphocytes, and observed chromosome-specific differences between the two cellular states. These differences are in part related to the nuclear expansion that occurs during activation, but are also likely to be tied to their different transcriptional profiles. Extrapolation of our dataset to the whole genome suggests that activated cells contain a lower amount of chromatin involved in intermingling than resting cells.",M1
18459789,"Calcium ions make phytohemagglutinin resistant to trypsin proteolysis.To investigate the mechanism of phytohemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) susceptibility or resistance to the action of proteolytic enzymes, its in vitro proteolysis by trypsin was studied. It was found that Ca (2+) gives resistance to the native PHA molecule to trypsin proteolysis. In the absence of Ca (2+) trypsin performs a thorough hydrolysis of PHA. At the first stage of trypsin hydrolysis of PHA the formation of a relatively stable high molecular mass product occurs (PHA-T) as a result of non-co-operative proteolysis. At the second stage, the degradation of PHA-T occurs, and this degradation is performed by parallel co-operative proteolysis. This type of proteolysis differs from the action of trypsin on phaseolin, the main storage protein from common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The implications of Ca (2+)influence of PHA hydrolysis by trypsin are discussed.",M1
18441397,"Magnetic field anti-inflammatory effects in Crohn's disease depends upon viability and cytokine profile of the immune competent cells.AIM: We investigated effects of pulsating electromagnetic field (PEMF-50 Hz, 45 +/- 5 mT) on viability and cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and from Crohn's disease patients (CD). METHODS: The study was performed after activation of cells with phytohaemaglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) and lipopolisaccharide (LPS). Exposure of PBMC cultures to PEMF from both CD patients and from healthy donors decreased cell's viability of about 10% and 5% (p&gt;0.05) respectively. PEMF influence was most effective after threefold application. Susceptibility of PBMCs to magnetic field exposure differs among the stimulated (PHA, LPS) and not stimulated (NS) cells. Mitogen activated cells during cell division are most susceptible to induction of the cell death as a result of magnetic interaction, contrary PEMF exposure has minimal effect on non-diving PBMCs from CD patients and from controls. Decreased viability of the Crohn derived cells upon magnetic stimulation was accompanied by altered cytokines profile. Exposed and stimulated PBMCs from Crohn patients decreased IFN-gamma proinflammatory and increased IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The electromagnetically induced cell death could be an important step for non-invasive PEMF treatment in chronic inflammatory diseases.",M1

18408793,"The effects of sex and age on phytohaemagglutinin skin-testing of deer.AIM: To determine if there are sex- or age-related differences in the increase in skinfold thickness in response to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (<e>PHA</e>) in red deer. METHODS: One dose of 250 mug PHA was injected intradermally in the right side of the neck, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was injected at a second site as a control, in 110 (51 males and 59 females) captive Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus), ranging in age from 21 months to &gt; or =5 years. Skinfold thicknesses were measured immediately before and 72 h following injection. RESULTS: There was a significant effect of gender on the average increase in skinfold thickness; males had greater increases (8.8 (SEM 0.57) mm) than females (4.23 (SEM 0.39) mm) after correcting for other confounding variables. No age-related differences were evident, but differences between sexes were more marked with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Effects of gender, probably due to differences in energetic and reproductive constraints in red deer, should be taken into account when interpreting skinfold-test data, both in ecology and in the control of tuberculosis (Tb). Males tend to have a thicker skin than females, so skinfold increase relative to the thickness of the skin, rather than skinfold increase per se, should be used as a more appropriate measure of skinfold increase. This may also have clinical relevance in the interpretation of tuberculin skin testing.",M1
17123255,"Congenital Pelger-Huët anomaly in a horse.A 1.5-year-old male Arabian horse was referred to the Louisiana State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Clinic for an open deep laceration involving two thirds of the right trunk. The initial CBC results included an inflammatory leukogram, characterized by a marked degenerative left shift consisting of only immature band neutrophils (7500/microL, reference interval 0-100/microL) with toxic changes and no segmented neutrophils (0/microL, reference interval 2700-6700/microL). On abdominal ultrasonography, free abdominal fluid was found and collected for analysis. Abdominal fluid had a marked increase in total nucleated cells (40,600 cells/microL) consisting of 74% nondegenerate neutrophils that all were hyposegmented, with mature condensed chromatin. Re-evaluation of neutrophil morphology on the initial blood smear confirmed hyposegmentation and mature condensed chromatin, similar to that observed in cells in the abdominal fluid. A diagnosis of Pelger-Huët anomaly (<e>PHA</e>) was made in this colt. Congenital PHA was documented on the basis of persistent neutrophil hyposegmentation on serial blood smears, ruling out of acquired causes of PHA, and findings of similar neutrophil hyposegmentation on blood smears from the colt's sire and the sire's siblings. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of congenital PHA in a horse.",M2

Next to the hereditary irreversible form, acquired forms both reversible and irreversible have been described. We describe three transplant patients who were all investigated for a left shift in the absence of symptoms or signs of infection and in whom acquired reversible Pelger-Huët anomaly was discovered. The abnormal PMN phenotype was induced by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of the anomaly. In our three patients a dose-response effect was observed regarding plasma MMF concentration and severity of neutrophil dysplasia. Except for one slightly elevated value, the patients' plasma MMF levels were within the therapeutic range. None of the patients, one who was neutropenic at presentation and two who were non-neutropenic, developed infectious complications. From our three cases as well as those of other authors, we identify previous graft rejection episodes as a potential predisposing factor for the development of <e>PHA</e>. In the first patient, drug withdrawal led to normalization of PMN morphology. In the other two patients, the left shift disappeared after dose reduction. In these latter two patients, a form of desensitization to the effect of MMF on neutro- phils was observed following re-augmentation of MMF dose.",M2
12490533,"Mutations at the mouse ichthyosis locus are within the lamin B receptor gene: a single gene model for human Pelger-Huët anomaly.The nature of the wild-type gene product at the mouse ichthyosis (ic) locus has been of great interest because mutations at this locus cause marked abnormalities in nuclear heterochromatin, similar to those observed in Pelger-Huët anomaly (<e>PHA</e>). We recently found that human PHA is caused by mutations in the gene (LBR) encoding lamin B receptor, an evolutionarily conserved inner nuclear membrane protein involved in nuclear assembly and chromatin binding. Mice homozygous for deleterious alleles at the ichthyosis (ic) locus present with a blood phenotype similar to PHA, and develop other phenotypic abnormalities, including alopecia, variable expression of syndactyly and hydrocephalus. The ic locus on mouse chromosome 1 shares conserved synteny with the chromosomal location of the human LBR locus on human chromosome 1. In this study, we identified one nonsense (815ins) and two frameshift mutations (1088insCC and 1884insGGAA) within the Lbr gene of mice homozygous for either of three independent mutations (ic, ic(J) and ic(4J), respectively) at the ichthyosis locus. These allelic mutations are predicted to result in truncated or severely impaired LBR protein. Our studies of mice homozygous for the ic(J) mutation revealed a complete loss of LBR protein as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. The findings provide the molecular basis for the heterochromatin clumping and other distinct phenotypes caused by ic mutations. These spontaneous Lbr mutations confirm the molecular basis of human PHA and provide a small animal model for determination of the precise function of LBR in normal and pathological states.",M2

Affected individuals show hypolobulated neutrophil nuclei with coarse chromatin. Presumed homozygous individuals have ovoid neutrophil nuclei, as well as varying degrees of developmental delay, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities. Homozygous offspring in an extinct rabbit lineage showed severe chondrodystrophy, developmental anomalies and increased pre- and postnatal mortality. Here we show, by carrying out a genome-wide linkage scan, that PHA is linked to chromosome 1q41-43. We identified four splice-site, two frameshift and two nonsense mutations in LBR, encoding the lamin B receptor. The lamin B receptor (LBR), a member of the sterol reductase family, is evolutionarily conserved and integral to the inner nuclear membrane; it targets heterochromatin and lamins to the nuclear membrane. Lymphoblastoid cells from heterozygous individuals affected with PHA show reduced expression of the lamin B receptor, and cells homozygous with respect to PHA contain only trace amounts of it. We found that expression of the lamin B receptor affects neutrophil nuclear shape and chromatin distribution in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings have implications for understanding nuclear envelope-heterochromatin interactions, the pathogenesis of Pelger-like conditions in leukemia, infection and toxic drug reactions, and the evolution of neutrophil nuclear shape.",M2

The PHA and HE were described related to other hereditary and congenital conditions, but rarely have been found in the same individual. In this paper are reported discovery of the PHA and HE combined both in sister and brother, with global delay of development and peculiar physical characteristics. Blood smears of both showed an increase of bilobed neutrophils and elliptic erythrocytes. The family study showed two more members of the mother's branch affected with HE. The PHA could not be found in the parents, nor the other members of both branches. The early deaths or in uterus of three sibs of the propositus are appointed. The absence of the PHA in both parents of the affected individuals,--without discarding the illitimacy possibility--, can be explained by an incomplete genetic penetrance.

No abnormalities of the PHA cells, as compared to normal control cells, were found when tested for quantitative leukocyte enzyme activities, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, hexose monophosphate shunt activity, superoxide production, generation of chemiluminescence, or iodination. The PHA cells, as compared to normal PMNL, demonstrated normal chemotaxis and random migration, as well as bactericidal activity.",M2
