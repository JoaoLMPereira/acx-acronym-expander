20480704,"Dysfunctional belief domains related to obsessive-compulsive disorder: a further examination of their dimensionality and specificity.International consensus has been achieved on the existence of several dysfunctional beliefs underlying the development and/ or maintenance of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Nevertheless, questions such as the dimensionality of the belief domains and the existence of OCD-specific dysfunctional beliefs still remain inconclusive. The present paper addresses these topics through two different studies. Study 1: A series of confirmatory factor analyses (N = 573 non-clinical subjects) were carried out on the Obsessive Beliefs Spanish Inventory-Revised (OBSI-R), designed to assess dysfunctional beliefs hypothetically related to OCD. An eight-factor model emerged as the best factorial solution: responsibility, over-importance of thoughts, thought-action fusion-likelihood, thought action fusion-morality, importance of thought control, overestimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty and perfectionism. Study 2: The OBSI-R and other symptom measures were administered to 75 OCD patients, 22 depressed patients, and 25 non-OCD anxious patients. Results indicated that, although OCD patients differed from their non-clinical counterparts on all of the OBSI-R subscales, no evidence of OCD-specificity emerged for any of the belief domains measured, as the OCD subjects did not differ from the other two clinical groups of patients.",M1
20437583,"Cerebellar morphology in Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVE: Neuroanatomical and functional imaging studies have identified the cerebellum as an integral component of motor and language control. Few studies, however, have investigated the role of the cerebellum in Tourette syndrome (TS), a condition defined by the presence of semi-involuntary movements and sounds. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 163 persons with TS and 147 control participants. Multivariate linear regression models were used to explore effects on cerebellar surface morphology and underlying volumes for the main diagnosis effects of TS as well as comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, the correlations of symptom severity with cerebellar morphology were also assessed. RESULTS: The TS group demonstrated reduced volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally that derived primarily from reduced gray matter in crus I and lobules VI, VIIB, and VIIIA. These decreased regional volumes accompanied increasing tic symptom severity and motoric disinhibition as demonstrated by a finger tapping test. Males had reduced volumes of these same regions compared with females, irrespective of diagnosis. Comorbid OCD was associated with relative enlargement of these regions in proportion to the increasing severity of OCD symptoms. INTERPRETATION: The cerebellum is involved in the pathogenesis of TS and tic-related OCD. Baseline gender differences in cerebellar morphology may in part account for the more prevalent expression of TS in males.",M1

20418887,"Slitrk5 deficiency impairs corticostriatal circuitry and leads to obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in mice.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a common psychiatric disorder defined by the presence of obsessive thoughts and repetitive compulsive actions, and it often encompasses anxiety and depressive symptoms. Recently, the corticostriatal circuitry has been implicated in the pathogenesis of OCD. However, the etiology, pathophysiology and molecular basis of OCD remain unknown. Several studies indicate that the pathogenesis of OCD has a genetic component. Here we demonstrate that loss of a neuron-specific transmembrane protein, SLIT and NTRK-like protein-5 (Slitrk5), leads to OCD-like behaviors in mice, which manifests as excessive self-grooming and increased anxiety-like behaviors, and is alleviated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Slitrk5(-/-) mice show selective overactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex, abnormalities in striatal anatomy and cell morphology and alterations in glutamate receptor composition, which contribute to deficient corticostriatal neurotransmission. Thus, our studies identify Slitrk5 as an essential molecule at corticostriatal synapses and provide a new mouse model of OCD-like behaviors.",M1
20414874,"[The neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder: new findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging (I)]INTRODUCTION: In recent years, neuroscience has shown a growing interest in applying its methods to furthering the knowledge of psychiatric disorders, and one of the fundamental tools used to do so are neuroimaging techniques. Yet, in general, few studies have been conducted in which functional magnetic resonance has been applied in this field and findings are sometimes contradictory. AIMS: In this first part of our work we review the specialised bibliography and present a critical discussion on the scientific literature published to date on neuroimaging and neuropsychology of one of the most widely studied disorders from a neurobiological point of view, namely, obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). DEVELOPMENT: The article outlines the basic aspects of neurobiological research into OCD, which has focused more especially on studying the cortico-striato-thalamic system. Results of this research suggest the existence of a deficit in the response inhibition as the possible cognitive substrate underlying the symptoms of OCD. In the second part, we will review the papers dealing with the use of this neuroimaging technique that have been indexed in the most commonly used medical databases on the topic since 1996. CONCLUSIONS: Response inhibition seems to be an important cognitive domain when it comes to explaining this disorder. Most studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex (orbitofrontal and cingulate), the basal ganglia and the thalamus are related with the pathogenesis of OCD.",M1
20414175,"Clinical features and treatment characteristics of compulsive hoarding in Japanese patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.INTRODUCTION: Compulsive hoarding has been studied primarily in Western countries. Here we sought to examine compulsive hoarding in Japanese patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). The heterogeneous nature of hoarding was also investigated. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-eight OCD outpatients were initially assessed to determine the presence or absence of compulsive hoarding, and whether hoarding was primary or secondary to another symptom dimension for which they had received treatment for 1 year. RESULTS: Of the participants, 54 patients were found to have compulsive hoarding. Hoarders were significantly more likely than non-hoarding patients to have more severe psychopathology including elevated severity of OCD symptoms, poorer insight, higher prevalence of comorbid schizotypal or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, closer association with symmetry dimension, and poorer treatment outcome. Comparisons of subjects with primary and secondary hoarding found that the former group had more severe clinical features, while the latter group hoarded a wider variety of items, including apparently bizarre ones. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and clinical characteristics of compulsive hoarding in OCD subjects was similar to those reported in Western countries, supporting its trans-cultural consistency. The distinction between primary and secondary hoarding in OCD is clinically useful, and may contribute to the debate about whether hoarding should be a separate diagnostic entity.",M1
20405764,"When exposures go wrong: troubleshooting guidelines for managing difficult scenarios that arise in exposure-based treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder.Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and ritual prevention (ERP) is widely accepted as the most effective psychological treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). However, the extant literature and treatment manuals cannot fully address all the variations in client presentation, the diversity of ERP tasks, and how to negotiate the inevitable therapeutic challenges that may occur. Within this article, we attempt to address common difficulties encountered by therapists employing exposure-based therapy in areas related to: 1) when clients fail to habituate to their anxiety, 2) when clients misjudge how much anxiety an exposure will actually cause, 3) when incidental exposures happen in session, 4) when mental or covert rituals interfere with treatment, and 5) when clients demonstrate exceptionally high sensitivities to anxiety. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between treatment theory and practical implementation issues encountered by therapists providing CBT for OCD.",M1
20402454,"The Brazilian Portuguese version of the Saving Inventory-Revised: internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity of a questionnaire to assess hoarding.Pathological hoarding results in clutter that precludes normal activities and creates distress or dysfunction. It may lead to an inability to complete household functions, health problems, social withdrawal, and even death. The aim of this study was to describe the validation of the Brazilian version of the hoarding assessment instrument, the Saving Inventory-Revised. Sixty-five patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and 70 individuals from the community were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV (clinical sample), the Saving Inventory-Revised, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The Brazilian version of the Saving Inventory-Revised exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .94 for OCD and .84 for controls), high to moderate test-retest reliability and, using the hoarding dimension of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised as a reference point, high to moderate convergent validity. The Saving Inventory-Revised total scores also correlated significantly with comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.",M1
20399341,"A case-control study of sex differences in strategic processing and episodic memory in obsessive-compulsive disorder.Although clinical and genetic data for obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) support the hypothesis of sexual dimorphism, the neuropsychological findings remain inconclusive. The aim of our study was to determine whether there are differences in cognitive performance between men and women with OCD as compared with healthy controls (HCs). A neuropsychological battery was administered to 50 patients with OCD (31 men and 19 women) and 50 HCs matched by sex, age, and educational level with patients. We evaluated intelligence, attention, episodic memory, and use of organizational strategies during encoding of verbal and nonverbal information. Male patients scored worse than controls did in measures of nonverbal memory tasks, whereas the cognitive performance of women with OCD was consistent with that of their HC counterparts. These results suggest a distinct pattern of cognitive dysfunction specific to the patients' sex.",M1
20399339,"Impact of obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity on the sociodemographic and clinical features of patients with bipolar disorder.BACKGROUND: In this study, our aim is to determine the prevalence rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) comorbidity and to assess the impact of OCD comorbidity on the sociodemographic and clinical features of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). METHODS: Using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist and Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-IV/Clinical Version on bipolar patients, 2 groups, BD with OCD comorbidity (BD-OCD) and BD without OCD comorbidity, were formed. These groups were compared for sociodemographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: Of 214 patients with BD, 21.9% of them had obsession and/or compulsion symptoms and 16.3% had symptoms at the OCD level. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the frequency of comorbid OCD in BD-I (22/185, 11.9%) and BD-II (3/13, 23.1%) patients, but OCD was found to be significantly high in BD not otherwise specified (10/16, %62.5) patients than BD-I (P &lt; .001) and BD-II (P = .03). Six patients (17.1%) of the BD-OCD group had chronic course (the presence of at least 1 mood disorder episode with a duration of longer than 2 years), whereas the BD without OCD group had none, which was statistically significant. There were no statistically significant differences between BD-OCD and BD without OCD groups in terms of age, sex, education, marital status, polarity, age of BD onset, presence of psychotic symptoms, presence of rapid cycling, history of suicide attempts, first episode type, and predominant episode type. LIMITATIONS: Main limitation of our study was the assessment of some variables based on retrospective recall. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the high comorbidity rates for OCD in BD patients. Future studies that examine the relationship between OCD and BD using a longitudinal design may be helpful in improving our understanding of the mechanism of this association.",M1
20394177,"Adequacy of pharmacotherapy among medicaid-enrolled patients newly diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVE: To determine the adequacy of pharmacotherapy received by patients with newly-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), based on current practice guidelines. METHODS: A 9 year (1997-2006) retrospective claims analysis of adults enrolled in Florida Medicaid for at least 3 continuous years was conducted to determine the percentage who received both a minimally effective duration (&gt; 8 continuous weeks) and dose of first-line OCD pharmacotherapy during the year following their first ( index ) OCD diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 2,960,421 adult (&gt; 18 years of age) enrollees, 2,921 (0.1%) were diagnosed with OCD. Among the 2,825 OCD patients without comorbid Asperger syndrome or autism, 843 had newly-diagnosed OCD and at least 12 months of follow-up data after their index diagnosis. Among these 843 patients, 588 (69.7%) received first-line OCD pharmacotherapy but only 323 (38.3%) received a minimally effective pharmacotherapy trial in the year following their index diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Among clinically-diagnosed persons with OCD (&lt;10% of those with the disorder), a minority of newly-diagnosed patients receive a minimally effective pharmacotherapy trial consistent with current standards of care. Reasons such as limited patient adherence and/or physician awareness of guidelines must be identified and redressed to ameliorate the patient, healthcare system, and economic burdens associated with OCD.",M1
20390817,"An open trial of intensive family based cognitive-behavioral therapy in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder who are medication partial responders or nonresponders.This study reports an open-trial of family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Thirty primarily Caucasian youth with OCD (range = 7-19 years; 15 girls) who were partial responders or nonresponders to two or more medication trials that were delivered either serially or concomitantly received 14 sessions of intensive family-based CBT. Eighty percent of participants were considered improved at posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up, and symptom severity was reduced by 54% at both posttreatment and follow-up. Seventeen (56.6%) and 16 (53.3%) participants were classified as being in remission at posttreatment and follow-up, respectively. Significant reductions in OCD-related impairment, depressive symptoms, behavioral problems, and family accommodation were noted. No significant difference in youth-reported anxiety was found.",M1
20389131,"Relationship of possible stress-related biochemical markers to oxidative/antioxidative status in obsessive-compulsive disorder.Free radicals have been found to play an important role in obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). So, we measured the oxidative/antioxidative status of OCD patients, and assessed its use as a biological marker. The study was carried out on 20 healthy and 20 OCD subjects, aged between 20 and 40 years. Biochemical parameters of all subjects were assessed and compared. A significant difference in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels was observed between the OCD and control groups (p &lt; 0.05); malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also significantly higher in OCD subjects (p &lt; 0.05). Our study found an overall oxidative imbalance in OCD, leaning towards the antioxidant side in sufferers (specifically towards SOD). SOD has a protective role in overcoming oxidative stress; therefore, oxidative stress could have a pathophysiological role in OCD. Therapy specifically targeting MDA production will have a beneficial effect in overcoming the oxidative stress, anxiety and affective disorder which may be associated with OCD.",M1
20356551,"[Experimental study on sensory gating in generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders]OBJECTIVE: To observe the characteristics of sensory gating P50 in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and in obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) patients. METHODS: Auditory evoked potentials P50 were recorded in 41 GAD patients, 69 OCD patients and in 58 normal controls by the conditioning/testing paradigm presented with auditory double clicks stimuli, using American Nicolet Bravo instrument. RESULTS: (1) No significant differences was found in latencies of S1-P50 and S2-P50 among these three groups (P &gt; 0.05). (2) Significant differences were found in indices of S1-P50 amplitudes (NC: 6 +/- 3, GAD: 3 +/- 2, OCD: 5 +/- 3, P &lt; 0.01), S2-P50 amplitudes (NC: 2 +/- 1, GAD: 4 +/- 1, OCD: 2 +/- 1, P &lt; 0.01), S2/S1, S1-S2 and 100(1-S2/S1). (3) Compared with NC, GAD and OCD patients showed a decreased S1-P50 amplitude and OCD patients also showed an increased S2-P50 amplitude. (4) P50 inhibition significantly decreased in GAD and OCD patients. The values of S2/S1 ratio were 39% +/- 22% in NC, 50% +/- 29% in GAD and 88% +/- 42% in OCD (P &lt; 0.01). (5) Both S1-S2 and 100 (1-S2/S1) decreased in GAD and OCD patients (NC: 3 +/- 2, 61 +/- 22; OCD: 1 +/- 1, 15 +/- 22; GAD: 3 +/- 3, 50 +/- 29. P &lt; 0.01). (6) Compared with GAD, OCD patients showed a lower S2/S1 ratio (P &lt; 0.01) and a higher value of S1-S2 (P &lt; 0.01) and 100 (1-S2/S1) (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The anxiety disorder patients has sensory gating deficits. The inhibition deficit can be measured by auditory evoked potential P50. And S2/S1 ratio, S1-S2 and 100(1-S2/S1) may be biological markers of GAD and OCD patients.",M1
20302914,"Functional connectivity in fronto-subcortical circuitry during the resting state in obsessive-compulsive disorder.Obsessions and compulsions mediated by cognitive inflexibility might be associated with abnormal resting state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) that represents intrinsically generated neuronal activity. It was hypothesized that decreased functional connectivity in the DMN would occur in components of fronto-subcortical circuits in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Twenty-two unmedicated OCD patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls received resting state functional scanning runs. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) region was chosen as the seed region for the connectivity analysis. Correlations between temporal connectivity with the seed region and scores on clinical measures and obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were also assessed. OCD patients demonstrated less functional connectivity within the DMN in the anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and putamen compared to controls. The functional connectivity to the PCC seed region in OCD patients was in the direction opposite to that in the prefrontal areas with regard to scores on cleaning and obsessions/checking dimensions of OCD. These data provide evidence for fronto-subcortical dysfunction in OCD. Results from this study also support the notion that OCD is a heterogeneous disorder mediated by distinct circuits.",M1
20213231,"Genetics of early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. Epidemiological data are similar in children and adults, i.e., between 1 and 3% of the general population suffer from OCD. Children with OCD are often seriously impaired in their development. OCD, especially of early onset, has been shown to be familial. Several candidate genes of predominantly neurotransmitter systems have been analyzed and a total of three genome-wide linkage scans have been performed until now. Analyses of candidate genes in linkage regions have not provided evidence for their involvement in OCD, with the exception of the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 on 9p24. Genome-wide association analyses are in progress and the results will promote further independent replication studies. The consideration of subtypes regarding age of onset, symptom dimensions and/or comorbid disorders is needed.",M1
20183673,"Parent-child agreement in the assessment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.The purpose of the current study was to extend research regarding parent-child agreement in the assessment of anxiety disorders to include youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Ninety-three children and adolescents with OCD (50 female, 43 male), ages 6 to 17 years, and their parents were administered the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children. Data were obtained from a review of records of children and their parents seeking services from a university-based research and treatment clinic. Consistent with previous research on the assessment of anxiety disorders in youth, results indicated that parent-child agreement in the assessment of OCD is relatively poor at both the diagnostic and symptom levels. Our findings highlight the importance of multiple informant diagnostic systems in assessing childhood OCD.",M1
20182547,"High-dose glycine treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder in a 5-year period.This paper describes an individual who was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) at age 17 when education was discontinued. By age 19, he was housebound without social contacts except for parents. Adequate trials of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, two with atypical neuroleptics, were ineffective. Major exacerbations following ear infections involving Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus at ages 19 and 20 led to intravenous immune globulin therapy, which was also ineffective. At age 22, another severe exacerbation followed antibiotic treatment for H. pylori. This led to a hypothesis that postulates deficient signal transduction by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Treatment with glycine, an NMDAR coagonist, over 5 years led to robust reduction of OCD/BDD signs and symptoms except for partial relapses during treatment cessation. Education and social life were resumed and evidence suggests improved cognition. Our findings motivate further study of glycine treatment of OCD and BDD.",M1
20171333,"Development and validation of a child version of the obsessive compulsive inventory.Surprisingly, only 3 self-report measures that directly assess pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) have been developed. In addition, these scales have typically been developed in small samples and fail to provide a quick assessment of symptoms across multiple domains. Therefore, the current paper presents initial psychometric data for a quick assessment of pediatric OCD across multiple symptom domains, a child version of the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (the OCI-CV). Data from a sample of over 100 youth ages 7 to 17 with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD support the use of the 21-item OCI-CV. Results support the use of the OCI-CV as a general index of OCD symptom severity and in 6 symptom domains parallel to those assessed by the revised adult version of the scale (OCI-R). The OCI-CV showed strong retest reliability after approximately 1.5 weeks in a subsample of 64 participants and was significantly correlated with clinician-rated OCD symptom severity and parent and child reports of dysfunction related to OCD. Significantly stronger correlations with self-reported anxiety than with depressive symptoms provide initial support for the divergent validity of the measure. Finally, preliminary data with 88 treatment completers suggest that the OCI-CV is sensitive to change.",M1
20171325,"Development of a patient adherence scale for exposure and response prevention therapy.Exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) is an evidence-based treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). For EX/RP to be maximally effective, it is believed that patients must adhere outside of sessions to the procedures they learn in therapy. To date, there is no standard measure of patient EX/RP adherence, despite the importance of accurately assessing EX/RP adherence in both clinical research and practice. This paper describes the development of the Patient EX/RP Adherence Scale (PEAS), which assesses the patient's between-session adherence to the therapist's EX/RP instructions, and presents initial data on the scale's reliability and validity. The scale was designed to focus on the key procedures of EX/RP and to be brief enough to be used at each treatment session. The scale demonstrates excellent interrater reliability and good face and content validity. The usefulness of the scale is considered in the context of being an important tool to researchers trying to understand and improve outcomes of EX/RP for OCD as well as to EX/RP therapists in clinical practice. Future research will need to test the scale's reliability and validity in a larger sample of patients over the course of treatment.",M1
20166795,"Predictors of placebo response in randomized controlled trials of psychotropic drugs for children and adolescents with internalizing disorders.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess predictors of placebo response in all available short-term, placebo-controlled trials of psychotropic drugs for children and adolescents with internalizing disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>,) and anxiety disorders (ANX) exclusive of OCD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: We reviewed the literature relevant to the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents with internalizing disorders, restricting our review to double-blind studies including a placebo arm. Placebo response, defined according to each trial's primary response outcome variable and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, when available, and potential predictive variables were extracted from 40 studies. RESULTS: From 1972 to 2007, we found 23 trials that evaluated the efficacy of psychotropic medication involving youth with MDD, 7 pertaining to youths with OCD, and 10 pertaining to youths with ANX (N = 2,533 patients in placebo arms). For all internalizing disorders combined, predictors of nonresponse to placebo were the percentage of Caucasian patients included in the study and the duration of the disorder: Both variables were negatively correlated with the percent of placebo responders. The type of disorder was found to predict the robustness of placebo response: (OCD &lt; ANX &lt; MDD). For a subset of MDD studies, we found that baseline illness severity tended to be negatively correlated with placebo response. Finally, trial  success  was significantly associated with lower placebo response rate. CONCLUSION: Predictors of placebo response in internalizing disorders of youths parallel those in adult studies, with the exception of race. These predictors should be considered when designing placebo-controlled trials in youths to enhance findings of true drug-placebo differences.",M1
20163876,"Comorbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: Does it imply a specific subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder?The present study examined whether the comorbidity of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) constitute a specific subtype of OCD. The study sample consisted of 146 consecutive outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD. Diagnoses were established using MINI, IPDE, YBOCS and YBOCS-SC. OCD patients with comorbid OCPD were compared with OCD patients without OCPD on various sociodemographic and clinical variables. Almost one third of the OCD subjects met criteria for comorbid OCPD. OCD+OCPD patients had a significantly earlier age at onset of initial OC symptoms, earlier age at onset of OCD and more obsessions and compulsions than pure obsessions compared to the patients with OCDOCPD. OCD+OCPD patients also had a higher rate of comorbidity with avoidant personality disorder and showed more impairment in global functioning. There were not differences between the two sub-groups on severity of OCD symptoms and also on type of OCD onset. Our results indicate that the comorbidity of OCD with OCPD is associated with a number of specific clinical characteristics of OCD. These findings in conjunction with of current clinical, family and genetic studies provide some initial evidence that OCD comorbid with OCPD constitute a specific subtype of OCD.",M1
20159197,"[Washing, checking, and rumination: are the belief domains, obsessions and compulsions specific to <e>OCD</e> subtypes?]AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present study is to explore the validity of the Padua inventory and two belief questionnaires: the obsessive beliefs questionnaire (OBQ) and the interpretation of intrusions inventory (III). BACKGROUND: The Padua inventory is a 60-item self-report measurement of obsessive compulsive symptoms that measures both classic compulsive checking and cleaning behaviour as well as various types of obsessions, including impulses. Studies in several countries have provided support for the reliability and validity of the Padua inventory, including Italy, the Netherlands, North America, and the UK. The obsessive beliefs questionnaire assesses belief domains related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): inflated responsibility, importance of thoughts, control of thoughts, overestimation of threat, perfectionism, and intolerance of uncertainty. It consists of 87 items representing dysfunctional assumptions covering these six domains. The interpretation of intrusions inventory consists of 31 items that refer to interpretations of intrusions that have occurred recently. Three of the above domains are represented: importance of thoughts, control of thoughts and responsibility. Data from clinical or non-clinical samples are used to study the factor structure, reliability, and convergent and divergent validity of these two questionnaires. METHODOLOGY: The three questionnaires were administrated to two groups of people as follows: 96 patients with OCD and 53 non-clinical subjects. The patients were selected from Rhone Alpes clinics and hospitals using DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis, prior to treatment. Diagnosis was based on semi-structured interview (MINI) and clinical interview by a trained psychiatrist using DSM-IV criteria. The second aim of the study was to investigate generality and congruence criterion of the subscales of the Padua inventory and beliefs domains in OCD symptom subtypes (rumination, washing, checking). The present study investigates whether specific OCD symptom subtypes are associated with specific symptom subscales and belief domains in an OCD sample. The criteria for categorizing a participant into an OCD symptom subtype was a score greater or equal to 75% of one main ritual. Fifty participants (52%) met these criteria: washing (n=20), rumination (n=16), checking (n=8), hoarding (n=1), perfectionism (n=3), and repeating (n=2). The other 46 subjects formed a non-specific symptom subtype (two or more rituals). Participants in the precision (perfectionism), the hoarding, and repeating symptom subtypes were excluded because of a small sample. RESULTS: The Padua inventory and the two questionnaires OBQ and III discriminated between French OCD and non clinical controls. In the OCD sample, the three subtypes (washers, rumination and checkers) did not differ from each other on total YBOCS score and total Padua score. The  washer  subjects scored higher than both  checker  subjects and subjects with rumination on the washing scale of the Padua inventory. The  checker  subjects scored higher than the two other subtypes on the checking scale. The impaired mental control and urges and worries of losing control scales failed to discriminate between the subjects with rumination and the two other (checking and washing) subtypes. The OBQ total and the six subscale scores failed to discriminate between the three OCD subtypes. These results were replicated with the III. The ANOVAs revealed that the participants in the rumination symptom subtype scored higher only on the importance/control of thoughts of the OBQ-44 than the participants in the checking subtype. Implications for future research are discussed.",M1
20152064,"The impact of symptomatic hoarding in <e>OCD</e> and its treatment.BACKGROUND: The value of defining subtypes in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has become an important issue for recent debate. Probably the most robust example of subtyping is the identification of hoarding as being different both in terms of psychopathology and response to treatment. AIMS: To identify differences in psychopathology and treatment response in OCD patients with and without additional hoarding symptoms. METHOD: Patients who had undertaken CBT for OCD were selected as falling into either a high or a low hoarding group. The high hoarding group (n = 18) was selected on the basis of a high score on the hoarding subscale of a self-report measure of OCD symptoms in addition to reaching clinician judged  threshold  on the hoarding item of the Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) SCID-II module. The low hoarding group (n = 20) was selected on the basis of a low score on the hoarding subscale and a clinician judgement that the hoarding item of the OCPD SCID-II module was  absent . RESULTS: On some measures of pre-treatment psychopathology, patients with OCD with hoarding symptoms were more severely affected than those without hoarding symptoms. It was found that there was no difference in eventual treatment outcome between the two groups, although there was some evidence that the hoarding group showed greater symptom decreases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of hoarding symptoms does not negatively impact on the treatment of OCD.",M1
20143498,"Minority participation in randomized controlled trials for obsessive-compulsive  disorder.This paper reviews published randomized trials in North America to determine whether minority groups are underrepresented in clinical trials of <e>OCD</e>. A search of the literature produced 40 randomized trials of both adults and children with OCD, conducted in the U.S. and Canada from 1989 to 2009 (N = 3777). The groups included in this review were Caucasians/European Americans, Black/African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino-Americans, Asian-Americans, Others, and Unknown. Of these, 22 of 40 trials reported ethnic/racial information or data was available by request. We focused on the 21 trials from 1995 to 2008 providing ethnic/racial information, and among those (N = 2221), 91.5% of participants were Caucasian, 1.3% were African-American, 1.0% were Hispanic, 1.6% were Asian, 1.5% were Other, and 3.1% were Unknown. We conclude that minorities are underrepresented in North American OCD trials. Therefore, it is not known if empirically validated treatments are effective for these groups. Recommendations for improving recruitment of minorities for future studies are discussed.",M1
20136383,"Role of dopamine in the pathophysiology and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.The differential effects of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors on obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) were sufficient to presume that a serotonin regulatory disorder is the most essential part of the pathophysiology of OCD. In patients with OCD, however, a high-dose of serotonin-reuptake inhibitor monotherapy may not be sufficient, and approximately half of patients were noted to be treatment-resistant. As results from previous studies have shown, there have been positive treatment responses to the dopaminergic antagonists. This suggests that other neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine, are involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. Preclinical, neuroimaging and neurochemical studies have provided evidence demonstrating that the dopaminergic system is involved in inducing or aggravating the symptoms that are indicative of OCD. In this article, we review the dopaminergic system in OCD pathophysiology as well as reviewing the effect of drugs that act on dopaminergic activity in OCD.",M1
20116047,"Deep brain stimulation for intractable obsessive compulsive disorder: pilot study using a blinded, staggered-onset design.BACKGROUND: Prior promising results have been reported with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior limb of the internal capsule in cases with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) who had exhausted conventional therapies. METHODS: In this pilot study, six adult patients (2 male; 4 female) meeting stringent criteria for severe (minimum Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS] of 28) and treatment-refractory OCD had DBS electrode arrays placed bilaterally in an area spanning the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum referred to as the ventral capsule/ventral striatum. Using a randomized, staggered-onset design, patients were stimulated at either 30 or 60 days following surgery under blinded conditions. RESULTS: After 12 months of stimulation, four (66.7%) of six patients met a stringent criterion as  responders  (&gt; or =35% improvement in the Y-BOCS and end point Y-BOCS severity &lt; or =16). Patients did not improve during sham stimulation. Depressive symptoms improved significantly in the group as a whole; global functioning improved in the four responders. Adverse events associated with chronic DBS were generally mild and modifiable with setting changes. Stimulation interruption led to rapid but reversible induction of depressive symptoms in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that DBS of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum region is a promising therapy of last resort for carefully selected cases of severe and intractable OCD. Future research should attend to subject selection, lead location, DBS programming, and mechanisms underpinning therapeutic benefits.",M1
20113307,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder in postmenopausal women: prevalence, clinical features, and comorbidity.OBJECTIVE: Studies about obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) during the postmenopausal period have been insufficient. The purpose of the current study was therefore to examine the prevalence rate, clinical characteristics, and comorbidity of OCD in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A total of 269 consecutive postmenopausal women admitted to a gynaecology outpatient clinic were included in the study. OCD and comorbid disorders was diagnosed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. The Yale-Brown Obsessive- Compulsive Scale was used to determine the types of obsessions and compulsions. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of OCD was 7.1% in the sample. Two women (0.7%) reported that OCD developed during the postmenopausal period. The most common obsessions were contamination and symmetry/exactness, whereas the most common compulsions were cleaning/washing and checking. OCD was unrelated to variables examined in the present study. The comorbidity rate of other psychiatric disorders was 63.2% in OCD patients. The most common comorbid disorder was generalized anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: OCD was not rare in postmenopausal women admitted to a gynaecology outpatient clinic. In addition, OCD appears to be frequently comorbid with depressive or other anxiety disorders in the postmenopausal period.",M1
20106536,"Is there any role of Toxoplasma gondii in the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder?Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a common psychiatric illness. Although the aetiology of OCD is still unknown, the family-genetic data show that familial forms of OCD may be associated with a specific genetic susceptibility. Recent investigations have associated development of OCD with infectious illness. Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) is a common presentation of Toxoplasma gondii infection of the central nervous system (CNS). The most commonly affected CNS region in TE is the cerebral hemisphere, followed by the basal ganglia, cerebellum and brain stem. The basal ganglia has been implicated in the development of OCD. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to investigate a possible association between Toxoplasma infection and OCD. We selected 42 patients with OCD and 100 healthy volunteers, and investigated the sero-positivity rate for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The sero-positivity rate for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies among OCD patients (47.62%) was found to be significantly higher than the rate in healthy volunteers (19%). This is the first report to examine a potential association between Toxoplasma infection and OCD. The main finding of the present study is an increased level of IgG antibodies to T. gondii in OCD patients when compared with the level in healthy controls. There might be a causal relationship between chronic toxoplasmosis and the aetiology of OCD.",M1
20102301,"Treatment strategies for obsessive-compulsive disorder.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: In the last decades, the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) has improved significantly with the introduction into the clinical practice of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): this has led to a renewed interest in this condition and development of appropriate therapeutic strategies, including non-pharmacological techniques. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive and critical review of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments usually adopted in the management of OCD. MEDLINE and PubMed (1980 - 2009) databases were searched for English-language articles by using the following keywords: OCD, clomipramine, SSRIs, resistance, predictor of response, cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure and response prevention, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, neurosurgery, electroconvulsive therapy. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain an exhaustive review of the advantages and disadvantages of the treatments usually adopted in OCD, with a special focus on resistance and clinical features that can be used as predictors of response. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a common psychiatric condition that can be adequately managed with the currently available therapeutic options. Although a certain percentage of patients do not achieve complete clinical remission, improvement of some of their core symptoms permits them to live more satisfying lives and to reach a better social adjustment.",M1
20097516,"Moral thought-action fusion and <e>OCD</e> symptoms: the moderating role of religious affiliation.The empirical literature on the relationship between moral thought-action fusion (TAF) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by mixed findings. Previous studies have reported religious group differences in moral TAF and the relationship between moral TAF and religiosity. In light of those studies and considering the apparent role of moral TAF in scrupulosity, the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the possible role of religion as a moderator of the relationship between moral TAF and OCD symptoms. The results revealed that (a) Christians endorsed higher levels of moral TAF than did Jews independent of OCD symptoms; (b) religiosity was correlated with moral TAF in Christians but not in Jews, suggesting that Christian religious adherence is related to beliefs about the moral import of thoughts; and (c) moral TAF was related to OCD symptoms only in Jews. That is, for Christians, moral TAF was related to religiosity but not OCD symptoms, and for Jews, moral TAF was related to OCD symptoms but not religiosity. These results imply that moral TAF is only a marker of pathology when such beliefs are not culturally normative (e.g., as a function of religious teaching or doctrine).",M1
20097515,"Changes in disgust correspond with changes in symptoms of contamination-based <e>OCD</e>: a prospective examination of specificity.Although several studies have implicated disgust in contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there remains a paucity of research examining this relationship prospectively. To address this gap in the literature, undergraduate students (n=177) participated in a 12-week prospective study for which they completed measures of contamination-based OCD symptoms, disgust, and negative affect. Change in disgust levels over the 12-week period predicted change in symptoms of contamination-based OCD, even when controlling for age, gender, and change in negative affect. However, this association was driven by change in the perceived negative impact of experiencing disgust (disgust sensitivity) rather than change in the intensity that disgust is generally experienced (disgust propensity). Subsequent analyses also revealed that change in disgust sensitivity fully mediated the association between change in disgust propensity and change in symptoms of contamination-based OCD. The implications of these findings for further delineating the causal role of disgust-related vulnerabilities in contamination-based OCD are discussed.",M1
20095367,"Association of <e>OCD</e> with a history of traumatic events among patients in methadone maintenance treatment.INTRODUCTION: We studied the relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and lifetime history of any traumatic events among methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional sample of 167 patients, we clinically assessed for OCD using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and interviewed for their lifetime history of traumas. RESULTS: OCD was defined among 40.1% patients. Sixteen percent of patients reported having been victims of sexual abuse or rape, 21.6% had self-inflicted physical injuries, 34.1% attempted suicide, 44.9% sustained other physical violence or abuse, 28.7% were involved in a car accident as drivers and 6% as passengers, and 16.8% had significant falls. Patients with OCD compared with patients without OCD included more rape victims (28.4% vs. 9%), had more self-inflicted physical injuries (31.3% vs. 15%), and had more suicide attempts (46.3% vs. 26%), with no differences in other traumatic events exposure. The OCD group was characterized as being female (OR = 4.0 [95% CI 1.7-9.3]), having a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text-Revision Axis I psychiatric disorder (OR = 2.6 [95% CI 1.2-5.51]), being Israeli born (OR = 2.9 [95% CI 1.2-6.9]), abusing benzodiazepines (OR = 2.2 [95% CI 1.02-4.6]), having attempted suicide (OR = 2.5 [95% CI 1.1-5.4]), and having longer duration of opiate abuse before admission to MMT (OR =1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11). CONCLUSION: Awareness of this profile and specific interventions are needed in order to identify and help patients at risk, especially in preventing additional suicide attempts.",M1
20085687,"Belief in the obsessional doubt as a real probability and its relation to other obsessive-compulsive beliefs and to the severity of symptomatology.OBJECTIVES: Despite the important role of doubt in understanding obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), current cognitive models of OCD usually do not separate this initial doubt from the anticipated consequence of not ritualizing. The current study evaluates belief in the obsessional doubt as a real probability as an additional cognitive dimension of obsessive-compulsive (OC) beliefs. METHODS: One hundred and fifteen participants with OCD completed four clinical scales measuring different OC beliefs in: (a) the real probability of obsessional doubt; (b) the realism of anticipated consequences; (c) the degree of conviction in the need to perform rituals; and (d) the perceived ability to resist rituals. The severity of symptomatology was also evaluated. DESIGN: Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, correlational analyses were performed to determine the relationship between OC beliefs as well as to observe how these beliefs may be related to the severity of symptomatology and how they fluctuated over time. Regression analyses were also employed to verify which OC beliefs better predicted the perceived ability to resist rituals. RESULTS: Belief in the obsessional doubt as a real probability was significantly related to other OC beliefs. Also, levels of belief for the same doubt remained stable for a period of two weeks, but different levels of belief were observed for distinct obsessional doubts measured at the same time. Finally, belief in the obsessional doubt as a real probability better predicted the perceived ability to resist rituals than other OC beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Belief in the obsessional doubt as a real probability may be an important dimension to consider when evaluating OC beliefs in treatment resistant OCD, particularly in people who have low perceived ability to resist rituals.",M1
20080022,"Is worry a thought control strategy relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorder?Thought control strategies are implicated in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Regarding one strategy - worry - extant data provide equivocal conclusions as to its relevance to OCD. The current study examined whether worry is an OCD-relevant thought control strategy using data from a large (N=376) nonclinical sample. This investigation tested whether worry interacted with obsessive beliefs (perfectionism/certainty; responsibility/threat estimation; importance/control of thoughts) to predict the occurrence of ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts. As expected, worry did interact with obsessive beliefs to predict more reported intrusions. Contrary to expectations, worry interacted with all three assessed belief dimensions. These results provide support for conceptualizing worry as an OCD-relevant thought control strategy, which has both conceptual and therapeutic implications.",M1
20077119,"The impact of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder on the treatment response of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.Few case series studies have addressed the issue of treatment response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and there are no prospective studies addressing response to conventional treatment in OCD patients with a history of trauma (HT). The present study aimed to investigate, prospectively, the impact of HT or PTSD on two systematic, first-line treatments for OCD. Two hundred and nineteen non-treatment-resistant OCD outpatients were treated with either group cognitive-behavioral therapy (GCBT n = 147) or monotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI n = 72). Presence of HT and PTSD were assessed at intake, as part of a broader clinical and demographical baseline characterization of the sample. Severity and types of OCD symptoms were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and the Dimensional YBOCS (DYBOCS), respectively. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Both treatments had 12-week duration. Treatment response was considered as a categorical [35% or greater reduction in baseline YBOCS scores plus a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement rating of better (2) or much better (1)] and continuous variable (absolute number reduction in baseline YBOCS scores). Treatment response was compared between the OCD + HT group versus the OCD without HT group and between the OCD + PTSD group versus the OCD without PTSD group. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used when indicated. Data on HT and PTSD were available for 215 subjects. Thirty-eight subjects (17.67% of the whole sample) had a positive HT (OCD + HT group) and 22 subjects (57.89% of the OCD + HT group and 10.23% of the whole sample) met full DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The OCD + HT and OCD without HT groups presented similar response to GCBT (60% of responders in the first group and 63% of responders in the second group, p = 1.00). Regarding SSRI treatment, the difference between the response of the OCD + HT (47.4%) and OCD without HT (22.2%) groups was marginally significant (p = 0.07). In addition, the OCD + PTSD group presented a greater treatment response than the OCD without PTSD group when treatment response was considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.01). The age when the first trauma occurred had no impact on treatment response. In terms of specific OCD symptom dimensions, as measured by the DYBOCS, OCD treatment fostered greater reductions for the OCD + PTSD group than for the OCD without PTSD group in the scores of contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions, collecting and hoarding and miscellaneous obsessions and related compulsions (including illness concerns and mental rituals, among others). The OCD + PTSD group also presented a greater reduction in anxiety scores than the OCD without PTSD group (p = 0.003). The presence of HT or PTSD was not related to a poorer treatment response in this sample of non-treatment-resistant OCD patients. Unexpectedly, OCD patients with PTSD presented a greater magnitude of response when compared with OCD without PTSD patients in specific OCD symptom dimensions. Future studies are needed to clarify if trauma and PTSD have a more significant impact on the onset and clinical expression of OCD than on the conventional treatment for this condition, and whether OCD stemming from trauma would constitute a subtype of OCD with a distinct response to conventional treatment.",M1
20075645,"A single-blinded case-control study of memantine in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a common debilitating psychiatric illness that typically improves but does not remit with first-line medication and behavioral treatments. Serotonergic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and clomipramine have provided the mainstay of OCD medication management for decades. Combined dopamine/serotonergic agents such as atypical antipsychotics are presently the only OCD-augmenting strategies proven effective via randomized controlled trials. Despite increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of glutamate in OCD, no controlled trials of glutamatergic augmenting agents have been reported. METHODS: An intent-to-treat sample included 44 subjects receiving standard treatment at the McLean/Massachusetts General Hospital Intensive Residential Treatment (IRT) program, 22 of whom also received memantine augmentation. Admission, monthly and discharge measures of OCD, depression, and psychosocial functioning were collected by raters blinded to augmentation status. Matched controls were selected based on sex, initial OCD severity, psychosocial functioning, and timing of admission. The Clinical Global Improvement Scale captured global clinical change. RESULTS: Mean (SD) Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreases were 7.2 (6.4) among the cases and 4.6 (5.9) among the matched controls, reflecting mean clinical improvement among the cases (27.0% decrease) but not the controls (16.5% decrease). Mean (SD) depression severity score decreases were 5.8 (9.5) among the cases and 4.7 (9.9) among the controls. Initial intrusive obsessions were significantly more severe among marked responders compared with limited response or nonresponse cases (4.4 vs 2.9; t = 2.15; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary supportive evidence for the effectiveness of memantine as a glutamatergic augmenting agent in severe OCD. Future randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted.",M1

20068377,"A naturalistic exploratory study of the impact of demographic, phenotypic and comorbid features in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of gender, age at onset, phenotype and comorbidity in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) in children. In this naturalistic study we consider these characteristics of OCD in the framework of the 4 OCD phenotypes (contamination/cleaning, order/symmetry, obsessions/checking and hoarding) proposed by Leckman et al. SAMPLING AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 257 patients aged 13.6 +/- 2.8 years, diagnosed using a DSM-IV-based clinical interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version), were included. RESULTS: Patients with OCD onset before 12 years of age presented a higher frequency of comorbid tic disorder and disruptive behavior disorders. The type of obsession varied with gender: order/symmetry was more frequent in males, contamination/cleaning in females. Order/symmetry had the highest comorbidity with tics, contamination/cleaning was the least severe according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity, and was associated with a high rate of comorbid anxiety and depression, similarly to sexual-religious obsessions. Hoarding was the severest according to the Clinical Global Impression Severity, and was associated with a high comorbidity with social phobia and bipolar disorder. Tic comorbidity was more prevalent in males, had an earlier onset, and a heavier comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other disruptive behavior disorders. A comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was associated with an earlier onset of OCD and a poorer response to treatments. CONCLUSIONS: OCD phenotypes and comorbidities may have marked clinical and prognostic implications. Tertiary care population results may not generalize to less impaired juvenile populations.",M1
20066816,"[PANDAS: a possible model for adult <e>OCD</e> pathogenesis]Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a disabling disorder. Genetic predisposing factors may have an important role in the onset of the symptoms, but is not been individualized any specific gene yet. In the last years it has been demonstrated that obsessive-compulsive disease and/or tic syndromes may be triggered by an antecedent infection especially with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. On the basis of recent studies has been postulated that in genetically predisposed individuals, certain streptococcal antigens trigger antibodies which, through a process of molecular mimicry, cross-react with epitopes on the basal ganglia. According to such hypothesis, the acronym PANDAS has been used to describe a subset of children with abrupt onset or exacerbations of OCD or tics, or both, following streptococcal infections. Neuroimaging studies reveal increased basal ganglia volumes, and the proposed cause involves the cross-reaction of streptococcal antibodies with basal ganglia tissue. The hypothesis of a possible involvement of the immunitary system seems justified from quantitative alterations of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 in the patients' serum with such syndrome. Echotomographic studies on cardiac valves have not yet demonstrated the parallels between PANDAS and Sydenham's chorea. The use of treatment strategies, such as therapeutic plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin, has been proposed to explain the autoimmune process responsible for the pathogenesis of PANDAS. Further research is still necessary in order to understand the role of streptococcal infection in the pathogenesis of PANDAS.",M1
20056376,"Predictors of functional impairment in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.The current study examined factors associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) related functional impairment among 99 youth with OCD. A trained evaluator administered the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, items assessing family accommodation, and a version of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale that was modified for children. Youth completed the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Child Version, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Child Version, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form. The child's parent completed the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Parent Version. Results indicated that OCD symptom severity, depressive symptoms, and family accommodation were directly related to impairment, while insight was inversely related to functional impairment. Insight, family accommodation, and depressive symptoms predicted parent- and/or child-rated functional impairment above and beyond OCD symptom severity. Among symptom dimensions, contamination/cleaning and aggressive/checking symptoms were the only dimensions significantly associated with impairment. Assessment and treatment implications are discussed; specifically, we highlight how the variables of interest may impact clinical presentation and treatment course.",M1
20047724,"Psychological treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in patients with major depression: a pilot randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) in patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Participants (n = 29) diagnosed with comorbid OCD and MDD were randomized to receive standard CBT for OCD or integrated CBT that included an exclusive focus on treating MDD in the first phase of treatment and OCD in the second phase of treatment. RESULTS: Both treatments resulted in statistically significant improvements in OCD and MDD symptoms. Treatment effects and recovery rates in the intent-to-treat sample were lower in both treatments, compared with past studies that excluded patients with MDD. However, among treatment completers, both treatments resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in OCD and MDD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: CBT holds promise as an efficacious treatment for people with comorbid OCD and MDD. The high treatment dropout rate with comorbid patients suggests that additional treatment strategies are required to enhance retention and optimize clinical outcomes.",M1
20035818,"Comparison of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. with fluoxetine in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a common neuropsychiatric condition. Although a variety of pharmaceutical agents is available for the treatment of OCD, psychiatrists often find that many patients cannot tolerate the side effects of these medications; do not respond properly to the treatment; or the medications lose their effectiveness after a period of treatment. Herbal medicine can be a solution to some of these problems. In fact many herbs with psychotropic effects exist which can have fewer side effects. They can provide an alternative treatment or be used to enhance the effectiveness of conventional anti-obsessive and compulsive symptoms. Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. is a well-known medicinal plant with a long history of usage in Iran. This plant is reported to be safe on humans. Our objective in this study was to compare the efficacy of the extract of S.marianum (L.) with fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD. The study was an 8-week pilot double-blind randomized trial. Thirty five adult outpatients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD based on the structured clinical interview participated in the trial. The minimum score of Yale-Brown Scale for OCD was 21 for all patients. In this double-blind and randomized trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either capsule of the extract (600 mg/day) or fluoxetine (30 mg/day) for 8 weeks. The results showed no significant difference between the extract and fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in terms of observed side effects.",M1
20035817,"Impaired P50 suppression in fear extinction in obsessive-compulsive disorder.The processes of fear conditioning and extinction are thought to be related to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). We have reported alterations of auditory P50 suppression in human fear conditioning and extinction in healthy control subjects (Kurayama et al., 2009). In the study, P50 suppression was impaired transiently in the course of fear acquisition and extinction. In this study, we investigated the changes of P50 suppression with OCD patients in the course of the same experimental paradigm. 39 patients with OCD and 21 healthy control subjects were recruited. In the acquisition phase of classical fear conditioning, 10 pairings of the conditioned stimulus (CS; the visual stimulus from a light-emitting diode) and the unconditioned stimulus (US; the electrical stimulus to the wrist) were administered, and in the extinction phase, 10 CS without US were administered. P50 auditory evoked potentials were measured as the first stimulus sound (S1) and the second stimulus sound (S2) in double-click paradigm with a 500 ms interval. P50 S2/S1 ratio was used to evaluate P50 suppression. The mean P50 S2/S1 ratio in patients with OCD significantly elevated from baseline level during the fear acquisition as that in healthy controls, but the elevated S2/S1 ratio did not recover to baseline level. The S2/S1 ratio in the extinction phase was significantly higher in the OCD patient group than in the healthy control group. In conclusion, our data suggested that P50 sensory gating in fear extinction was impaired in patients with OCD.",M1
20035255,"Predicting the therapeutic response to cognitive behavioural therapy in patients with pharmacoresistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to establish the efficacy of CBT on the sample of non-selected medication-resistant patients with <e>OCD</e> and to search for predictors of therapeutic response in such a group. METHODS: The treatment was carried out under usual conditions at the department for anxiety disorders. Systematic CBT steps were tailored to the needs of each patient. Pharmacology treatment remained grossly unchanged during the trial period. We used the following outcome measures in the study: Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, subjective version (S-Y-BOCS), the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20) and Dissociative Experience Scale (DES). The primary outcome measure was a decrease by 35% in Y-BOCS rating. Remission was defined as a 12 point score or lower in Y-BOCS and 1 or 2 points in CGI-S. RESULTS: 47 patients completed the study (19 male and 28 female). One female patient refused to participate. All patients completed at least 5 weeks of intensive CBT programme and showed significant improvement on Y-BOCS, CGI-S, and BDI scales. At the end of the treatment 40.4% of the patients achieved clinical remission according to the CGI-S scale. The main characteristics present at the beginning of the trial increasing probability of achieving improvement or remission during the treatment were a Y-BOCS score lower than 22, good insight, higher resistance to symptoms, low level of dissociation, and aggressive obsessions. CONCLUSION: As negative predictors we identified higher scores in Y-BOCS, poorer insight, low resistance to symptoms, high level of dissociation, obsessions focused on control/symmetry and obsessive slowness/ambivalence as associated with poor improvement.",M1
20035254,"Psychological dissociation in obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with anxiety level but not with severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.OBJECTIVE: According to recent findings, clinical symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) seem be related with dissociation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of psychological dissociation and clinical characteristics in OCD. METHODS: The study sample comprised of 49 patients with OCD (55.1% females) and 45 healthy controls (66.7% females). All participants were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Dissociation was quantified by the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). RESULTS: Psychological dissociation assessed with the DES was associated with the severity of anxiety symptoms (beta=0.49, t=3.89, df=47, p&lt;0.001), but not with the level of OCD symptoms. Patients had higher level of dissociation than healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the level of psychological dissociation is associated with the severity of anxiety symptoms rather than with OCD symptoms. Further investigation of association between dissociative and anxiety states is needed.",M1
20034768,"Theory of mind in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Comparison with healthy controls.AIM: Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to represent one's own or another's mental states and has been found to be impaired in many psychiatric disorders. Our objective was to compare ToM abilities of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) with healthy controls and to investigate the relation between some illness features, other cognitive functions and ToM abilities of patients. METHOD: Thirty OCD patients and age, sex and education matched 30 healthy controls were compared according to their performances on ToM tasks (including first and second order false belief, hinting task and double-bluff task), verbal memory processes test, Weschler memory test (WMT) (logical memory, visual reproduction and digit span sub-tests), stroop test. RESULTS: Patients' performances were worse than healthy controls on all of the ToM tasks, but the results were significant for only for double-bluff task (t=-3.992, df=36.157, p&lt;0.01). Performance on double-bluff task was significantly and positively correlated with visual reproduction-immediate recall (r=-0.411, p&lt;0.05) and visual reproduction-delayed recall (r=0.478, p&lt;0.05), hinting task was significantly and positively correlated with verbal memory (r=0.481, p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: These results show  basic  ToM abilities of OCD patients are generally preserved, but they show significant reduction in their  advanced  ToM abilities, which seem to be related to their reduced memory capacities. The possible reasons for the relation between memory and ToM impairments, as well as the clinical significance of ToM deficits in OCD are discussed.",M1
20029829,"Autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders: OC behaviors, phenotypes and genetics.Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a phenotypically and etiologically heterogeneous set of disorders that include obsessive-compulsive behaviors (OCB) that partially overlap with symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). The OCB seen in ASD vary depending on the individual's mental and chronological age as well as the etiology of their ASD. Although progress has been made in the measurement of the OCB associated with ASD, more work is needed including the potential identification of heritable endophenotypes. Likewise, important progress toward the understanding of genetic influences in ASD has been made by greater refinement of relevant phenotypes using a broad range of study designs, including twin and family-genetic studies, parametric and nonparametric linkage analyses, as well as candidate gene studies and the study of rare genetic variants. These genetic analyses could lead to the refinement of the OCB phenotypes as larger samples are studied and specific associations are replicated. Like ASD, OCB are likely to prove to be multidimensional and polygenic. Some of the vulnerability genes may prove to be generalist genes influencing the phenotypic expression of both ASD and OCD while others will be specific to subcomponents of the ASD phenotype. In order to discover molecular and genetic mechanisms, collaborative approaches need to generate shared samples, resources, novel genomic technologies, as well as more refined phenotypes and innovative statistical approaches. There is a growing need to identify the range of molecular pathways involved in OCB related to ASD in order to develop novel treatment interventions.",M1
20025836,"Group versus individual cognitive treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder: Changes in severity at post-treatment and one-year follow-up.BACKGROUND: Very few studies have compared the efficacy of individual and group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (<e>OCD</e>) by taking into consideration the change in OCD severity in both the short and long term. AIMS: To conduct an open trial of individual versus group CBT for OCD, comparing the clinical and statistically significant changes in severity both at post-treatment and one year later. METHOD: Forty-two OCD subjects were assigned to individual (n = 18) or group CBT (n = 24, in four groups). Sixteen and 22 subjects completed the treatment in the individual and group conditions, respectively. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was recorded at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at the one-year follow-up. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, the clinically significant change was comparable for the two treatment conditions and remained stable at the one-year follow-up. Of the 16 participants who completed the individual CBT treatment, 68.75% were classified as recovered at post-treatment, compared to 40.9% of those receiving group CBT. At follow-up the rate of recovery decreased to 62.5% in individual CBT and to 31.8% in group CBT. CONCLUSIONS: Group CBT is effective in decreasing OCD severity. The post-treatment changes were maintained one year later. Nevertheless, these changes were higher in the individual delivery of CBT.",M1
20022385,"Socioemotional deficits associated with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.Increasing emphasis has been placed on the role of socioemotional functioning in models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). The present study investigated whether OCD symptoms were associated with capacity for theory of mind (ToM) and basic affect recognition. Non-clinical volunteers (N=204) completed self report measures of OCD and general psychopathology, in addition to behavioral measures of ToM and affect recognition. The results indicated that higher OCD symptoms were associated with reduced ToM, as well as reduced accuracy decoding the specific emotion of disgust. Importantly, these relationships could not be attributed to other, more general features of psychopathology. The findings of the current study therefore further our understanding of how the processing and interpretation of social and emotional information is affected in the context of OCD symptomatology, and are discussed in relation to neuropsychological models of OCD.",M1
20015461,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor insight: a three-year prospective study.Available evidence about the relationship between poor insight and other clinical characteristics in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is inconclusive and conflicting. There is also a paucity of data on the long-term course and treatment outcome of OCD patients with poor insight. The present study reports the findings of a relatively large sample (n=106) of outpatients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for OCD, treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and prospectively followed up for 3 years. Baseline information was collected on demographic and clinical characteristics, using standardized instruments. Insight was assessed by means of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS). Eighty-three patients were followed prospectively and evaluated systematically by validated measures of psychopathology. Compared to their good insight counterparts, the OCD patients with poor insight (22%) showed a greater severity of obsessive-compulsive and depressive symptomatology; an earlier age at onset; a higher rate of schizophrenia spectrum disorder in their first-degree relatives; a higher comorbidity with schizotypal personality disorder. During the follow-up period, poor insight OCD patients were less likely to achieve at least a partial remission of obsessive-compulsive symptoms; required a significantly greater number of therapeutic trials; received more frequently augmentation with antipsychotics. The results suggest that the specifier  poor insight  helps to identify a subgroup of patients at the more severe end of OCD spectrum, characterized by a more complex clinical presentation, a diminished response to standard pharmacological interventions, and a poorer prognosis. Further research is needed to identify alternative strategies for the management of these patients.",M1
20006424,"Unilateral deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: Outcomes after one year.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the right nucleus accumbens in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Predominantly bilateral stimulation of the anterior limb of the internal capsule was utilized. METHODS: The study was designed as a double-blind sham-controlled crossover study. Patients received 3 months of deep brain stimulation followed by 3 months of sham stimulation, or vice versa. Subsequently, stimulation was continued unblinded for all patients. The primary outcome measure was the severity level of OCD, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Secondary outcome measures were depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological symptom severity, global functioning, quality of life, and cognitive function. RESULTS: The mean Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly from 32.2 (+/-4.0) at baseline to 25.4 (+/-6.7) after 12 months (p=0.012). Five out of ten patients showed a decrease of more than 25%, indicating at least a partial response. One patient showed a decrease in Y-BOCS severity greater than 35%. Similarly, depression, global functioning and quality of life improved within one year. In contrast, anxiety, global symptom severity and cognitive function showed no significant changes. In general, DBS was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: DBS of the unilateral right nucleus accumbens showed encouraging results in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. Five out of ten patients reached at least a partial response after the first year.",M1
20004481,"Impulse-control disorders in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder.The aim of this study was to examine current prevalences, clinical correlates and patterns of co-occurrence of impulse-control disorders (ICDs) in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). We examined rates and clinical correlates of comorbid ICDs in 70 consecutive child and adolescent subjects with lifetime DSM-IV OCD (32.9% females; mean age = 13.8 +/- 2.9 years). Comorbidity data were obtained with structured clinical interviews using DSM-IV criteria. OCD severity was assessed with the Child Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. All variables were compared in OCD subjects with and without current ICDs. 12 (17.1%) subjects met criteria for a current ICD. Pathological skin picking and compulsive nail biting were the most common ICDs with current rates of 12.8% and 10.0%, respectively. OCD subjects with current ICDs were significantly more likely to have a co-occurring tic disorder (66.7% vs. 20.7%). Although having an ICD was associated with greater numerical scores of OCD symptomatology, these differences were not statistically significant. There were no sex-specific patterns of ICD occurrence in children and adolescents with OCD. Certain ICDs are common among children and adolescents with OCD. Better identification of ICDs in children and adolescents with OCD is needed, as are empirically validated treatments for youth with co-occurring ICDs.",M1
20004479,"Dissociation of decisions in ambiguous and risky situations in obsessive-compulsive disorder.Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) often show deficits in everyday decision-making, a phenomenon which is leading to a growing research interest in neuropsychological aspects of decision-making in OCD. Previous investigations of OCD patients demonstrated deficits in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a decision-making task with implicit rules. Results were interpreted as reflecting orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions observed in OCD. The aim of the present study is to investigate OCD patients' performance on the Game of Dice Task (GDT), a decision-making task with explicit and stable rules. For this purpose, 23 patients with OCD and 22 healthy comparison subjects were examined with the GDT and the IGT as well as with tests of executive functioning. While patients performed worse than comparison subjects on the IGT, they were unimpaired on the GDT and executive functioning tasks. Results further emphasize dysfunctions of the orbitofrontal cortex, but indicate intact functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with OCD.",M1
20001657,"Duration of untreated illness as a predictor of treatment response and remission in obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVES: The Duration of Untreated Illness (DUI), defined as the time elapsing between the onset of a disorder and the beginning of the first pharmacological treatment, has been increasingly investigated as a predictor of outcome and course across different psychiatric disorders. Purpose of this naturalistic study was to evaluate the influence of DUI on treatment response and remission in a sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). METHODS: Sixty-six outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD were included in the study. Patients received, according to their clinical conditions, an open pharmacological treatment of 12 weeks and were evaluated by the administration of the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline and endpoint. Treatment response was defined as a decrease .25% on Y-BOCS score compared to baseline, while remission was defined as an endpoint Y-BOCS total score #10. A logistic regression was performed considering DUI as the independent continuous variable and treatment response and remission as the dependent variables. Moreover, the sample was divided into two groups according to a categorical cut-off for the DUI of 24 months and odds ratios (OR) were calculated on the basis of the same variables. RESULTS: DUI, considered as a continuous variable, was not predictive of treatment response (OR51.00, P50.15) nor remission (OR51.00, P50.59). When considered as a categorical variable, however, a DUI # 24 months was predictive of treatment response (OR50.27, P50.03). CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present naturalistic study suggest a complicated relationship between DUI and treatment outcome in OCD encouraging further investigation with larger samples in order to better define long versus short DUI in this condition.",M1
19934996,"Preliminary study in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder treated with electrical stimulation in the inferior thalamic peduncle.OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation has been used in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Our principal objective was to determine the safety and effectiveness of deep brain stimulation of the inferior thalamic peduncle in the treatment of refractory OCD. METHODS: An open protocol was performed from March 2003 to April 2007 in 5 patients with OCD refractory to conventional treatments. Bilateral stereotactic implantation of tetrapolar electrodes was aimed at the inferior thalamic peduncle and corroborated by electrophysiological responses and magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were off stimulation for 1 month after implantation. In the on-stimulation period, parameters were set at 5 V, 450 microseconds, 130 Hz in bipolar and continuous mode. Clinical changes were evaluated every 3 months for 12 months by means of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Statistical significance was assessed by the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: The mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score decreased from 35 to 17.8 (P &lt; 0.001), and the mean Global Assessment of Functioning scale score improved from 20% to 70% (P &lt; 0.0001). The neuropsychological battery did not show significant changes, and there were no side effects related to electrical stimulation in the chronic period. CONCLUSION: We conclude that inferior thalamic peduncle stimulation is a safe procedure and may be an effective alternative in the treatment of those OCD cases refractory to conventional treatments.",M1

For them, a new stereotactic radiosurgery has been recently developed: the ventral capsular/ventral striatal (VC/VS) gamma capsulotomy. The authors aim to report efficacy and adverse events of VC/VS gamma capsulotomy. Five refractory OCD patients were selected. The authors assessed OCD, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and side effects pre- and postoperatively. Three patients (60%) met response criteria 48 months after surgery.

The cognitive behavioral treatment was compared to waitlist control and an active and credible comparison of stress management training (SMT). Of the 73 adults who were randomized, 67 completed treatment, and 58 were available for one-year follow-up. The active treatments, compared to waitlist, resulted in substantially lower YBOCS scores, <e>OCD</e>-related cognitions and depression as well as improved social functioning. Overall, CBT and SMT showed large and similar reductions in symptoms. Pre-post effect sizes on YBOCS Obsessions for CBT and SMT completers was d = 2.34 and 1.90, respectively. Although CBT showed small advantages over SMT on some symptom measures immediately after treatment, these differences were no longer apparent in the follow-up period. CBT resulted in larger changes on most OCD-related cognitions compared to SMT. The cognitive changes were stable at 12 months follow-up, but the differences in the cognitive measures faded. The robust and enduring effects of both treatments contradict the long-standing belief that obsessions are resistant to treatment.",M1
19963339,"The relationship between anxiety disorders in adults and recalled childhood teasing.This study investigated the relationship between retrospective accounts of childhood teasing and anxiety disorders as well as the relationship between experiences of teasing and more global psychological well-being. Participants (N=377) with social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), or panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (PD) were compared on levels of self-reported teasing history using the Teasing Questionnaire-Revised (TQ-R; Storch et al., 2004). Teasing frequency scores were higher for the SAD group compared to both PD and OCD groups. Across all groups, teasing scores were significantly related to increased social anxiety, depression, stress, and greater impairment in functioning. Teasing frequency accounted for unique variance in severity of SAD symptoms even after controlling for concurrent mood, anxiety and stress. These results support and extend previous findings linking childhood teasing to anxiety disorders in adulthood.",M1
19960527,"Neuropsychological performance in childhood <e>OCD</e>: a preliminary study.BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological deficits have often been found in studies of adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). However, few studies have examined such impairment in children with OCD and of those studies published, the results are mixed. METHODS: In the present study, 14 OCD children were compared to 24 healthy developing children of similar age and intellectual ability on a series of neuropsychological tests that assess response inhibition, abstract reasoning and problem solving, planning ability, verbal and nonverbal fluency, working memory, attention and information processing speed, and visual and verbal memory and learning. RESULTS: No significant differences emerged between the children with OCD and healthy controls for working memory, verbal fluency, attention, information processing speed, concept formation/abstraction, and response inhibition. We observed some deficits and a trend toward performance differences between the groups for psychomotor speed and attention, cognitive flexibility, nonverbal fluency, planning ability, and verbal memory and learning. Results are partially consistent with those found in adults with OCD. Findings were not related to depressive symptoms or self-report feeling of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary survey indicates that OCD children may have deficits for cognitive flexibility and planning ability and differ from adults with OCD in not presenting with poor response inhibition or memory deficits. Larger, multi-site studies are warranted to help delineate the neurocognitive deficits associated with childhood OCD.",M1
19960488,"Barriers to treatment seeking for anxiety disorders: initial data on the role of mental health literacy.BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders represent the single largest mental health problem in the United States [Greenberg et al., 1999. J Clin Psychiatry 60:427-435; Rice and Miller, 1998. Br J Psychiatry 173:4-9]. However most individuals with anxiety disorders never seek treatment [Henderson et al., 2002. Can J Psychiatry 47:819-824; Mojtabai et al., 2002. Arch Gen Psychiatry 59:77-84; Roness et al., 2005. Acta Psychiatr Scand 111:51-58]. Deficits in the ability to recognize anxiety disorders and beliefs about them, (i.e.,  mental health literacy ) may contribute to low levels of help seeking. METHODS: Survey data assessing mental health literacy for multiple anxiety disorders and for depression were collected from 284 undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at a public university in the United States. Specifically, respondents were presented with vignettes portraying individuals experiencing various forms of mental illness and were asked to label the disorder, its cause and whether or not they would recommend treatment. RESULTS: Findings showed that social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) were associated with recognition rates that were generally high and similar to depression (approximately 80%). In contrast, less than half of the respondents labeled panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) correctly. Symptoms of OCD were attributed to mental illness by approximately 50% of respondents, but such attributions were rare for the other anxiety disorders studied (&lt;12%). Finally, data on help-seeking recommendations suggested that such recommendations are far from universal and varied between different anxiety disorders and according to perceptions of the causes of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the current sample was well-educated young adults, mental health literacy of the general public may be even lower.",M1
19958042,"Ondansetron augmentation in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder: a preliminary, single-blind, prospective study.Serotonin and dopamine neuronal systems have been implicated in the modulation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) symptoms. About 40% of OCD patients do not respond to first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment; among those, dopamine blocker augmentation has been reported to improve the rate of response by an additional one-third. Given that serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors are indirect inhibitors of cortico-mesolimbic dopamine release, augmentation with the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist ondansetron in combination with SSRIs and antipsychotics has potential efficacy in treatment-resistant OCD patients. To assess the efficacy and tolerability of ondansetron in combination with SSRIs and antipsychotics in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. In total, 14 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD, who were treatment resistant and receiving stable treatment with SSRIs and antipsychotic augmentation, entered a 12-week, single-blind trial of ondansetron. The drug was initiated at a dosage of 0.25 mg twice daily for 6 weeks and was then titrated to 0.5 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. Of the 14 patients, nine (64.3%) experienced a treatment response (&gt; or =25% reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [YBOCS] score and a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I] score of 1 or 2) at 12 weeks. The average reduction in YBOCS-rated symptoms for the whole group was 23.2%. None of the treated patients experienced symptom exacerbation or significant adverse effects. These results suggest that low-dose ondansetron may have promise as an augmentation strategy for some patients with OCD resistant to SSRIs and antipsychotic augmentation, but further controlled trials are required.

19949720,"Reduced cortical folding of the anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) abnormalities have been implicated consistently in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), yet it remains unclear whether these abnormalities originated during early neurodevelopment. In this study, we examined the ACC sulcal/gyral patterns to investigate whether neurodevelopmental anomalies of the ACC were present in patients with OCD. We hypothesized that patients with OCD would show reduced cortical folding of the ACC compared with controls. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 169 healthy volunteers and 110 patients with OCD to examine the paracingulate sulcus and cingulate sulcus. We assessed cortical folding patterns according to established classification criteria and constructed 3 categories of paracingulate sulcus morphology according to its presence and anteroposterior extent:  prominent,   present  and  absent.  We classified the cingulate sulcus as  interrupted  or  continuous  according to the interruptions in its course. In addition, we evaluated ACC sulcal asymmetry based on interhemispheric comparisons of paracingulate sulcus morphology. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that patients with OCD were significantly less likely than controls to show a well-developed left paracingulate sulcus: 50.0% of patients and 65.1% of controls showed a  prominent  or  present  paracingulate sulcus in the left hemisphere. However, there were no differences in regard to cingulate sulcus continuity, and patients also showed the same leftward ACC sulcal asymmetry as controls. LIMITATIONS: Our study was limited by the fact that we obtained the MRI scans from 2 different scanners, and we did not calculate cerebral fissurization as our study was restricted to 1 specific brain region. Moreover, patients and controls differed significantly in terms of sex ratio and IQ, although we controlled these variables as covariates. CONCLUSION: Our findings imply a subtle deviation in the early neurodevelopment of the ACC in patients with OCD, but the extent to which these anomalies contributed to the pathogenesis of OCD remains unclear. Further studies that link the ACC morphologic anomalies to the pathophysiology of OCD are recommended.",M1

An investigation of factors involved in compulsive behavior in <e>OCD</e> and depression.Excessive reassurance-seeking (ERS) is a common problem among both obsessive-compulsive and depressed populations. However, the content and cognitive processes involved in ERS may differ in these populations according to the unique cognitive and behavioral characteristics demonstrated by each group. To assess factors involved in the onset, maintenance and termination of ERS and repeated checking, the current investigation employed a semi-structured interview with non-depressed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) respondents (n=15), clinically depressed individuals without OCD (n=15), and healthy control participants (n=20). Results showed that whereas individuals with OCD reported seeking reassurance primarily about perceived general threats (e.g., fire, theft), the depressed group reported seeking reassurance primarily about perceived social threats (e.g., abandonment, loss of support). Clinical participants reported greater anxiety, sadness and perceived threat in association with ERS and repeated checking than healthy control participants. These findings are discussed in terms of cognitive-behavioral models of OCD and depression.",M1
19933442,"Relationship of exposure to clinically irrelevant emotion cues and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.Research has highlighted the role of emotion regulation as a common factor underlying emotional disorders. The current study examined the relationship of emotion regulation skills to obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) symptoms. Seven participants with a principal diagnosis of OCD in a multiple-baseline across subjects design were taught the skill of prevention of emotional avoidance in the context of emotion provocation procedures to clinically irrelevant (nonspecific) cues prior to practicing this skill with clinically relevant (OCD-specific) cues. Results suggested successful acquisition of emotion regulation skills (as evidenced by decreased thought suppression and increased acceptance of thoughts and feelings) in clinically irrelevant contexts. Acquisition of this skill was associated with decreases in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, even though clinically relevant cues were not introduced during this phase. Implementation of skills in clinically relevant contexts was associated with greater reductions in OCD symptoms.

19932831,"Development of a computer-based behavioral assessment of checking behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current study was to develop and obtain preliminary psychometric data for a computer-based behavioral measure of compulsive checking behavior in a sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). METHOD: We examined performance on a novel behavioral measure in 30 patients with OCD and 27 matched healthy controls. In the computerized assessment, participants navigated through two virtual environments (home and office) using a joystick and head-mounted display. The experiment consisted of three phases: training, distraction, and the main task. After the training and distraction phases, participants were instructed to check the virtual environments freely as if they were in their natural environment. Primary dependent variables in the current study included several indices of frequency and duration of checking behaviors. We examined construct validity for the task by comparing the novel behavioral measures with standardized self-report and interviewer-rated measures. RESULTS: Results indicated that (1) OCD patients demonstrated significantly greater problems with compulsive checking compared to controls, and (2) performance on the task was positively correlated with both self-reported symptoms and interviewer-rated measures associated with OCD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary data to support the use of this task as a new possible behavioral measure of compulsive checking behavior in OCD. If we merge the traditional behavioral research with this novel and ecologically valid method, it could improve the assessment of OCD in both clinical and research setting.",M1
19926074,"Predicting outcome of treatment for severe, treatment resistant <e>OCD</e> in inpatient and community settings.Treatment of OCD is effective, even for the most chronic and severe cases. It has been difficult to identify predictors of treatment outcome, with little work aimed at predicting treatment outcome in severe OCD. We examined the ability of a range of demographic and psychopathology variables to predict treatment outcome in a cohort of 52 inpatients and a second group of 62 community outpatients with severe, treatment-refractory OCD. Despite both cohorts showing significant improvement in OCD symptoms, reliable predictors were difficult to identify, and were different in the two cohorts. In the inpatient group, marital status was a significant predictor, with those who were married or cohabiting showing better outcome that those not currently in a relationship. This relationship was not observed in the community treatment group. Initial symptom severity was also found to be a significant predictor, but only in the community treatment group, where higher initial severity was associated with greater reduction in symptoms during treatment. Further research examining a wider range of predictors may assist in identifying those factors which predict outcome in severe OCD.",M1
19923009,"Suicidal ideation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.The risk factors for suicidal behaviour in obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) have been less studied compared than in other anxiety disorders. In the present study, we examined the demographic and clinical correlates of current suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with OCD. Forty-four patients were grouped into those with (n=23) and without current SI (n=21) as assessed by the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to assess the obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. Following Bonferroni correction, only the severity of depression differed significantly between the two groups. The presence of major depression and aggressive obsessions, the level of hopelessness, and the severity of OC symptomatology were significant predictors of current SI in patients with OCD. The relatively low frequency of some comorbid Axis I disorders is based on small sample size and therefore may be vulnerable to type II error. We did not examine the relationship between the recent suicidal attempts and OCD. Also, we did not assess the effect of impulsivity in the occurrence of SI in patients with OCD. Associated depression, hopelessness, and aggressive obsessions might play an important role in the occurrence of SI in patients with OCD. However, future studies with a psychological autopsy design are required to systematically determine the presence for OCD among those who have completed suicide.",M1
19913659,"The PANDAS subgroup of tic disorders and childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder.Diagnosis and treatment of the PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) variant of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) are still controversial issues. Most cross-sectional studies confirm a significant association between GTS and the development of an immune response against group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). Moreover, longitudinal retrospective studies suggest that a recent exposure to GABHS might be a risk factor for the onset of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. However, further evidence from longitudinal prospective research is needed to verify whether a temporal association between GABHS infections and symptom exacerbations is a useful and reliable criterion for the diagnosis of PANDAS. In addition, preliminary results suggest that the PANDAS spectrum might be enlarged to include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although a number of immunological biomarkers have been proposed as markers of the PANDAS variant, at present, none of these has been conclusively proved useful to diagnose and monitor disease course in children with a suspicion of PANDAS. Finally, despite their empirical use in community settings, we still lack conclusive, evidence-based data regarding the usefulness of antibiotic and immunomodulatory treatments in children with PANDAS. Given the relevance of this topic for general pediatric health, additional research efforts to solve all the pending issues and the hottest points of debate are warranted.",M1
19913658,"The genetics of Tourette syndrome: a review.OBJECTIVES: This article summarizes and evaluates recent advances in the genetics of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS). METHODS: This is a review of recent literature focusing on (1) the genetic etiology of GTS; (2) common genetic components of GTS, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>); (3) recent linkage studies of GTS; (4) chromosomal translocations in GTS; and (5) candidate gene studies. RESULTS: Family, twin, and segregation studies provide strong evidence for the genetic nature of GTS. GTS is a heterogeneous disorder with complex inheritance patterns and phenotypic manifestations. Family studies of GTS and OCD indicate that an early-onset form of OCD is likely to share common genetic factors with GTS. While there apparently is an etiological relationship between GTS and ADHD, it appears that the common form of ADHD does not share genetic factors with GTS. The largest genome wide linkage study to date observed evidence for linkage on chromosome 2p23.2 (P=3.8x10(-5)). No causative candidate genes have been identified, and recent studies suggest that the newly identified candidate gene SLITRK1 is not a significant risk gene for the majority of individuals with GTS. CONCLUSION: The genetics of GTS are complex and not well understood. The Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) design can hopefully overcome the limitations of linkage and candidate gene studies. However, large-scale collaborations are needed to provide enough power to utilize the GWAS design for discovery of causative mutations. Knowledge of susceptibility mutations and biological pathways involved should eventually lead to new treatment paradigms for GTS.",M1
19913654,"Clinical course of Tourette syndrome.OBJECTIVE: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting at least a year in duration. Children with TS often experience comorbid conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and attention-deficit disorder. The goal of this article was to review the long-term clinical course of tics and comorbid conditions in children with TS. METHOD: We conducted a traditional literature search to locate relevant articles regarding long-term outcome and prognosis in TS and tic disorders. RESULTS: Tics typically have an onset between the ages of 4 and 6 years and reach their worst-ever severity between the ages of 10 and 12 years. On average, tic severity declines during adolescence. By early adulthood, roughly three-quarters of children with TS will have greatly diminished tic symptoms and over one-third will be tic free. Comorbid conditions, such as OCD and other anxiety and depressive disorders, are more common during the adolescence and early adulthood of individuals with TS than in the general population. CONCLUSION: Although tics are the sine qua non of TS, they are often not the most enduring or impairing symptoms in children with TS. Measures used to enhance self-esteem, such as encouraging strong friendships and the exploration of interests, are crucial to ensuring positive adulthood outcome in TS.",M1
19913653,"Clinical phenomenology and phenotype variability in Tourette syndrome.Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a rich phenomenology that includes simple and complex motor and vocal tics as well as multiple comorbidities.

From a psychopathology perspective, TS is often concurrent with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); these disorders appear to define TS  types  TS only, TS+OCD, and TS+OCD+ADHD. Additional clinical aspects of TS include more frequent than expected occurrence of anger episodes, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, learning disorders, and pervasive developmental disorders.

OCD patients showed significantly lower FA and altered PDD along the corpus callosum, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. The track-based analysis of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus confirmed a significant bilateral FA reduction. Lower FA values in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum correlated with symptom severity and neuropsychological performance. This multi-parameter MRI study revealed specific white matter abnormalities in OCD suggesting tract disorganization as main feature, reflected by local changes in fiber directionality. This altered anatomical connectivity might play a specific role in OCD pathophysiology.",M1
19906516,"A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of inhibitory control in obsessive-compulsive disorder.People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) have abnormalities in cognitive and motor inhibition, and it has been proposed that these are related to dysfunction of fronto-striatal circuits. However, nobody has investigated neuro-functional abnormalities during a range of inhibition tasks in adults with OCD. The aims of the study were to compare brain activation of people with OCD and controls during three tasks of inhibitory control. Ten unmedicated adults with OCD and 11 healthy controls performed three different tasks of motor and cognitive inhibitory control during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging: a Go/No-go task (motor inhibition), a motor Stroop task (interference inhibition) and a Switch task (cognitive flexibility). People with OCD displayed significantly different patterns of brain activation compared to controls during all three tasks. During the Go/No-go and Switch experiments, people with OCD had underactivation in task-relevant orbitofrontal/dorsolateral prefrontal, striatal and thalamic regions. During the motor Stroop and Switch tasks, people with OCD also displayed underactivation in temporo-parietal areas. In the Go/No-go and motor Stroop tasks the OCD group showed increased activation compared to controls in cerebellum and predominantly posterior brain regions. OCD is associated with task-relevant fronto-striatal dysfunction during motor inhibition and cognitive switching. In addition, parieto-temporal dysfunction was observed during tasks with a higher attentional load.",M1
19890235,"Prevalence of psychotic disorders in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.INTRODUCTION: The co-occurrence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders has been increasingly recognized. However, the rate of psychosis comorbidity in OCD patients has yet to be systematically evaluated. METHODS: The prevalence of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition psychotic disorders was evaluated in 757 subjects consecutively referred to a specialised diagnostic and treatment facility for OCD. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen OCD patients (1.7%) also met the DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic disorder. We found no significant differences in clinical characteristic between OCD patients with and without a psychotic disorder, although patients with OCD and a psychotic disorder more likely used illicit substances and more likely were male. CONCLUSION: Relatively few patients referred to a specialized treatment OCD center suffer from a psychotic disorder.",M1
19884611,"Association of the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 with atypical antipsychotics-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms.CONTEXT: Several studies have indicated that atypical antipsychotics (AAP) induce obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Research exploring the mechanism of this phenomenon, however, has been extremely limited. Considering the indirect evidence of genetic control and difficulties in developing animal models and performing gene expression studies, genetic association studies could be an important approach to understanding the molecular mechanism of AAP-induced OC symptoms. The glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1, which was recently reported to be associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), is a promising candidate gene for susceptibility to AAP-induced OC symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether polymorphisms in SLC1A1 are associated with AAP-induced OC symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A pharmacogenetic case-control association study. SETTING: Outpatient schizophrenia clinics. PATIENTS: Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia who were receiving AAP treatment (n = 94; OC group). The OC group consisted of 40 patients with AAP-induced OC symptoms, and the non-OC group consisted of 54 patients who had received AAP for more than 24 months without developing OC symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies. The association was tested with a logistic regression model using age, sex, and medication type as covariates. RESULTS: Trends of association were observed in rs2228622 and rs3780412 (nominal P = .01; adjusted permutation P = .07) for the dominant model that was the inheritance model that best fit our data. In the haplotype -based analysis, the A/C/G haplotype at rs2228622-rs3780413-rs3780412 showed a significant association with AAP-induced OC symptoms; this association withstood multiple test correction (nominal P = .01; adjusted permutation P = .04; odds ratio, 3.955; 95% confidence interval, 1.366-11.452, for dominant model). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sequence variations in SLC1A1 are associated with susceptibility to AAP-induced OC symptoms. This is the first published pharmacogenetic study on this phenomenon and provides preliminary evidence of the involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of AAP-induced OC symptoms.",M1
19884607,"Altered corticostriatal functional connectivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder.CONTEXT: Neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) emphasize disturbances in the function and connectivity of brain corticostriatal networks, or  loops.  Although neuroimaging studies of patients have supported this network model of OCD, very few have applied measurements that are sensitive to brain connectivity features. OBJECTIVE: Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested the hypothesis that OCD is associated with disturbances in the functional connectivity of primarily ventral corticostriatal regions, measured from coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. DESIGN: Case-control cross-sectional study. SETTING: Hospital referral OCD unit and magnetic resonance imaging facility. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21 patients with OCD (10 men, 11 women) and 21 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and estimated intelligence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Voxelwise statistical parametric maps testing the strength of functional connectivity of 4 striatal seed regions of interest (dorsal caudate nucleus, ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens, dorsal putamen, and ventral putamen) with remaining brain areas. RESULTS: For both groups, there was a clear distinction in the pattern of cortical connectivity of dorsal and ventral striatal regions, consistent with the notion of segregated motor, associative, and limbic corticostriatal networks. Between groups, patients with OCD had significantly increased functional connectivity along a ventral corticostriatal axis, implicating the orbitofrontal cortex and surrounding areas. The specific strength of connectivity between the ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens and the anterior orbitofrontal cortex predicted patients' overall symptom severity (r(2) = 0.57; P &lt; .001). Additionally, patients with OCD showed evidence of reduced functional connectivity of the dorsal striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex, and of the ventral striatum with the region of the midbrain ventral tegmental area. CONCLUSIONS: This study directly supports the hypothesis that OCD is associated with functional alterations of brain corticostriatal networks. Specifically, our findings emphasize abnormal and heightened functional connectivity of ventrolimbic corticostriatal regions in patients with OCD.",M1
19880927,"Voxel-wise meta-analysis of grey matter changes in obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: Specific cortico-striato-thalamic circuits are hypothesised to mediate the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), but structural neuroimaging studies have been inconsistent. AIMS: To conduct a meta-analysis of published and unpublished voxel-based morphometry studies in OCD. METHOD: Twelve data-sets comprising 401 people with OCD and 376 healthy controls met inclusion criteria. A new improved voxel-based meta-analytic method, signed differential mapping (SDM), was developed to examine regions of increased and decreased grey matter volume in the OCD group v. control group. Results No between-group differences were found in global grey matter volumes. People with OCD had increased regional grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, as well as decreased volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. A descriptive analysis of quartiles, a sensitivity analysis as well as analyses of subgroups further confirmed these findings. Meta-regression analyses showed that studies that included individuals with more severe OCD were significantly more likely to report increased grey matter volumes in the basal ganglia. No effect of current antidepressant treatment was observed. Conclusions The results support a dorsal prefrontal-striatal model of the disorder and raise the question of whether functional alterations in other brain regions commonly associated with OCD, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, may reflect secondary compensatory strategies. Whether the reported differences between participants with OCD and controls precede the onset of the symptoms and whether they are specific to OCD remains to be established.",M1
19861150,"The glutamate-based genetic immune hypothesis in obsessive-compulsive disorder. An integrative approach from genes to symptoms.Recent advances in multiple areas of research have contributed to the identification of several pathophysiological factors underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). In particular, the glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 has been associated with the diagnosis of OCD. Immunological and infectious studies have reported alterations of the immune system and the presence of immune complexes directed against the Borna disease virus in OCD patients. In addition, neuroimaging of OCD patients has demonstrated abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and the basal ganglia. Neuropsychological assessments have found several cognitive disruptions that have been identified in OCD, especially impairments in cognitive flexibility. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap between these remarkable findings through several previously unpredicted pathophysiological mechanisms. We propose an integrative hypothesis that indicates how genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the structural and functional alterations of cortico-subcortical circuits, leading to the characteristic cognitive disruptions underlying OCD symptoms.",M1
19853982,"Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder.Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a chronic and debilitating condition that is relatively common in both children and adults, and it is associated with a wide range of functional impairments. Mental health researchers and practitioners have placed considerable attention on OCD over the past two decades, with the goal of advancing treatment and understanding its etiology. Until recently, it was unknown to what extent this disorder was associated with functional impairment. However, recent research shows that the condition has significant social and occupational liabilities. This article discusses etiology, common symptom presentations (including comorbid and ancillary symptoms), basic OCD subtypes, neuropsychological functioning, and the relation these have with functional disability in OCD. Recommendations for future research are also considered.",M1
19852877,"Learning the futility of the thought suppression enterprise in normal experience and in obsessive compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: The belief that we can control our thoughts is not inevitably adaptive, particularly when it fuels mental control activities that have ironic unintended consequences. The conviction that the mind can and should be controlled can prompt people to suppress unwanted thoughts, and so can set the stage for the intrusive return of those very thoughts. An important question is whether or not these beliefs about the control of thoughts can be reduced experimentally. One possibility is that behavioral experiments aimed at revealing the ironic return of suppressed thoughts might create a lesson that could reduce unrealistic beliefs about the control of thoughts. AIMS: The present research assessed the influence of the thought suppression demonstration on beliefs about the control of thoughts in a non-clinical sample, and among individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). METHOD: In Study 1, we assessed the effect of the thought suppression demonstration on beliefs about the control of thoughts among low and high obsessive individuals in the non-clinical population (N = 62). In Study 2, we conducted a similar study with individuals with OCD (N = 29). RESULTS: Results suggest that high obsessive individuals in the non-clinical population are able to learn the futility of suppression through the thought suppression demonstration and to alter their faulty beliefs about the control of thoughts; however, for individuals with OCD, the demonstration may be insufficient for altering underlying beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: For individuals with OCD, the connection between suppressing a neutral thought in the suppression demonstration and suppressing a personally relevant obsession may need to be stated explicitly in order to affect their obsessive beliefs.",M1
19845090," I can't let anything go:  A case study with psychological testing of a patient with pathologic hoarding.Pathologic hoarding is a symptom generally recognized as related to obsessional dynamics (Gutheil, 1959). The hoarder cannot, without great anxiety, tolerate separation from or dispose of his possessions. Thus the hoarder accumulates vast amount of possessions, often in such amounts as to compromise freedom of movement in the residence. Popular in tabloid reportage, such news items portray persons found dead among floor-to-ceiling piles of old newspapers and similar detritus, while in actual clinical practice such dramatic cases are not common (Bryk, 2005; Duenwald, 2004). More importantly, such individuals are rarely available for psychological intervention or testing, both because of social isolation and injury or death caused by the hoarded materials. Additionally, a majority of the current literature regarding hoarding is linked with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (<e>OCD</e>), though other major disorders have been noted. This report describes a particular individual with characteristic features of hoarding, which is explored through formal psychological testing.",M1
19845089,"Is a psychodynamic perspective relevant to the clinical management of obsessive-compulsive disorder?Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) can be a severe and disabling condition with considerable variability in clinical presentation, course, and treatment response. Based upon demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have become the treatments of choice for patients with OCD. By contrast, psychodynamic formulations and treatments are often considered irrelevant or contraindicated. In the present paper, the authors present five clinical cases of OCD where psychodynamic understanding and/or treatment was essential for optimizing outcome. The authors suggest that a careful psychosocial history and dynamic formulation can enrich understanding in patients with OCD and may sometimes point to alternative or supplementary treatments. Psychodynamic interventions may be considered for two subgroups of patients: those with late-onset OCD that coincides with interpersonal stressors, and those having borderline personality disorder, for whom specialized forms of treatment, such as dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, may be indicated.",M1
19842168,"The impact of neuropsychological functioning on treatment outcome in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: Scant research has examined the effect of neuropsychological (NP) functioning on treatment outcome in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). This study sought to address this gap in existing research. METHODS: A total of 63 youths were included in this study and asked to complete the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) and specific subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III). RESULTS: Analyses suggest that 5 min recall accuracy (raw score) and percent recall from the ROCF, assessed before treatment may be predictors of treatment response among children with OCD. What is more, exploratory post hoc analyses indicated that performance on these ROCF tasks is particularly relevant among youths receiving cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) alone. These results may be driven by executive functioning ability. Additional analyses suggest a relationship between age, symptom severity, and NP functioning on select tasks from both the ROCF and WISC-III. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations exist, these findings suggest that poorer performance on the ROCF and, in turn, poorer response to treatment, particularly among those youths receiving CBT alone, may be due to executive functioning difficulties. Clinicians and researchers should be sensitive to this fact and may warrant modification(s) to existing treatment protocols. Limitations to this study, however, suggest the need for replication and extension of these findings in the future.",M1
19840596,"Temperament and character in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the differences between personality traits of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) and normal controls using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and to examine the relationship of personality traits and the severity of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. We also aimed to examine the influence a particular personality trait might have on the 5 factor-analyzed symptom dimension scores of OCD. METHOD: We recruited 130 patients with OCD and 185 age- and sex-matched normal controls. All subjects completed the TCI. Patients with OCD were assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the factor-analyzed symptom dimension scores from the Y-BOCS checklist. RESULTS: Patients with OCD had higher harm avoidance scores and lower self-directedness (SD), reward dependence (RD), and cooperativeness (C) scores than the controls. Lower SD scores and lower C scores were associated with OC symptom severity measured by the Y-BOCS after adjusting for age and depression severity. Hoarding dimension of OC symptoms was associated with lower SD scores and higher persistence (P) scores after adjusting for age, OC symptom severity, and depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in TCI subscales between patients with OCD and controls. Particular personality traits may have an influence on the severity and the dimensions of OC symptoms.",M1
19840587,"Postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder: prevalence and clinical characteristics.OBJECTIVE: The principal aims of this study were to examine the prevalence rate, clinical characteristics, and related factors of postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). METHOD: The subjects were a nonclinical sample of 400 postpartum women. They were interviewed from the 2nd up to the 26th week after birth. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used for diagnosis of OCD, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Checklist was used to determine the types of obsessions and compulsions, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders was used to diagnose comorbid depressive episode. RESULTS: Thirty-six (9%) of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for OCD according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and 9 (2.3%) reported postpartum onset OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder was more frequent in mothers with personal history of previous psychiatric disorder, somatic disease, or obstetric complication in pregnancy/birth, and who were multiparous. The most common obsessions were aggressive, contamination and miscellaneous, and compulsion for washing/cleaning and checking, and 38.9% have a comorbid depressive episode. CONCLUSION: Women have increased risk of OCD or obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the postpartum period. For this reason, all women, particularly women with previous psychiatric history, somatic disease, or with complications in pregnancy or at the birth should be carefully screened for OCD in the postpartum period.",M1
19833320,"Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections and psychosocial stress predict future tic and obsessive-compulsive symptom severity in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder.BACKGROUND: One goal of this prospective longitudinal study was to identify new group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections (GABHS) in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS) and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) compared with healthy control subjects. We then examined the power of GABHS infections and measures of psychosocial stress to predict future tic, obsessive-compulsive (OC), and depressive symptom severity. METHODS: Consecutive ratings of tic, OC, and depressive symptom severity were obtained for 45 cases and 41 matched control subjects over a 2-year period. Clinical raters were blinded to the results of laboratory tests. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical ratings. Structural equation modeling for unbalanced repeated measures was used to assess the sequence of new GABHS infections and psychosocial stress and their impact on future symptom severity. RESULTS: Increases in tic and OC symptom severity did not occur after every new GABHS infection. However, the structural equation model found that these newly diagnosed infections were predictive of modest increases in future tic and OC symptom severity but did not predict future depressive symptom severity. In addition, the inclusion of new infections in the model greatly enhanced, by a factor of three, the power of psychosocial stress in predicting future tic and OC symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a minority of children with TS and early-onset OCD were sensitive to antecedent GABHS infections. These infections also enhanced the predictive power of current psychosocial stress on future tic and OC symptom severity.",M1
19827221,"Tourette syndrome-associated psychopathology: roles of comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.OBJECTIVE: Individuals with Tourette syndrome (TS) often display comorbid symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>), as well as externalizing and internalizing behaviors. This study was aimed to examine the impacts of tic severity, ADHD symptoms, and OCD on internalizing (e.g., anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., aggression) psychopathology. METHODS: Using linear regressions, we examined how tics, ADHD, and OCD symptoms predicted the externalization and internalization behaviors measured by the Child Behavior Checklist in a clinical sample of children and adolescents with TS. In addition, Child Behavior Checklist scales were compared among children with TS without ADHD, TS and ADHD, ADHD without TS, and unaffected control group. RESULTS: In the TS group, externalizing behaviors were predicted by tic severity, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity but not by OCD symptoms, whereas internalizing behaviors were predicted by inattention and OCD symptoms but not by tic severity or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Comparison among different clinical groups revealed main effects of TS and ADHD on both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tics, ADHD, and OCD symptoms differentially explain the variance in externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems in individuals with TS. In addition, the data support the notion that TS is itself a risk factor for behavioral problems, mandating that children with TS even without ADHD and OCD still need to be assessed and treated for psychopathology.",M1
19819560,"Perseveration and not strategic deficits underlie delayed alternation impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>).The claim that the prefrontal cortex, particularly its orbito-frontal part, is involved in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is based upon evidence from neuroimaging as well as behavioral studies. Studies have repeatedly suggested problems with delayed alternation learning in OCD, an executive dysfunction that presumably involves the orbito-frontal cortex. However, it is unclear whether such impairment stems from perseveration or strategic deficits as these aspects are intertwined in the original task. In the present study, 36 OCD and 16 healthy controls underwent a variant of the delayed alternation task involving three response options instead of two as in the original task. This modification enabled us to separate perseveration errors (i.e., the participant incorrectly chooses the same response option as before) from shift errors (i.e., the decision is switched to an incorrect response alternative). We found that patients with OCD committed significantly more perseveration errors following previously valid response options, whereas perseveration for previously invalid responses and shift errors did not distinguish groups. Group differences were not accounted for by comorbid depression and may be linked to the pathogenesis of OCD.",M1
19819024,"Cross-species models of <e>OCD</e> spectrum disorders.Several axis-I neuropsychiatric disorders are characterised by repetitive motor habits suggestive of underlying inhibitory dyscontrol, and may constitute members of a putative obsessive-compulsive (OC) spectrum. Notable examples include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and trichotillomania (repetitive hair-pulling). Multiple tiers of evidence link these conditions with underlying dysregulation of fronto-striatal circuitry and monoamine systems. These abnormalities represent key targets for existing and novel treatment interventions. Nonetheless, the brain bases of these conditions, and treatment mechanisms, remain poorly characterised. Animal models of repetitive habits and inhibitory control problems show great potential for augmenting our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of OC spectrum conditions. Here, we begin by describing clinical features of OC spectrum disorders, and criteria used to assess the validity of animal models of symptomatology. Namely, face validity (phenomenological similarity between inducing conditions and specific symptoms of the human phenomenon), predictive validity (similarity in response to treatment) and construct validity (similarity in underlying physiological or psychological mechanisms). We then survey animal models of OC spectrum conditions within this framework, focusing on (i) ethological models; (ii) genetic and pharmacological models; and (iii) behavioral models. Key future research directions are highlighted.",M1
19819022,"Overview of genetics and obsessive-compulsive disorder.This paper reviews the current state of research into the genetics of obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Heredity has a major role in OCD etiology. This evidence comes from several methodological approaches such as family, twin, and segregation analysis studies. A major single gene effect as well as a polygenic hypothesis has been suggested based on segregation studies. In addition, candidate gene association and linkage analyses have shown not only one gene, but a few interesting genes and areas of the genome that may be relevant in OCD. In this search for genes, new definitions of the OCD phenotype have emerged, and some of them may be considered intermediate phenotypes between the gene effect and OCD-DSM-IV diagnosis. The phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of OCD magnifies the challenge of locating susceptibility genes; at the same time, the identification of vulnerability genes will elucidate the identification of subtypes or dimensions of the disorder. Therefore research strategies that take advantage of clinical subtyping and that redefine the OCD phenotype in the context of genetic studies may potentially contribute to the nosology of OCD and ultimately pathophysiology. There is a lack of understanding about how genes and environment interact in OCD. However, there are some reports that will be discussed, which have attempted to evaluate how the environment contributes to OCD.",M1
19815296,"Neurological considerations: autism and Parkinson's disease.Within the spectrum of disorders that manifest obsessive-compulsive (OC) features lies a sub-cluster of neurological conditions. Autism and Parkinson's disease (PD) are examples of two such neurological disorders that seem quite dissimilar on the surface. Yet, both conditions can include repetitive behaviors of a compulsive-impulsive nature. Furthermore, while autism and PD differ in other associated symptom domains that shape the course of each disorder, both disorders share some phenomenology in the core domain of repetitive behaviors and involve basal ganglia and frontal lobe dysfunction, similar to OC disorder (<e>OCD</e>). Accordingly, examination of the similarities and differences between autism and PD may provide insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of OC spectrum disorders. The current review focuses on the phenomenology, comorbidity, course of illness, family history, brain circuitry, and treatment of autism and PD, as they relate to OCD and OC spectrum disturbances.",M1

Specific ICDs share clinical, phenomenological and biological features with obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) that have suggested that these disorders might be categorized together. However, other data suggest significant differences between OCD and ICDs.

19811839,"Cross-cutting issues and future directions for the <e>OCD</e> spectrum.The research planning agenda for DSM-V examined possible similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, familial and genetic features, brain circuitry, and treatment response between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and several related disorders that are characterized by repetitive thoughts or behaviors. Such data support a re-examination of the DSM-IV-TR classification of OCD and the anxiety disorders, with possible inclusion of a group of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSDs) in DSM-V. Various disorders were systematically examined for inclusion in such a grouping, and later a smaller number were determined to meet threshold criteria for inclusion in the OCSDs. The disorders that were originally examined included OCD, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), Tourette's syndrome (TS) and other tic disorders, Sydenham's chorea, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS), trichotillomania (TTM), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), autism, eating disorders, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, impulse control disorders, as well as substance and behavioral addictions. Certain disorders such as BDD, OCPD, TS, and TTM share many commonalities with OCD in phenomenology, comorbidity, familial and genetic features, brain circuitry, and treatment response. Other disorders, such as the impulse control disorders (ICDs) share some common features with OCD, but also differ in many ways as well. The articles presented in this issue of Psychiatry Research are a result of this international collaboration, which examined diagnostic and classification issues of OCSDs for DSM-V in a conference titled  The Future of Psychiatric Diagnosis: Refining the Research Agenda: Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior Spectrum  held in June 2006 at the American Psychiatric Association's headquarters in Arlington, VA.",M1

A range of studies have subsequently allowed comparison of the phenomenology, psychobiology, and management of TS and TTM, with that of OCD. Here we briefly review this literature. The data indicate that there is significant psychobiological overlap between TS and OCD, supporting the idea that TS can be conceptualized as an OCD spectrum disorder. TTM and OCD have only partial overlap in their phenomenology and psychobiology, but there are a number of reasons for why it may be useful to classify TTM and other habit disorders as part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum of disorders.",M1
19800695,"Cognitive event-related potentials differentiate schizophrenia with obsessive-compulsive disorder (schizo-<e>OCD</e>) from OCD and schizophrenia without OC symptoms.Clinical and neurobiological evidence suggests that concurrent presentation of schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive (schizo-OCD) symptoms represents a distinct clinical entity. Given that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia have been modeled as having different neurofunctional profiles, the overlap between them represents a heuristic challenge for cognitive and endophenotype research. Event-related potentials (ERPs) may be used to probe neurophysiological correlates of the cognitive, emotional and behavioral disturbances found in neuropsychiatric entities such as schizo-OCD. Here we measure ERPs during a discriminative response task (DRT) in patients presenting with the DSM-IV criteria for both schizophrenia and OCD. We also performed these measurements in patients with OCD without psychotic features, as well as in patients with schizophrenia without OC symptoms. Schizo-OCD patients showed a distinct ERP pattern, with abnormally increased target activation (akin to OCD patients, but unlike the pattern observed in schizophrenic patients) and reduced P300 amplitudes (akin to schizophrenic patients, but unlike OCD patients). Similar to the control subjects, schizo-OCD patients showed larger amplitudes in the non-target condition than in the target condition. These results suggest that schizo-OCD may not only be a distinct clinical entity from pure OCD and schizophrenia, but it may also be characterized by a distinguishable neurophysiologic pattern. Neurobiological underpinnings deserve further considerations and might drive to a definition of a distinctive endophenotype for schizo-OCD in the de-construction of the schizophrenia endophenotype.",M1
19798760,"Are obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions familial in nonclinical individuals?BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (<e>OCD</e>) is a heterogeneous condition, which can be expressed as various potentially overlapping symptom dimensions. In clinical samples, some of these dimensions are associated with increased familial risk for OCD and appear to be familial (intercorrelated within pairs of affected family members), whereas others are not. The goal of this study was to determine whether obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions are familial in a nonclinical sample. METHODS: OC symptom dimensions and negative affect were assessed in 184 female undergraduate students and their parents using the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scales, respectively. Bivariate correlations and multiple regression models controlling for age and negative affect were employed to examine the familiarity of OC symptom dimensions. RESULTS: The OCI-R total scores were significantly correlated in both mother-daughter and father-daughter dyads but the magnitude of these correlations tended to be greater for the mother-daughter dyads. Multiple regression models showed that the Ordering and Hoarding subscales of the OCI-R breed true in mother-daughter dyads. Ordering scores in mothers were also predictive of other symptoms in the daughters (Washing and Checking). CONCLUSIONS: These results are broadly consistent with the findings in clinical samples and suggest that Ordering and Hoarding are more strongly familial than other symptom dimensions and that high Ordering scores in mothers are associated with increased levels of symptoms in daughters in a less specific manner.",M1

Radiography showed features consistent with unilateral osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the lateral femoral condyle in the right stifle. Arthroscopic examination of the stifle was used to confirm the presence of an articular cartilage lesion and the presence of loose cartilage within the joint. The loose cartilage fragments were removed arthroscopically. One arthroscopy portal was extended into a limited arthrotomy, which was necessary to ensure complete debridement of the defect.

20104156,"A prospective, randomized clinical study of osteochondral autologous transplantation versus microfracture for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans in the knee joint in children.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of the arthroscopic mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) and microfracture (MF) procedures for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) defects of the femoral condyles of the knee joint in children under the age of 18 years. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective, randomized clinical study. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 50 children with a mean age of 14.3 years (12 to 18) and with symptomatic lesions of the OCD in the femoral condyle of the knee were randomized to undergo either the OAT or the MF procedure. Only those children with grade 3 or 4 (OCD) in the medial or lateral femoral condyle (according to International Cartilage Repair Society, ICRS) were included in the study. Forty-seven patients (94%) were available for follow-up. There were 25 patients in the OAT group and 22 patients in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 23.54+/-4.24 months and the mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y), and none of the children had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Children were evaluated using ICRS score, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and second-look arthroscopies. RESULTS: After 1 year, both groups had significant clinical improvement (P&lt;0.05) and the ICRS functional and objective assessment showed that 23 of 25 (92%) patients had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 19 of 22 (86%) after MF (NS), but 19 of 23 (83%) after OAT and only 12 of 19 (63%) after MF procedure maintained excellent or good results after 4.2 years (range from 3 to 6 y). The MF group showed significant deterioration over the 4.2 years follow-up (P&lt;0.05), but still had significant clinical improvement compared with pretreatment evaluation (P=0.004). There were 9 of 22 (41%) failures in the MF group, and none in the OAT group. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation according to the ICRS evaluation system showed excellent or good repairs in 19 of 21 patients (91%) after OAT compared with 10 of 18 (56%) after MF. CONCLUSIONS: At an average of 4.2 years follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in children under the age of 18 years has shown significant superiority of the mosaic-type OAT over MF for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans defects in the knee. However, our study has shown that both MF and OAT give encouraging clinical results for children under the age of 18 years. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1: randomized controlled trial, significant difference.",M2
20043780,"Association between clinical signs and histopathologic changes in the synovium of the tarsocrural joint of horses with osteochondritis dissecans of the tibia.OBJECTIVE: To develop a scoring system for histopathologic changes in the synovium of tarsocrural joints (TCJs) of horses with osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) and to test for association between histopathologic changes and joint effusion or lameness. ANIMALS: 93 horses with OCD of the intermediate ridge of the tibia of 1 or both TCJs (134 joints) and 38 control horses without disease of TCJs (38 joints). PROCEDURES: For OCD-affected horses, pretreatment lameness, TCJ effusion, and results of pelvic limb flexion test were scored. Synovial biopsy specimens were obtained from TCJs of OCD-affected horses during arthroscopy, and similar postmortem tissue specimens were obtained from control horses through a small arthrotomy. Histologic signs of synovitis in 172 biopsy specimens were scored by 2 pathologists (A and B) by use of 2 criteria: synoviocyte proliferation and cellular infiltration. RESULTS: Analysis of scoring revealed good to very good intraobserver agreement within pathologist A (weighted kappa [WK], 0.76 to 0.81), and moderate to good agreement within pathologist B (WK, 0.56 to 0.63). Interobserver agreement for synoviocyte proliferation (WK, 0.34 to 0.52) and cellular infiltration (WK, 0.38 to 0.48) scores was fair to moderate. Joint effusion and synoviocyte proliferation were significantly associated, as were joint effusion and cellular infiltration. There was no association between histopathologic changes and the other clinical signs evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The scoring system was helpful for evaluating synovial inflammation caused by OCD of the intermediate ridge of the tibia in horses. Histopathologic signs of synovial inflammation were associated with effusion but not with lameness.",M2
20032736,"Fixation of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee using poly 96L/4D-lactide copolymer bioabsorbable implants.BACKGROUND: The fixation of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) lesions has been described using metal implants, staples, bone pegs, and bioabsorbable implants. Bioabsorbable fixation has potential benefits including not requiring a second surgery for implant removal, no interference on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and a potentially lower incidence of prominent hardware. The possible complications of bioabsorbable fixation include synovitis, loss of fixation owing to noncompressive properties, and sterile abscess formation. The results of bioabsorbable fixation of juvenile OCD lesions of the knee have not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bioabsorbable copolymer fixation in the management of unstable OCD lesions of the knee in adolescents. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of patients with unstable OCD lesions of the knee that were treated with poly 96L/4D-lactide copolymer bioabsorable implants. Information was gathered through 3 standardized and validated knee-function questionnaires, participants' medical records, plain films, MRIs, and pain level and satisfaction scale questionnaires. RESULTS: Twenty-four knees in 24 patients were evaluated. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.4 years. The mean follow-up was 39.6 months. The mean International Knee Documentation Committee score at follow-up was 84.9, the mean Lysholm score was 88.0, and the mean Tegner score was 7.9. Plain films at an average of 19.2 months postoperatively revealed interval healing in 9 patients, no significant change in 1 patient, complete healing in 13 patients, and loose bodies with no interval healing in 1 patient. MRIs were obtained postoperatively in 17 knees, with a mean follow-up of 22.4 months. Interval healing was present in 16 of 17 MRIs, consistent with the plain film findings. Twenty-two of 24 patients had good-to-excellent outcomes. CONCLUSION: Poly 96L/4D-lactide copolymer bioabsorable implants seem to be safe and effective for the management of unstable juvenile OCD lesions of the knee. They offer stability for the healing OCD lesions, with minimal reaction from degradation products.",M2
20032735,"Arthroscopic management of osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum: mid-term results in adolescent athletes.BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the capitellum in adolescent athletes remains challenging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mid-term results of arthroscopic treatment of OCD of the capitellum in a series of adolescents. METHODS: We identified 25 consecutive patients at our institution that underwent arthroscopic treatment for OCD of the capitellum since 1999. Ten elbows were treated by arthroscopic debridement and drilling alone, whereas 12 elbows required additional mini-arthrotomies for bone grafting or the removal of large loose bodies after arthroscopy. The clinical charts and operative reports of these patients were retrospectively reviewed for relevant clinical information including age, sport, character of symptoms, preoperative and postoperative range of motion, return to sport, and postoperative complications. Twenty-one patients (22 elbows) were reached to determine their current elbow function and athletic activity using the Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation score. RESULTS: The average age of the patients in our series was 13.1 years. All patients participated in organized athletics that involved the upper extremity and had undergone an average of 10.2 months of nonoperative treatment before surgery. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, the patients gained an average of 17 degrees of extension and 10 degrees of flexion after surgery. Both the improvement in flexion and extension were statistically significant compared with the preoperative range of motions (P=0.001, P=0.01). When patients were asked to rate their elbow function from 0% to 100% using the Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation score, the average rating was 87%. Eighteen of 21 patients (86%) returned to participate in their sport at their preinjury level. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic management of capitellar OCD in adolescent athletes results in significantly improved range of motion and a high rate of return to athletics. Accompanying arthrotomy may be required for large loose body removal or bone grafting.",M2

19927588,"Comparison of radiography and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of osteochondritis dissecans in the equine femoropatellar joint.REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) lesions of the femoropatellar (FP) joint are diagnosed routinely by radiography, but lesions located in the trochlear groove or without accompanying subchondral bone changes can be difficult to visualise. Ultrasonography allows evaluation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone in the FPjoint. OBJECTIVES: To document the radiographic and ultrasonographic appearance of OCD lesions in the equine FP joint, grade ultrasonographic lesions and compare their accuracy in the diagnosis of these lesions. METHODS: The medical records of all horses diagnosed with FP OCD between 1995 and 2006 were assessed. Inclusion criteria included availability of both radiographic and ultrasonographic images. Lesion characteristics were evaluated in each trochlear ridge and trochlear groove. For assessment of the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of both imaging techniques in the diagnosis of OCD, only cases with an arthroscopic or necropsy examination were studied. RESULTS: Twenty-one horses were included. OCD lesions were diagnosed by radiography (30/32 joints) and ultrasound (32/32 joints). The lateral trochlear ridge (LTR, 91%) and the medial trochlear ridge (MTR, 17%) were involved on radiography. The localisation on ultrasound examination was similar (97% LTR, 25% MTR). All but one lesion seen on radiography were also detected with ultrasound; 2 LTR and 3 MTR lesions, not seen on radiography were diagnosed by ultrasound and confirmed at arthroscopy or necropsy. The specificity was 100% regardless of the site and imaging procedure except for the distal third of the MTR (94% for ultrasound). The sensitivity varied, depending on lesion site. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool to diagnose OCD lesions in the FP joint and more sensitive than radiography for lesions affecting the MTR of the distal femur. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ultrasound should be considered as a useful adjunct to radiography for diagnosing equine FP OCD, especially in cases of high clinical suspicion but equivocal radiographic findings. Images can be generated immediately when digital radiography is not available, permitting an immediate on-site diagnosis.",M2

Possible causes of osteochondrosis dissecans include (repetitive) trauma (e.g. in throwing sports or gymnastics), ischemia, ossification defects, and genetic factors. Conventional radiography mostly has a low sensitivity to detect OCD lesions, and is often normal in early stages. CT is more sensitive to detect intra-articular loose bodies.

19726624,"Sequential alterations in magnetic resonance imaging findings after autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty for young athletes with osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum.BACKGROUND: The goal of osteochondral mosaicplasty (mosaicplasty) against osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum (capitellar <e>OCD</e>) is to allow patients to return to their sports activities without functional disturbance of the affected elbow. Consequently, the rehabilitation protocol and the interval before returning to sports activities must be established. Although surgeons need this type of data for establishing sequential alterations of grafts in the elbow, no such data have been published. HYPOTHESIS: The findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improve with increasing time after mosaicplasty for capitellar OCD. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Ten young male athletes with advanced lesions of capitellar OCD, treated with mosaicplasties, underwent MRI scans at 3, 6, and 12 months, postoperatively. The surgical technique involved obtaining small-sized cylindrical osteochondral grafts from the lateral periphery of the femoral condyle at the level of the patellofemoral joint and transplanting them to the capitellar lesion. The MRI findings were semiquantitatively assessed according to the scoring system of Henderson et al (4, normal; 16, no repair). RESULTS: At 12 months, all patients returned to their competitive level of sports without any disturbances of the operated elbow. Fluid surrounding the graft was found in all patients at 3 months and 4 patients at 6 months. The grafts were all well seated within the recipient sites, with no MRI evidence of graft loosening at 12 months. The overall MRI scores significantly improved from 3 to 12 months. CONCLUSION: The MRI findings indicate that the graft incorporation to the surrounding tissues occurs around or after 6 months, postoperatively. This finding suggests that rehabilitation precautions be taken for up to 6 months after mosaicplasty for young athletes with capitellar OCD.",M2

Shock wave is a longitudinal acoustic wave traveling with the speed of ultrasound through the water of the body tissue. Recently, this therapy has been used in the treatment of a number of musculoskeletal pathologies on the basis of the effects produced by the induction of angiogenesis, recruitment of progenitor cells and downregulation of cartilage damage. This therapy is useful, because it is non-invasive, safe, without complications or adverse effects and repeatable. Thus, it could be suggested as a useful strategy for the treatment of OCD prior starting surgery.",M2
19556146,"Surgical treatment for osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum.BACKGROUND: Surgical treatments have been selected to treat advanced osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the humeral capitellum. PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical results of surgical treatments for advanced capitellar OCD lesion and to clarify problems of poor clinical results. METHODS: Cases were reviewed for 27 patients with advanced OCD lesions treated operatively. All patients were male baseball players, with a mean of 13.3 years at the time of surgery. Drilling only was performed for 3 patients, fragment fixation for 13 patients, and removal of the detached fragment with drilling for four patients. Since 2004, reconstruction of the articular surface with use of osteochondral autograft from the rib has been performed for 7 patients with osteochondral defect. Mean follow-up was 37.4 months. Follow-up assessment included modified elbow rating system, evaluation of radiographs, and return to sports. RESULTS: Mean subjective score improved significantly from 70 to 96 postoperatively. Mean objective score improved significantly 71 to 81 postoperatively. A postoperative return to baseball was achieved by 25 patients. On the final radiographs, 4 patients showed flattening of &gt;70% of the capitellum or degenerative changes, including insufficient remodeling of the lateral margin of the capitellum. Although patients could return to baseball, postoperative total arc of the elbow was decreased compared with the preoperative total arc. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatments were useful to restore advanced OCD lesions. Our results suggest that reconstruction of the lateral margin of the capitellum is important for achieving good clinical results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.",M2

METHODS: From January 2004 to May 2007, 13 patients with OCD with large osteochondral defects were treated. There were 7 males and 6 females, aged 18-59 years with an average of 35.8 years. The locations were left side in 8 cases and right side in 5 cases. The disease course was 7 days to 20 years with the median duration of 42 months. Four cases had obvious sprained history. The involved locations were lateral portion of the medial femur condyle (MFC) in 5 cases, trochlea area of MFC in 2 cases and lateral femur condyle in 6 cases. The range of motion was (95.0 +/- 13.5) degrees and the Lysholm score was 62.23 +/- 7.79. According to International Cartilage Repair Society classification system and the Guhl classification of OCD under arthroscopy, all the patients were type IV. Defect areas were 3-7 cm2 with an average of 4.32 cm2. The depths of defects were 0.8-2.0 cm with an average of 1.55 cm. Allograft osteochondral transplantation combining with adsorbable screw was applied for the lesions. The patients were closely instructed to do exercise through following up. RESULTS: The wounds all healed by first intention. Thirteen cases were followed up for 2.2 years (14 months to 4 years) after operation. Three months after operation, 2 cases had pain after continuous exercise for 1 hour, they were directed in the methods of functional exercise and to strengthen their quadriceps femoris. Medicine was given in 2 patients who had sign of friction feeling of joint 6 months after operation. The range of motion at the last follow-up was (137.0 +/- 9.8) degrees, showing statistically significant difference when compared with that before operation (P &lt; 0.05). The X-rays and EMRI examinations at following-up indicated that bone healed well and articular facet was integrity. The Lysholm score was 92.08 +/- 7.64 one year after operation, showing statistically significant difference when compared with that before operation (P &lt; 0.05).

19304740,"The candidate gene XIRP2 at a quantitative gene locus on equine chromosome 18 associated with osteochondrosis in fetlock and hock joints of South German Coldblood horses.A whole-genome scan for radiological signs of osteochondrosis (OC) and osteochondrosis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) in South German Coldblood (SGC) horses using 250 microsatellite markers identified a genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for fetlock OCD and a chromosome-wide QTL for hock OC on Equus caballus chromosome (ECA) 18 at a relative position of 45.9-78.2 cM. The aim of this study was to analyze associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes for OC in this QTL region using 96 SGC horses. The OC-QTL on ECA18 could be confirmed and narrowed down to an interval of 13 Mb between GALNT13 and Xin actin-binding repeat containing 2 (XIRP2). SNPs in the XIRP2 gene were significantly associated with fetlock OC, fetlock OCD, and hock OC. The significant associations of SNPs in XIRP2 could be confirmed in linear animal models controlling for systematic environmental and residual quantitative genetic effects. The significant additive genetic effects of the intronic SNPs (AJ885515:g.159A&gt;G, AJ885515:g.445T&gt;C) in XIRP2 were 0.15 (P = 0.01) for fetlock OC, 0.27 (P = 0.01) for fetlock OCD, and 0.15-0.16 (P = 0.01-0.02) for hock OC. Homozygous (A/A or T/T) and heterozygous horses were at a 1.3- to 2.4-fold higher risk for fetlock and hock OC. These results suggest that dominant variants of XIRP2 may be involved in pathogenesis of equine OC.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: Dogs (n=27) with medial humeral condylar OCD. METHODS: After arthroscopic assessment, the medial humeral condyle was exposed by arthrotomy. Medial coronoid disease (MCD) was managed by subtotal coronoid ostectomy, then the OCD lesion debrided and OATS instrumentation used for resurfacing the defect with osteochondral core grafts collected from the stifle. Recipient sockets were created to maximally resurface OCD lesions. Six elbows also had proximal ulnar osteotomy. Outcomes measures included subjective clinical, radiographic, and arthroscopic examination at 12-18 weeks. RESULTS: Of 33 treated elbows, 30 also had MCD. Accurate reconstruction of the medial humeral condylar surface was achieved in all joints. Lameness resolved in 3-13 weeks in 26 of 31 limbs with follow-up. Arthroscopic outcomes for elbows with concomitant MCD but without proximal ulnar osteotomy were variable (14/24 good, 5/24 intermediate, 5/24 poor). Short-term outcome for OCD without MCD (n=2) and when proximal ulnar osteotomy (n=5) was performed were positive. Long-term assessments of 7 dogs suggested minimal donor site morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: OAT procedures are technically feasible in the canine elbow. In elbows with concurrent MCD, proximal ulnar osteotomy may improve likelihood of positive clinical outcome. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: OAT procedures warrant further evaluation as a treatment option for selected cases of OCD involving the canine medial humeral condyle.",M2
19204369,"Does operative fixation of an osteochondritis dissecans loose body result in healing and long-term maintenance of knee function?BACKGROUND: Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) can progress to loose body formation, resulting in a grade IV defect. The decision to fix versus excise the loose body is controversial. Published operative fixation outcomes are small case series with short follow-up. HYPOTHESIS: Operative fixation (ORIF) of the loose body into the grade IV defect will heal and approximate  normal  knee function at long-term follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Twelve patients were identified who underwent ORIF of a knee OCD loose body into the grade IV osteochondral defects ranging in size from 2.0 to 8.0 cm(2) (mean, 3.5 cm(2)). After 12 weeks, hardware was removed, and healing was assessed. Long-term outcomes were assessed with a Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and a Marx activity score. RESULTS: Arthroscopy for screw removal revealed stable healing in 92% (11 of 12) of patients. No patients required subsequent surgery for a loose body. At an average of 9.2 years' follow-up (range, 3.8-15.8 years), 83% (10 of 12) of patients completed the KOOS. The KOOS subscale scores for pain (mean, 87.8; range, 67-100), other symptoms (mean, 81.8; range, 61-96), function in activities of daily living (mean, 93.1; range, 72-100), and sports and recreation function (mean, 74.0; range, 40-100) were not significantly lower than those of published age-matched controls. However the KOOS subscale score for knee-related quality of life (mean, 61.9; range, 31-88) was significantly lower (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Operative fixation of grade IV OCD loose bodies results in stable fixation. At an average 9 years after surgery, patients did not have symptoms of osteoarthritis pain and had normal function in activities of daily life. However, patients reported significantly lower knee-related quality of life. Operative fixation of OCD loose bodies is a better alternative to lesion excision.",M2

We report our initial results with this treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen subjects aged 18 to 60 treated for OCD of the talus were followed for 26 weeks, in a pre- and post-treatment repeated measurements design, after receiving three weekly injections of intra-articular HA. The efficacy of HA injections in reducing pain and improving function was assessed at each visit and adverse events were recorded. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing scores determined using a Visual Analog Scale for pain, stiffness and function over time with baseline values. In addition, frequency of symptoms and global function over time were assessed using questionnaires and the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale. Data analysis was made using ANCOVA models and paired t-tests. All statistical tests were based on an alpha level of 0.05. RESULTS: The majority of subjects were male (60%) and had Grade 3 lesions (60%). Mean VAS scores, reported on a scale from 1 (e.g., no pain) to 10 (e.g., worst pain) decreased for pain (5.6 to 3.2), stiffness (5.1 to 2.9), and function (5.9 to 3.3) from baseline to week 26. Subjective global function scores, reported on a scale from 0 to 100 (with 100 representing healthy, pre-injury function), improved on average from 57.3 at baseline to 74.3 by week 26. All of these results were statistically significant, as was the decrease in frequency of pain reported by subjects at the end of the study. CONCLUSION: OCD of the ankle treated with intra-articular injections of HA caused a decrease in pain scores and increase in global functioning over a short period of time (within 12 weeks) which then lasted for more than 6 months with minimal adverse events.",M2

18180593,"[Osteochondritis dissecans]Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) is a disease of unknown etiology, characterized by separation of necrotic bone from its bony bed. While the juvenile form seen in patients with open physes has a 60-90% rate of spontaneous resolution, the adult form has virtually no chance of spontaneous healing. Plain X-rays are sufficient for the diagnosis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for evaluation of disease progression and/or healing. The clinical correlation of MRI criteria defined in recent years to determine stability of the lesion is high. Juvenile OCD can be treated conservatively if there are no signs of instability on magnetic resonance images. Adult patients or unstable lesions in children should be treated surgically. For stable lesions, arthroscopic antegrade perforation is indicated to increase vascularity and stimulate healing. Unstable or displaced lesions should be treated with debridement, internal fixation, and cancellous bone grafting. Although cannulated metal screws are the most widely used implants for internal fixation, biodegradable implants have also been utilized in recent years. Loose fragments that are too deformed to be internally fixed should be removed and cartilage reconstruction techniques should be employed for the remaining crater. Long-term results of loose body removal alone are unsatisfactory. Modern cartilage restoration techniques are technically demanding due to the large, deep, and unconfined nature of the defect in the femoral condyle.",M2
18836700,"Oblique osteochondral plugs transplantation technique for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow joint.Autologous osteochondral transplantation is an established surgical procedure for osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the knee, and has recently been applied in cases of advanced-staged OCD of the elbow. The elbow procedure; however, is more technically demanding than for the knee. One reason is the difficulties of perpendicular insertion of large-diameter osteochondral plugs to the humeral capitellum with a small, narrow operative field in the humeroradial joint. Furthermore, if the OCD lesion is located on the lateral site of the capitellum, the creation of recipient holes perpendicular to the joint surface is difficult due to the risk of damaging the lateral wall of the capitellum. To avoid such difficulties, we developed a new technique by which 6.5 and/or 8.5 mm diameter plugs are harvested from the ipsilateral knee, having an oblique cartilage surface relative to the long axis of the plugs. These are then inserted into the recipient holes which are created obliquely from the lateral and distal to medial and proximal directions in the capitellum at an angle complimentary to the harvested plugs. This technique allows easy insertion of large-diameter plugs into recipient holes in a restricted operative field, even if the OCD lesion is located in the lateral site.",M2
18552309,"Juvenile versus adult osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: appropriate MR imaging criteria for instability.PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare the sensitivity and specificity of previously described magnetic resonance (MR) imaging criteria for the detection of instability in patients with juvenile or adult osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the knee, with arthroscopic findings as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board for this HIPAA-compliant study. The study group consisted of 32 skeletally immature patients (25 boys, seven girls; mean age, 14.4 years) with 36 juvenile OCD lesions of the knee and 33 skeletally mature patients (25 men, eight women; mean age, 26.2 years) with 34 adult OCD lesions of the knee. All patients had been evaluated with MR imaging and arthroscopy. MR studies were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists in consensus to determine the presence of previously described MR imaging criteria for OCD instability (ie, high T2 signal intensity rim, surrounding cysts, high T2 signal intensity cartilage fracture line, and fluid-filled osteochondral defect). Sensitivity and specificity of the criteria were calculated separately for juvenile and adult OCD lesions. RESULTS: Separately, previously described MR imaging criteria for detection of OCD instability were 0%-88% sensitive and 21%-100% specific for juvenile OCD lesions and 27%-54% sensitive and 100% specific for adult OCD lesions. When used together, the criteria were 100% sensitive and 11% specific for instability in juvenile OCD lesions and 100% sensitive and 100% specific for instability in adult OCD lesions. CONCLUSION: Previously described MR imaging criteria for OCD instability have high specificity for adult but not juvenile lesions of the knee.",M2

18509814,"Clinical outcome of fragment fixation for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow.BACKGROUND: The choice of surgical or non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the humeral capitellum is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of fragment fixation for OCD of the humeral capitellum. METHODS: We reviewed 28 patients with OCD of the humeral capitellum after a mean follow up of 17 months. All patients were men and mean age was 14 years. Twenty-seven patients had a history of repetitive overuse of the elbow with baseball pitching, one with tennis. Mean duration of overuse of the elbow was four years. All patients had elbow pain and difficulty in throwing, with a mean duration of symptoms for 17 months. The mean arc of flexion before surgery ranged from 11 degrees to 126 degrees. Radiographs of the elbow showed a radiolucent cystic area of the humeral capitellum in one patient, a non-displaced split type fragment in 12 patients, and a slightly displaced split type fragment in 15 patients. Fragment fixation surgery was performed in all patients by lateral arthrotomy including drilling and fixation of the fragment with a double wiring technique using flexible wire or thread under direct vision. Sport activities using upper extremities were restricted for four to six months until the lesion healed in radiograph. RESULTS: Post-operatively, 25 patients had no pain and three decreased pain. Average arc of flexion was one to 132 degrees, an improvement of 16 degrees compared with the pre-operative arc. Radiographic findings showed complete healing of the lesion in 11 patients, partial healing in 12, unchanged in three, and loose body formation in two. By Tivnon's evaluation of the elbow function, results were excellent in 19 patients, good in five, fair in two, and poor in two. The ratio of complete or partial healing of the lesion was 100 percent in 16 patients in whom the thickness of the lesion was less than 9 mm on pre-operative radiograph, and 58 percent in 12 patients in whom the lesion thickness was 9 mm or more, which showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fragment fixation for OCD of the humeral capitellum was effective in patients whose lesion thickness was less than 9 mm. Fixation by flexible wire or thread and revascularization by drilling for the fragment were considered to be insufficient for large lesions with a thickness of 9 mm or more.",M2
18500061,"Evaluation and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee.Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) is a condition affecting the subchondral bone of joints with secondary effects on articular cartilage that results in pain, effusions, loose-body formation, and mechanical symptoms. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns. This article discusses the etiology of knee OCD lesions, clinical presentation, proper evaluation, and treatment options. Treatment of OCD may include nonoperative measures or operative procedures ranging from drilling or fixation of fragments to complex reconstruction procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft, and fresh osteochondral allograft. Physicians must consider many factors, including the patient's age and skeletal maturity, as well as size, location, and stability of OCD lesions to determine the proper course of treatment.",M2
18324579,"[Clinical results after three years use of matrix-associated ACT for the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee]AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical results after the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). METHOD: In this study 13 patients with osteochondral defects of the knee (12 femoral, 1 tibial) with <e>OCD</e> ICRS grade IV or ICRS grade IV B were included. The osteochondral defects were reconstructed simultaneously with autologous monocortical cancellous bone cylinders or chips from cancellous bone and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (CaReS). Data were analysed in accordance with the ICRS criteria and the Brittberg score. Patients were followed up to 36 months after the operation. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 34.9 (16 - 47) years at the time of surgery. The size of the defect was 8.1 (3.8 - 13.5) cm(2). The subjective and objective IKDC scores, the Brittberg and the ICRS function score were statistically significantly improved during the observation time. In one patient the transplantation failed and another patient was not available for the follow-up at 36 months. The objective IKDC score and the ICRS function score increased from 0/13 (0 %) to 11/12 (91.7 %) in categories A and B, or I and II, respectively, after 3 years. At this point of time 83.4 % (10/12) of the patients voted the treatment as excellent or good. The subjective IKDC score improved from 38.4 (+/- 12.7) preoperatively to 66.1 (+/- 17.0) after 3 years. CONCLUSION: The treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation shows promising results even for larger defects. But for a final decision about this therapy the present sample size was too small. There is a need for further long-term investigation with a larger number of patients.",M2

The patients presented with recurrent episodes of pain and swelling, but these were initially thought to be 'growing pains'. Eventually, a delayed diagnosis of bicondylar OCD was established and both patients were referred for further management. After assessing the extent of the disease on MRI, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation was performed to treat the defects of the lateral condyle in each case, with a plan to address the medial defects at a later stage. Proposed theories on the aetiology of the condition and available methods of treatment are discussed. A diagnosis of OCD should be considered in young patients with persistent knee pain and effusions, and MRI is the investigation of choice for early detection.",M2
18237711,"A new arthroscopic-assisted drilling method through the radius in a distal-to-proximal direction for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow.We developed a new arthroscopic-assisted drilling method through the radius in a distal-to-proximal direction for osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the elbow. Only 1 drill hole is created in the radius by use of a single 1.8-mm K-wire inserted from the shaft of the radius approximately 3 cm distal to the humeroradial joint into the joint, which allows drilling of the entire OCD lesion. The forearm is supinated so that the tip of the K-wire is at the lateral side of the lesion in the humeral capitellum, and drilling is performed at 30 degrees elbow flexion. The flexion angle is changed from 30 degrees to 60 degrees to 90 degrees to 120 degrees while maintaining supination, to drill in 4 sites (1 site for each angle of flexion) of the lateral side of the OCD lesion. Next, we move the forearm from supination to pronation so that the tip of the K-wire is placed in the medial side of the lesion in the humeral capitellum, and as with the lateral side, drilling is performed in 4 sites. With this technique, the entire OCD lesion can be vertically drilled under arthroscopic guidance. This method is minimally invasive, and an early return to sports could be possible.",M2

DESIGN: We identified a five-generation family with 15 living affected members from Northern Sweden. The disorder was diagnosed with a case definition of OCD in at least one joint. RESULTS: Main clinical findings consisted of OCD in knees and/or hips and/or elbows, disproportionate short stature and early osteoarthritis (OA). There were no radiological indications of epiphyseal dysplasia. Anthropometric measurements of affected individuals showed short stature, a high ratio between sitting height and total height, a relatively normal arm span and head circumference. In 12 of 15 cases, onset was during late childhood or adolescence and OA had developed in seven of those patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggests that OA is a frequent complication in familial OCD even though the lesions appear before closure of physis.",M2

18038231,"Fixation with autogenous osteochondral grafts for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (stages III and IV).This paper presents a clinical and functional assessment of the cases of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) treated with small mosaicplasty type osteochondral grafts. Between 1999 and 2004, we operated on 12 knees with OCD stages III and IV. They were assessed using the International Cartilage Research Society (ICRS) scale, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale, X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study was carried out using a clinical series, was retrospective and had a level of evidence of 4. Before surgery, all patients were in classes III and IV on the ICRS scale (four in class III and eight in class IV). At the time of surgery, the patient age was 27.5 +/- 7.9 years, with male predominance (75%). Eleven of the cases were assessed as classes I and II on the ICRS scale (seven in class I and four in class II), with one patient in class IV. X-ray assessment was less favourable, revealing alterations in the articular space in 75% of cases. The results show that this technique enables the biological fixation of fragments and, functionally, the clinical results obtained were very good. The osteochondral grafts avoid the implantation of foreign material and make use of bone fragments of the same rigidity as the OCD fragment. We conclude that the technique described is an excellent alternative to the techniques normally used for the fixation of stage III and IV OCD.",M2
17985146,"Bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle following bilateral total removal of lateral discoid meniscus: a case report.Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the lateral femoral condyle sometimes occurs with a discoid lateral meniscus. Recently, it was reported that OCD of the lateral femoral condyle occurred after total removal of the lateral meniscus. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy with bilateral OCD of the lateral femoral condyle following bilateral total removal for discoid lateral meniscus. Valgus deviation of the knee after total removal and increased sporting activity might have concentrated excessive stress on the lateral condyles in the standing position. As a result, bilateral OCD might have occurred. Drilling of the areas of OCD on the bilateral lateral femoral condyles was done and the patient wore inner wedge arch supports postoperatively. After 2 years, neither knee pain nor arthrosis has occurred so far, but long-term follow-up of this patient is considered to be necessary.",M2

17694305,"Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of osteochondritis dissecans of the patella.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of patellar osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed MR images of 16 patients (18 cases, mean age 20 years) using OCD of the patella. In 5 cases surgery was carried out, and we compared the surgical findings with the MR imaging findings in these cases. RESULTS: In all 18 cases, OCD was located central-inferiorly on the patella, and the average size was 11 x 11 x 7 mm. Subchondral deformities were present in 16 out of 18 cases (88.9%), subchondral cyst formation in 4 cases (22.2%), reactive bone marrow signal in 8 cases (44.4%), overlying patellar cartilage abnormality in 14 cases (77.8%), loose body in 2 cases (11.1%), patella alta in 8 cases (44.4%), hypoplastic sulcus in 7 cases (38.9%), and synovitis in 4 cases (22.2%). In all 5 cases in which surgery was carried out, the cartilage abnormality classified on the MR images was confirmed, and a loose body was removed at arthroscopy in 2 of the 5 cases. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging of patellar OCD typically shows subchondral deformity and variable abnormalities of the overlying patellar cartilage located central-inferiorly on the patella.",M2
17681206,"Fixation of unstable osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee using arthroscopic autogenous osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty).PURPOSE: A number of surgical techniques have been described for the operative fixation of an unstable osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) lesion in the knee that has failed appropriate nonoperative management. However, no one technique has been universally successful. We report the results of a new fixation technique for unstable OCD lesions using arthroscopic autogenous osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty). METHODS: Twenty patients with OCD lesions (16 International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] OCD type II, 3 ICRS OCD type III, and 1 ICRS OCD type IV) who had failed an appropriate course of nonoperative management underwent autogenous osteochondral grafting. The OCD lesions were assessed arthroscopically and then fixed in situ by using multiple 4.5-mm osteochondral dowel grafts harvested from the edges of the femoral trochlea. The lesion was initially fixed with an osteochondral graft passing through the center of the fragment and then stabilized by using further grafts inserted around its periphery. RESULTS: Preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee scores assessed 5 patients as nearly normal, 8 as abnormal, and 7 as severely abnormal. At the 18-month follow-up, all of the knees were scored as normal. The average preoperative visual analog pain score out of 10 was 8.3, which was reduced to 0.8 at 6 months and to 0 at 1 year after surgery. Serial magnetic resonance imaging scans showed healing of the bony part of the lesion in all of the knees 6 months after surgery and continuous articular cartilage healing at 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Autogenous osteochondral grafting of unstable OCD lesions in the knee is a reliable and minimally invasive technique that provides a stable biologic fixation using autogenous bone graft and has few complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.",M2
17637421,"Retroarticular drilling and bone grafting of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the knee.We present an effective technique for retroarticular drilling and bone grafting of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>). A radiolucent bolster is used to flex the knee at 45 degrees, allowing adequate C-arm visualization. A 2-cm incision is made over the iliac spine, and soft tissue is dissected with the use of electrocautery. A 3.5-mm Steinmann pin is driven approximately 5 cm into the iliac crest. With a mallet, the 3.5-mm-long drill sleeve from the Synthes External Fixator Set (Part #395.913; Synthes, Paoli, PA) is tamped over and 1 cm past the guide pin, while cores of autograft cancellous bone are harvested. The same Steinmann pin is inserted over the corresponding aspect of the knee. The Steinmann pin is advanced to approximately 1 cm above the lesion, and the drill guide is once again tapped over the pin. With use of the C-arm, the pin is removed, and a 3.5-mm bit is used to drill the remaining distance into the lesion. The graft is tamped through the drill guide and into position with the reverse end of the bit. This technique may be repeated according to the size of the lesion. Major advantages of this technique include the ease of harvest/transfer of autograft, readily available instrumentation to perform the procedure, and the ability to avoid violation of stable articular cartilage.",M2

METHODS: Six patients (mean age 20.2 +/- 8.8 years; 13-35 years) who underwent ACI for full-thickness cartilage defects of the femoral condyle were studied. One year after the procedure, a second-look arthroscopic operation was performed with biopsy of reparative tissue. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) visual histological assessment scale was used for histological assessment. Biopsied tissue was immunohistochemically analyzed with the use of monoclonal antihuman collagen type I and monoclonal antihuman collagen type II primary antibodies. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentrations in biopsied reparative cartilage samples were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MR imaging was performed with T1- and T2-weighted imaging and three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled (3D-SPGR) MR imaging. RESULTS: Four tissue samples were graded as having a mixed morphology of hyaline and fibrocartilage while the other two were graded as fibrocartilage. Average ICRS scores for each criterion were (I) 1.0 +/- 1.5; (II) 1.7 +/- 0.5; (III) 0.6 +/- 1.0; (IV) 3.0 +/- 0.0; (V) 1.8 +/- 1.5; and (VI) 2.5 +/- 1.2. Average total score was 10.7 +/- 2.8. On immunohistochemical analysis, the matrix from deep and middle layers of reparative cartilage stained positive for type II collagen; however, the surface layer did not stain well. The average GAG concentration in reparative cartilage was 76.6 +/- 4.2 microg/mg whereas that in normal cartilage was 108 +/- 11.2 microg/mg. Common complications observed on 3D-SPGR MR imaging were hypertrophy of grafted periosteum, edema-like signal in bone marrow, and incomplete repair of subchondral bone at the surgical site. Clinically, patients had significant improvements in Lysholm scores. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a good clinical course, reparative cartilage after ACI had less GAG concentration and was inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in histological and immunohistochemical appearance and on MRI findings.",M2

METHOD: Between 2004 and 200622 patients with osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing zone of the femoral condyles(ICRS <e>OCD</e> III and IV) were reconstructed simultaneously with bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (NOVOCART 3D). All patients were analysed prospectively. RESULTS: 17 Males and 5 females(age 28.3, range: 17-49 years) were surgically treated with the above-mentioned novel method. Before reconstruction osteochondral defects had an average defect area of 4.8 (2.4-9.0) cm2 and a depth of between 4 and 15 mm. For reconstruction an average of 2.6 (1-6) monocortical cancellous bone cylinders (diameter 8mm) was used to fill the osseous defect and to reconstruct the subchondral bone plate with adequate positioning of the monocortical layer of the graft. Then a Matrix-ACT was used to cover the reconstructed subchondral bone plate. The average follow-up was 16 (6-36) months. The average Tegner activity score was 4 (3-7) of 10. The Lysholm-Gillquistscore and the Cincinnati Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center score were significantly improved postoperatively. The IKDC-2000 questionnaire was also significantly increased by 50%. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous reconstruction of deep osteochondral detects of the knee joint with bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation in osteochondritis dissecans is a biological, one-step alternative to previously reported methods with encouraging first results.",M2

All MTRT-OCD lesions were imaged by radiography and computed tomography (CT). The dimensions of subchondral bone lesions were measured (length, width and depth) using CT software. Similar to a method used in humans, the estimated volume (length x width x depth) and cross sectional area (length x width) were calculated and compared. We found that MTRT-OCD lesions causing visible lameness were significantly larger, and were associated with more joint thickening and degenerative joint disease than contralateral lesions that were not associated with any apparent lameness. As in the disease of shoulder osteochondritis dissecans, there is probably a correlation between the size of MTRT-OCD lesions and the symptoms of lameness.",M2
17222556,"Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee; long-term clinical outcome following arthroscopic debridement.We reviewed 32 knees in 26 patients who had previously undergone arthroscopic debridement for symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the knee. The patients were followed up at a minimum of 11 years following surgery and were evaluated clinically using the American Knee Society Clinical Rating Score. Additional evaluation was performed using the Hughston Scale to include radiographic assessment. The mean American Knee Society Score was 179 (out of 200), indicating good clinical function. Radiographically, however, only 29% scored excellent or good on the Hughston Scale. Younger patients with a small, stable (and therefore preserved), medial femoral condyle lesion had the best prognosis. Whilst more novel and complex options such as chondrocyte implantation are being assessed for the treatment of OCD, it is clear that within this study group careful debridement with removal of loose tissue can achieve good clinical results in the long term. There was however radiographic evidence of early degenerative joint disease in 17/24 (71%) of patients reviewed. Patients undergoing excision of OCD fragments did worse than those in whom the fragment was preserved, however the risk of further surgery is raised if a fragment is left in situ at initial surgery.",M2

An OCD model was designed using rigid polyurethane foam. Each specimen consisted of two components, an osteochondral fragment and a corresponding defect. A total of 40 specimens were prepared and assigned to one of four groups: control (no extrinsic stabilizer); two 2-mm-diameter Kirschner wires (K-wires), 40 mm in length; one threaded washer and a 28-mm screw; and one threaded washer and a 38 mm screw. Each specimen was mounted onto an Iosipescu shear test fixture and subjected to shear loads at a pseudo-static displacement rate of 0.075 mm/s. All groups demonstrated some stability; controls were significantly less stable than all other groups. The group with the threaded washer and 38-mm screw demonstrated the greatest stability (p &lt; 0.001), and no difference was noted between the K-wire and 28-mm screw groups. These results suggest that, in this OCD model, friction conferred some intrinsic stability to resist loads in shear. However, stability was improved with the use of long implants that compressed the fragments together.",M2

The prevalence of OC and OCD in fetlock and hock joints was analysed in 167 young coldblood horses with a mean age of 14 months. The presence of at least one osteochondrotic lesion (OC) in fetlock or hock joints was documented for 61.7% of the horses and 26.9% of the horses had osseus fragments. Osteochondrotic findings at the dorsal aspect of the sagittal ridge of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bone were seen in 53.9% of the horses and palmar/plantar osseous fragments in fetlock joints in 16.2% of the horses. Hock joint OC was found in 40.1% of the horses and hock OCD in 0.6%. Osteochondrotic findings in the distal part of the tibia were prevalent in 28.1% and in the lateral trochlea tali in 17.4% of the horses. The sex of the investigated horses significantly influenced the prevalence of OC in fetlock and hock joints, as well as the findings in the distal part of the tibia and lateral trochlea tali. Age at radiological examination was significant for the prevalence of OC in hock joints, palmar/plantar osseous fragments in fetlock joints and osteochondrotic findings in the distal part of the tibia. Female horses showed a 2-fold higher risk for OC in fetlock and hock joints than male horses. The distribution of the affected horses by age classes showed that radiographic signs of OC in fetlock and hock joints significantly increased at an age of about 1 year. We can conclude from our study that fetlock and hock OC is a prevalent radiographic finding in more than 1-year-old female and male SGC horses.",M2

In the present study, the extent of damage and repair on the articular cartilage and subchondral bone was examined histologically using specimens of 25 osteochondral cylinders and seven loose bodies obtained from 25 young athletes who had undergone osteochondral autograft surgery. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assays for detecting apoptotic cells and immunohistochemistry of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were performed on the osteochondral cylinder specimens. The histological findings of the OCD of the elbow showed that the articular cartilage exhibited degenerative change, mimicking osteoarthritis, and was markedly damaged as the lesion progressed. TUNEL-positive cells and MMP-3- and -13-expressing cells were distributed in the degenerative articular cartilage and reparative fibrocartilage tissue. Separation occurred at either the deep articular cartilage or the subchondral bone, with the former being dominant in the early OCD lesions. The present results suggest that the primary pathological changes in OCD of the elbow were due to damage of articular cartilage induced by repeated stress following degenerative and reparative process of articular cartilage and subchondral fracturing, and separation subsequently occurred on the cartilage and developed onto the subchondral bone in its advanced stages.",M2

The efficacy of intra-articular and i.v. use has been evaluated but the oral route has yet to be examined. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of oral hyaluronan gel on joint effusion following arthroscopic surgery for osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the tarsocrural joint of yearling Thoroughbreds. METHODS: Forty-eight yearlings diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral osteochondritis dessicans (OCD) of the tarsus were arbitrarily chosen prior to arthroscopic surgery. The yearlings were included only if they had mild or no synovial effusion pre-surgery. Twenty-four of the yearlings (27 joints) were treated with 100 mg of HA orally for 30 days post operatively and 24 (30 joints) with a placebo orally for 30 days. At 30 days post operation, a blinded examiner scored the effusion of the dorsomedial tarsocrural joint individually using a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = no effusion, 1 = barely palpable effusion, 2 = palpable effusion [without plantar effusion], 3 = golf ball sized effusion with plantar effusion, 4 = tennis ball sized effusion with plantar effusion, 5 = &gt; tennis ball sized effusion with plantar effusion). Half grades were allowed and OCD lesion sizes and locations were compared. RESULTS: A total of 57 joints were examined, of which 33 had OCD of the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia, 19 OCD of the distal lateral trochlear ridge of the talus and 5 OCD of the medial malleolus. The mean 30 day effusion score of the HA treated group (27 joints) was 0.67 while the mean of the 30 day placebo group (30 joints) was 2.05 (P &lt; or = 0.0001). Similar results were noted when comparing treated vs. placebo for each lesion location as well as for lesion sizes. CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Oral preparations of hyaluronan are being used to treat joint disease in horse. Anecdotal reports supporting the efficacy of these preparations already exist. This study provides objective evidence that oral HA reduces joint effusion post operatively following the arthroscopic removal of an OCD lesion in the tarsocrural joint.",M2
16817736,"Cartilage-derived biomarkers and lipid mediators of inflammation in horses with osteochondritis dissecans of the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether reported alterations in metabolism of cartilage matrix in young (0 to 24 months old) horses with osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) may also be found in older (24 to 48 months old) horses with clinical signs of OCD and to investigate the role of eicosanoids in initiating these clinical signs. SAMPLE POPULATION: Synovial fluid was collected from 38 tarsocrural joints of 24 warmblood horses with (22 joints of 16 horses) or without (16 joints of 8 horses) clinical signs and a radiographic diagnosis of OCD of the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia. PROCEDURES: Turnover of type II collagen was investigated by use of specific immunoassays for synthesis (carboxypropeptide of type II collagen [CPII]) and degradation (collagenase-cleaved fragments of type II collagen [C2C]) products. Furthermore, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), leukotriene (LT) B(4), cysteinyl LTs, and prostaglandin (PG) E(2) concentrations were determined, and concentrations in joints with OCD were compared with those in joints without OCD. RESULTS: Concentrations of CPII, C2C, and GAG did not differ significantly between affected and nonaffected joints. Fluid from joints with OCD had significantly higher LTB(4) and PGE(2) concentrations than did fluids from nonaffected joints. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Altered collagen or proteoglycan turnover was not detected in 24- to 48-month-old horses at the time they developed clinical signs of OCD of the distal intermediate ridge of the tibia. However, increased concentrations of LTB(4) and PGE(2) in fluid of joints with OCD implicate these mediators in the initiation of clinical signs of OCD.",M2
16738926,"Histological and cell biological characterization of dissected cartilage fragments in human osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyle.INTRODUCTION: Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) within the weight-bearing femoral condyle carries a high risk of osteoarthritis. The definitive pathogenetic cause is unclear. Therefore biochemical and cellular features of OCD were analyzed and compared to macroscopically normal cartilage of the same joint surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dissected fragments from 14 patients and biopsies of normal cartilage from the intercondylar notch as controls were harvested at arthroscopy. Staining with safranin O to monitor proteoglycan content, alkaline phosphatase activity, and immunohistochemistry with mouse monoclonal antibodies to collagen types I, II, and X. Chondrocytes were isolated for RT-PCR to detect GAPDH, collagen types I, II, X, aggrecan, TGF-beta, BMP-7, bFGF, VEGF and IL-1. RESULTS: The dissected cartilage displayed significant variability. Apart from normal cartilage matrix components also atypical molecules such as collagen type X and alkaline phosphatase were detected at the tidemark but also across the entire dissecate, suggesting chondrocyte hypertrophy. Extended fibrous degeneration associated with collagen type I deposition was observed at the surface and may indicate chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Viable cells could be extracted from OCD and notch. Both expressed similar mRNA levels for matrix molecules, growth factors, and interleukin-1 (IL-1), however significantly more Col X mRNA was detected in dissecates. CONCLUSION: Histology suggests focal alteration of cartilage matrix originating from the basis of the joint cartilage, potentially the mineralized layer or subchondral bone. The molecular analysis indicates a disorganization of cartilage homeostasis across the joint accompanied by embryogenetic processes. The surprisingly high viability and quality of the extracted cells suggests a still preserved intrinsic repair capacity of those vital dissecates.",M2
16594202,"Computerized tomography compared with radiography in the diagnosis of lateral trochlear ridge talar osteochondritis dissecans in dogs.In this retrospective study, we compared the value of radiographic and computerized tomographic (CT) imaging for the diagnosis of lateral trochlear ridge talar osteochondritis dissecans (LTRT-<e>OCD</e>) in 11 tarsocrural joints. The flexed dorsoplantar skyline and the planta-rolateral-dorsomedial projections were the most reliable for radiographic detection of OCD fragments (in 7 of the 11 joints). Overall, radiography detected OCD fragments in 8 of 11 joints. By contrast, the OCD fragments could be visualized and exactly localized by CT in all 11 joints. Computerized tomography allowed the talar ridges to be inspected without superimposition of any bony structures. This information may be very useful when minimal invasive techniques are used to treat LTRT-OCD lesions. The findings of this study suggest that CT is superior to radiography for making a diagnosis of LTRT-OCD in the dog.",M2

From 1993 to 2002, 38 knees (28 patients) were diagnosed with OCD of the lateral femoral condyle. OCD locations were graded by the Cahill and Berg classification. The types of lateral menisci were classified by Watanabe's classification. The relationship between OCD of the lateral femoral condyle and lateral menisci was examined. On the anterior-posterior view, 25 OCDs were located in zone 4 and 13 in zone 5. The types of lateral menisci were complete discoid in 19 knees, incomplete discoid in 15, and normal in 4. Ten of the 19 complete discoid menisci were damaged. Complete discoid menisci without tears were found in OCDs located in zone 4; incomplete discoid menisci were found in OCDs located in zone 5.

16125942,"Autologous osteochondral transplantation for the treatment of chondral defects of the knee.Full-thickness chondral defects of weight-bearing articular surfaces of the knee are a difficult condition to treat. Our aim is to evaluate the mid- and long-term functional outcome of the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous osteochondral transplantation with the OATS technique. Thirty-six patients (37 procedures) were included in this study. Twenty-three patients were male and thirteen were female with a mean age of 31.9 years (range: 18-48 years). The cause of the defect was <e>OCD</e> in 10 cases, AVN in 2, lateral patellar maltracking in 7, while in the remaining 17 patients the defect was post-traumatic. The lesion was located on the femoral condyles in 26 cases and the patellofemoral joint in the remaining 11. The average area covered was 2.73 cm(2) (range: 0.8-12 cm(2)) and patients were followed for an average of 36.9 months (range: 18-73 months). The average score in their Tegner Activity Scale was 3.76 (range: 1-8), while their score in Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey ranged from 18 to 98 with an average of 72.3. Thirty-two out of 37 patients (86.5%) reported improvement of their pre-operative symptoms. All but 5 patients returned to their previous occupation while 18 went back to sports. No correlation was found between patient age at operation, the size or site of the chondral lesion and the functional outcome. We believe that autologous osteochondral grafting with the OATS technique is a safe and successful treatment option for focal osteochondral defects of the knee. It offers a very satisfactory functional outcome and does not compromise the patient's future options.",M2
16048146,"Nutraceutical therapies for degenerative joint diseases: a critical review.There is growing recognition of the importance of nutritional factors in the maintenance of bone and joint health, and that nutritional imbalance combined with endocrine abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>). Despite this, dietary programs have played a secondary role in the management of these connective tissue disorders. Articular cartilage is critically dependent upon the regular provision of nutrients (glucose and amino acids), vitamins (particularly vitamin C), and essential trace elements (zinc, magnesium, and copper). Therefore, dietary supplementation programs and nutraceuticals used in conjunction with non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may offer significant benefits to patients with joint disorders, such as OA and OCD. This article examines the available clinical evidence for the efficacy of nutraceuticals, antioxidant vitamin C, polyphenols, essential fatty acids, and mineral cofactors in the treatment of OA and related joint disorders in humans and veterinary species. This article also attempts to clarify the current state of knowledge. It also highlights the need for additional targeted research to elucidate the changes in nutritional status and potential alterations to the expression of plasma membrane transport systems in synovial structures in pathophysiological states, so that current therapy and future treatments may be better focused.",M2

Adult patients (&gt;20 years) tend to respond poorly to nonsurgical management. This case report describes the physical therapist management of an adult with OCD at the tibiofemoral joint. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old woman had insidious onset of right knee pain. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of OCD. Interventions included iontophoresis, strengthening exercises, and instruction in strategies to minimize loading across the knee. OUTCOME: The patient received 5 intervention sessions. At discharge and 9-month follow-up, she reported 95% function (Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation) and no pain while performing full work duties.

15940391,"Stage-I osteochondritis dissecans versus normal variants of ossification in the knee in children.BACKGROUND: Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) has a better prognosis than the adult type. OBJECTIVE: We postulated that the excellent prognosis of juvenile OCD could be explained, at least in part, by the erroneous diagnosis of some developmental variants of ossification as stage-I OCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Knee MRIs of 38 children, ages 7.5-17.7 years (mean and median age 13 years), were retrospectively reviewed to look for features that might separate normal variants of ossification from stage-I OCD. These included age, gender, site, configuration of the lesion, residual cartilaginous model and presence of edema. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (32 condyles) had ossification defects with intact articular cartilage suggestive of stage-I lesions. No stage-II lesions were seen in the posterior femoral condyles. Accessory ossification centers were seen in 11/16 posterior condyles and 3/16 central condyles. Spiculation of existing ossification was seen in 12/16 posterior condylar lesions and 1/16 central condyles. There was a predominance of accessory ossifications and spiculations in the patients with 10% or greater residual cartilaginous model. No edema signal greater than diaphyseal red-marrow signal was seen in the posterior condyles. Clinical follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 38 months, with clinical improvement in 22 out of 23 patients. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of normal variants in the stage-I OCD category might explain, in part, the marked difference in published outcome between the juvenile and adult forms of OCD. Ossification defects in the posterior femoral condyles with intact overlying articular cartilage, accessory ossification centers, spiculation, residual cartilaginous model, and lack of bone-marrow edema are features of developmental variants rather than OCD.",M2

Additionally observed was anterior disk displacement without reduction for both sides. We have proposed an adaptation of the previous classification of OCD for cases affecting the TMJ. We have also stressed the fundamental role of panoramic radiography on the diagnosis of stage 3 and stage 4 OCD of the TMJ. In relation to MRI, we have recommended sagittal (slice thickness of 2 mm) and coronal (slice thickness of 1 mm) fast spin-echo proton density-weighted sequences to better identify bone lesions (stage 1 and 2) and also localize osteochondral loose bodies; and coronal (slice thickness of 1 mm) fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2 weighted sequence to better evaluate OCD (stable or unstable) and the features of the occasionally associated AVN (acute or chronic).",M2

There were no complications of surgery. At an average of 77 months after operation the majority of patients had mild or no pain but with some discomfort during heavy lifting and sport. All were capable of performing simple activities of daily living, and all but one had good or excellent outcomes and rated their satisfaction highly. Only 4 of 27 patients had to give up their preferred sport because of persistent elbow problems. Thirty-eight percent of patients had recurrence of locking or catching, although these symptoms were described as better than the condition before operation and none wanted further surgical intervention. It is concluded that arthroscopic debridement and removal of loose bodies is a safe and reliable procedure for patients with persistent symptoms from OCD of the capitellum.",M2
15525932,"Surgical fixation of massive osteochondritis dissecans lesion using cylindrical osteochondral plugs.Abstract The prognosis of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) depends on the age of manifestation and the size of the lesion. Before epiphyseal closure, OCD usually responds well to the restriction of the patient's sporting activities. Surgical intervention is not always necessary. However, if the disease manifests after epiphyseal closure, it often needs surgical treatment because the lesion is usually found at an advanced stage (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICR] OCD II or more). Furthermore, if a massive lesion develops to separation (ICR OCD II or III) or displaced loose bodies (ICR OCD IV), despite restriction of sporting activities, the prognosis is poor. This report discusses 2 cases of OCD. One patient had a massive stage ICR I lesion, although the disease was found before epiphyseal closure. In the other patient, a 22-year-old man, a large separated fragment (ICR OCD IV) was found after epiphyseal closure. The separated surfaces of the fragment and the mother bed had become sclerotic. Cylindrical osteochondral grafts using jigs for Mosaicplasty (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, MA) were performed on the 2 patients, both of whom made successful recoveries. These cases suggest that cylindrical osteochondral grafting is a useful procedure for difficult cases of large lesion size or late manifestation.",M2
15253076,"Arthroscopic reattachment of osteochondritis dissecans lesions using resorbable polydioxanone pins.REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Debridement of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) cartilage lesions results in fibrocartilage and imperfect hyaline repair tissue, and forms a permanent irregularity to the subchondral bone plate. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical, radiographic and outcome effects of OCD cartilage flap reattachment for select lesions as an alternative to OCD debridement. HYPOTHESIS: Separated cartilage flaps resulting from OCD lesions may be re-incorporated into the hyaline cartilage surface by reattachment rather than debridement and removal. METHODS: Resorbable polydioxanone pins were used to reattach OCD flap lesions in 16 joints of 12 horses. Criteria for attachment, rather than removal, included an unmineralised cartilage flap on preoperative radiographs and a relatively smooth surface with some residual perimeter attachment at surgery. RESULTS: There were 12 subjects, 6 males and 6 females, 7 Thoroughbred or Standardbred weanlings, 3 Warmbloods, 1 Arabian and 1 Quarter Horse, mean age at surgery 6.8 months. All horses had effusion of the affected femoropatellar joint (n = 9), tarsocrural joint (n = 1) or fetlock (n = 2). Radiographic lesions varied in length between 1.8-6.3 cm; reattachment was used in 16 of 18 affected joints and the OCD cartilage was not satisfactory for salvage in 2 stifles. Number of pins required was 2-10. One horse was subjected to euthanasia due to a tendon laceration 8 weeks after surgery; of the remaining 11 horses, mean duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (range 4 months-8 years). Nine of these were sound and had entered work, while 2 were sound but remained unbroken 4 and 6 months post operatively, respectively. Radiographic resolution of the OCD lesion occurred in 14 of 16 pinned joints in the 9 horses with long-term follow-up. The 2 remaining joints had a 3 and a 5 mm mineralised flap in the original defect sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated cartilage flap reattachment was an alternative to removal in selected OCD lesions. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Relatively smooth OCD cartilage flaps may be salvaged by reattachment and can result in normal radiographic subchondral contour and a high likelihood of athletic performance. Further case numbers are required to determine which lesions are too irregular or contain too much mineral for effective incorporation after reattachment.",M2

The mean time of follow-up was 36 months (range, 25-49). The average age at surgery was 22.7 years (range, 19-34). The mean size of defect of OCD was 13.6 mm x 7.2 mm. Two or three osteochondral grafts (6 or 7 mm in diameter and 15-20 mm in length) were harvested from the superomedial margin of the ipsilateral knee. A partial osteotomy of the medial malleolus or osteotomy of the distal lateral tibia was performed for all cases. Being evaluated by the Freiburg ankle score, 16 of 18 ankles (88.8%) had excellent and two (11.8%) had good results.  Second-look  arthroscopy of 16 ankles revealed consistency of the osteochondral grafts and congruity between grafts and native cartilage in 14 (87.5%), and a softening or fissuring of the osteochondral graft in two.

Ten cadaveric lower extremities were used to develop and evaluate a retrograde osteochondral grafting technique applying computer-assisted surgery. With the help of a computed tomography (CT)-based navigation system, a guide wire was placed from the lateral talar process into the posteromedial talar trochlea where OCD lesions are predominantly located. Cannulated reamers and arthroscopic shavers were used for the preparation of the recipient hole. The grafts, with diameters of 4.5 mm, 6.5 mm or 8.5 mm were harvested from the lateral femoral trochlea and inserted in a retrograde fashion. The last five cadavers were analyzed for accuracy of surface reconstruction and graft stability. For this purpose a medial malleolar osteotomy and a CT scan was performed. We found steps in the joint surface to range from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm (mean 0.9 mm, SD 0.4) with the graft always below the surrounding cartilage. Graft subsidence occurred at an applied force of 26.4 +/- 4.6 N. This study indicates that osteochondral cylinders can be inserted in a retrograde fashion to reconstruct the posteromedial talus. Good surface congruency and sufficient graft stability can be achieved.",M2

12911240,"The mosaicplasty technique for osteochondral lesions of the talus.For years, <e>OCD</e> of the talus has been known as a symptomatic lesion that causes pain, recurrent synovitis, altered joint mechanism, and obstruction from loose bodies. It is a probable precursor of ankle osteoarthritis because of altered joint mechanics and recurrent synovitis. With the notable advance of diagnostic imaging and the advent of ankle arthroscopy, classification of the lesion has become standardized, which allowed for the comparison of treatment options. Arthroscopic procedures (eg, debridement, retrograde drilling, bone grafting, by nature of their minimally invasive approach, have a great advantage in treating small defects and stable OCD lesions compared with open methods. For larger osteochondral defects and unstable OCD lesions, the optimal treatment is the long-term replacement and integration of type-specific hyaline cartilage. In principle, mosaicplasty autogenous osteochondral transplantation fills these criteria. The early- and medium-term results are encouraging, complete with confirmatory radiographs and histology, and hold promise for this procedure to provide lasting relief of symptoms and the prevention of ankle arthrosis. Under the current dichotomy of nonoperative and operative treatments giving satisfactory results, and few comparative studies, there is a need for a randomized, prospective study in the treatment of talar OCD to define a reproducible treatment algorithm.",M2

Electronic databases from January 1966 to June 2000 were systematically screened. Based on our inclusion criteria, 39 studies describing the results of treatment strategies for OCD of the talus were included. No randomized clinical trials (RCT) were identified. Fourteen studies described the results of nonoperative treatment (NT); 4: the results of excision alone; 10: the results of excision and curettage (EC); 21: the results of excision, curettage, and drilling (ECD); 2: the results of cancellous bone grafting after EC; 1: the results of osteorchondral transplantation; 3: the results of fixation; and 1: the results of retrograde drilling. The average success rate of NT was 45%. Comparison of different surgical procedures showed that the highest average success rate is reached by excision, curettage, and drilling (ECD; 86%), followed by excision and curettage (EC; 78%) and excision alone (38%). On the basis of this systematic review, we conclude that NT and excision alone are not to be recommended in treating talar OCD. Both EC and ECD have been shown to lead to a high percentage good/excellent results. At the present time, ECD seems to be the most effective treatment strategy for osteochondral defect of the talus. Due to great diversity in the articles and variability in treatment results, however, no definitive conclusions can be drawn.

The lesions of 16 knees of 12 patients with OCD of the femoral condyles failed to heal by conservative treatment for more than 3 months (average 5-6 months) and thereafter were arthroscopically treated with drilling from not the transarticular but the intercondylar bare area without damaging the articular surface. Eight lesions involved the medial femoral condyle, and eight involved the lateral femoral condyle. The average follow-up was 16 months. All lesions healed after drilling, and the average time of healing was 4 months by X-ray and 7 months by MRI. The average Lysholm score improved from an average of 70.4 points at preoperation to an average of 97.8 points after operation.

Currently, efforts to induce healing and regeneration of cartilage are being directed toward enhancing the natural potential of cartilage to replace the damaged tissue with cells that can generate cartilage. Mosaicplasty and ACT are carried out in the same way, have similar therapeutic indications, and have been demonstrated capable of reconstructing hyaline cartilage with similar clinical results. ACT is the most recent technique and, in the authors' opinion, is preferable in that it is less invasive at the donor site and gives better histologic results because of the reconstruction of a continuous cartilage sheath compared with that achieved by mosaicplasty. Furthermore, with this technique, it is possible to forecast the possibility of improvement owing to further technical and biologic advancements. The authors are currently experimenting with the use of adhesive patches with substitution of the periosteum, resulting in less morbidity. The use of growth factors and new tissue engineering techniques in the future would simplify the methodology, rendering it less invasive and more effective.",M2
12499954,"Role of magnetic resonance imaging and clinical criteria in predicting successful nonoperative treatment of osteochondritis dissecans in children.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers promise as a noninvasive method to determine the potential of an osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) lesion to heal without surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to compare the value of MRI, plain radiographs, and clinical findings in predicting the success of nonoperative treatment of juvenile OCD lesions. Twenty-seven lesions in 24 patients (mean age 12.2 y) with OCD of the distal femur diagnosed based on MRI were identified. A radiologist or orthopaedist, blinded to the clinical status of the patients, correlated the MRIs with patient outcome. MRIs were assessed for lesion size, location, and four criteria evaluating signal intensity changes and articular surface defects to determine lesion stability. Older, more skeletally mature patients with at least one sign of instability on MRI were most likely to have nonoperative treatment fail. Nonoperative treatment failed most often in patients with large lesions in weightbearing areas, as seen on lateral radiographs. However, location based on anteroposterior radiographs was not statistically significant for predicting treatment outcome. Although no single factor was uniformly predictive of successful nonoperative treatment, younger, skeletally immature patients with no MRI criteria of instability were most amenable to nonoperative treatment.",M2
12479388,"Microscopic localization of active gelatinases in equine osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) cartilage.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the equine joint. METHODS: Equine articular cartilage was obtained from normal (N = 8) and osteochondrotic (OCD) (N = 6) femoropatellar joints from horses at necropsy. The activity of gelatinase MMPs was determined in sections of cartilage by in situ gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Gelatinase activity was markedly increased in articular cartilage obtained from OCD samples and was particularly prominent in the deep cartilage zone. Activity was only seen in the pericellular area of chondrocytes. In addition, in OCD cartilage there were vertical lines of activity, starting from the deep zone and radiating towards the articular surface. In contrast, normal cartilage showed only a very small amount of gelatinolytic activity, which was not restricted to specific cartilage zones. Gelatin zymography of culture supernatants from isolated chondrocytes demonstrated increased production of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from OCD chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Sections of articular cartilage from OCD lesions revealed MMP activity, especially in the deep zone adjacent to the calcified subchondral bone. This MMP activity could account for the loss of cartilage integrity in the deep cartilage zone and the vertical lines of activity could represent areas of mechanical weakness, likely to result in fissures and the release of cartilage fragments into the joint space.",M2

TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Autologous bone sticks were taken from the ipsilateral tibial metaphysis and used in the arthroscopic fixation of unilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in 11 patients (5 female and 6 male). Patient age ranged from 11 to 20 years (mean, 16 years). Fixation of the partially dislocated fragments of the OCD of the knee was performed following a modified arthroscopic procedure and autologous bone graft. RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 15 to 108 months (mean, 48 months). Based on modified criteria of Hughston et al., results were satisfactory in 90.9% and unsatisfactory in 9.1% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic fixation of OCD of the knee with autologous bone sticks is technically simple and nonaggressive and provides satisfactory results in most cases.",M2
12355306,"Arthroscopic repair of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles with metal staple fixation: a report of 28 cases.In a retrospective clinical study we evaluated the outcome of arthroscopic repair of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the femoral condyles with metal stable fixation. Twenty-eight knees of 26 patients (mean age 20 years) with OCD of the knee were treated by fixation of the fragments with Hoffmann's dynamic metal staples arthroscopically and by additional arthrotomy in 7 knees. At follow-up (mean 4 years, 1-7) patients were interviewed for any residual symptoms and underwent a routine clinical and radiographic examination. The clinical results were based on the grading scale of Lysholm. The 17 knees which did not require further surgery showed 13 instances of complete healing, 3 of partial healing, and 1 of nonhealing. The 11 knees which had reoperations showed 2 instances of complete healing, 5 of partial healing, and 4 nonhealing. There was no significant difference between early or late surgery, and results were not related significantly to site of the lesion, handling of the fragment and the crater, percutaneous drilling, or type of fragmentation. Clinical grading of 13 knees was as excellent, 11 good, and 4 fair. Broken stables were observed in 9 knees, and they were removed from 5 knees. Complete healing was thus achieved in one-half and partial healing in one-third of cases. The metal staples used here fit for use in the arthroscopic fixation of the OCD of the knee, although the staples had a marked liability to break.",M2
12202124,"Biomarkers of joint tissue metabolism in canine osteoarthritic and arthritic joint disorders.OBJECTIVE: To explore the levels of matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-1 (TIMP-1), 5D4 keratan sulfate, and two 3B3 chondroitin-sulfate epitopes in several canine osteoarthritic and inflammatory arthropathies. METHODS: Blood and synovial fluid were obtained from 103 dogs with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLR), osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>), fragmented coronoid process (FPC), patella luxation (PL), hip dysplasia (HD) or infectious arthritis. Dogs with non-musculosceletal disorders were used as controls. The biomarkers were measured by immunoassays. RESULTS: Median levels of synovial MMP-3, TIMP-1 and molar ratios of MMP/TIMP-1 were significantly higher in the arthritis than in the control group. The release of 5D4 keratan sulfate epitope and serum 3B3 neoepitope was reduced in arthritis patients. Increases in synovial TIMP-1 in OA were less pronounced and the molar ratio of MMP-3/TIMP-1 remained far below 1.0, demonstrating a surplus of the protease inhibitor. In osteoarthritic patients median levels of synovial 5D4 keratan sulfate were up-regulated after ACLR and PL and were inversely correlated with increasing duration of lameness. Serum TIMP-1 levels were significantly reduced in the joint disorder group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Our observations present the TIMP-1 serum level as a potential marker for the detection of degenerative changes in cartilage and also indicate that in canine OA, the MMP-3 mediated matrix destruction is not of major importance. However MMP-3 seems to be a sensitive marker for the local inflammation in canine arthritis.",M2

Of more than 140 patients having elbow arthroscopy at our institution, 10 patients (11 elbows) had OCD of the capitellum and fulfilled inclusion criteria. Criteria included symptoms of at least 2 years' duration, loss of motion for at least 6 months, or radiographic evidence of secondary degenerative changes. One patient was lost to follow-up. The remaining 9 (10 elbows) were male patients with a median age of 20 years (range, 15 to 58 years). Follow-up averaged 4.6 years (range, 2 to 8 years). Using a 100-point system, postoperative elbow scores averaged 92 (range, 55 to 100).

12043980,"Autologous osteochondral grafting for talar cartilage defects.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of Osteochondral Autograft Transfer System (OATS) for the treatment of symptomatic osteochondral defects of the talus using standardized outcome analysis. Nineteen patients with symptomatic osteochondral defect (<e>OCD</e>) of the talus were treated with autologous osteochondral grafting. There were six men and 13 women. The average age was 32 years (range, 18 to 48 years). The average duration of symptoms prior to surgery was 4.2 years (range, three months to 12 years). All patients had failed nonoperative treatment, and 13 (68%) patients had failed prior excision, curettage and/or drilling of the lesion. The average size of the lesion prior to autografting was 12 mm x 10 mm (range, 10 x 5 mm to 20 x 20 mm). Donor plugs were harvested from the trochlear border of the ipsilateral femoral condyle. Ankle exposure was obtained with a medial malleolar osteotomy in 13 patients, arthrotomy in five patients and lateral malleolar osteotomy in one patient. Clinical evaluations were performed for both the recipient ankle and donor knee using the AOFAS Ankle/Hindfoot Scale and Lysholm knee scale, respectively. The average follow-up time was 16 months (range, 12 to 30 months). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score was 88 (range, 60 to 100). Most patients had occasional mild pain, but excellent function, range of motion, stability and alignment. The average postoperative ankle score for the 13 patients who failed prior surgery was 91 (range, 84 to 100). The average postoperative Lysholm knee score was 97 (range, 87 to 100). Only two patients had mild knee pain. Postoperative radiographs were available for 13 patients. There was no evidence of graft subsidence and all grafts healed. All malleolar osteotomies united. Seventeen (89%) patients said that they would undergo the procedure again. The results of osteochondral autograft transplant for OCD lesions of the talus demonstrate excellent postoperative ankle scores including improvement of pain and function with minimal knee donor site morbidity. Also, our results indicate that this is an effective salvage procedure following failed previous procedures and for patients with longstanding symptoms.",M2
11951196,"Arthroscopic versus conservative treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: value of magnetic resonance imaging in therapy planning and follow-up.PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to control the short-term outcome of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the femoral condyle depending on conservative or surgical treatment at the beginning of therapy. TYPE OF STUDY: Case series. METHODS: Treatment planning for OCD depended on the stage on MRI when analyzing the appearance of the interface between parent bone and fragment on T1- and T2-weighted images. Twenty-seven patients received conservative treatment and 46 patients underwent arthroscopic surgery. After 20 to 24 months, patients were re-evaluated by MRI to assess the condition of bony fragment, parent bone, and interface so as to determine partial or complete remission, no change, or progression of OCD. RESULTS: After conservative treatment, MRI showed partial or complete remission in 30% of patients and no change in 63%. Arthroscopic treatment led to remission in 37% and to no change in 57%. Progressive disintegration of OCD was found on MRI in 7% of conservatively treated patients and in 7% of the surgery patients. In 33.3% of the patients initially treated conservatively, it was decided to treat them arthroscopically because of ongoing, unacceptable clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of remission and progression were not significantly different between the groups. The patients' age was significantly correlated to the rate of consolidation. OCD in juveniles under 16 years of age followed a milder course than in adults.",M2
11922369,"Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in children. A comparison of MRI and arthroscopic findings.The treatment of osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) in children and adolescents is determined by the stability of the lesion and the state of the overlying cartilage. MRI has been advocated as an accurate way of assessing and staging such lesions. Our aim was to determine if MRI scans accurately predicted the subsequent arthroscopic findings in adolescents with OCD of the knee. Some authors have suggested that a high signal line behind a fragment on the T2-weighted image indicates the presence of synovial fluid and is a sign of an unstable lesion. More recent reports have suggested that this high signal line is due to the presence of vascular granulation tissue and may represent a healing reaction. We were able to improve the accuracy of MRI for staging the OCD lesion from 45% to 85% by interpreting the high signal T2 line as a predictor of instability only when it was accompanied by a breach in the cartilage on the T1-weighted image. We conclude that MRI can be used to stage OCD lesions accurately and that a high signal line behind the OCD fragment does not always indicate instability. We recommend the use of an MRI classification system which correlates with the arthroscopic findings.",M2

11744854,"Osteochondritis dissecans involving the trochlea: report of two patients (three elbows) and review of the literature.Osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) is an idiopathic lesion of subchondral bone resulting in separation of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Osteochondritis of the elbow primarily involves the capitellum. Only two cases involving the trochlea have been reported, one in the English literature and one in the German literature. Osteochondritis dissecans has been confused with other joint surface abnormalities, and therefore the orthopaedic literature must be read with scrutiny. Some of these other conditions include osteochondral fractures, osteonecrosis, accessory centers of ossification, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. The authors describe two patients (one bilateral) with OCD involving the trochlea of the humerus. The first is a 12-year-old boy in whom an open biopsy was performed to rule out neoplastic lesions. The second is a 14-year-old boy with bilateral OCD that was recognized secondary to the similarity to the first patient. This patient was successfully treated conservatively. The first patient illustrates how recognition of OCD in the trochlea may prevent unnecessary biopsy. Osteochondritis dissecans should be part of the differential of lesions involving the trochlea.",M2
11536094,"Results of arthroscopic excision of the fragment in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee.PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical and radiological results of arthroscopic excision of the fragment and debridement of the crater in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee (<e>OCD</e>). Type of Study: Case series. METHODS: We investigated 20 patients with partial or complete detachment of the OCD fragment. The average age at surgery was 21 years (range, 12 to 32 years). All the patients were treated by the same surgeon. They were evaluated at an average follow-up of 9 years (range, 6 to 17 years). RESULTS: The combined subjective and objective evaluation showed excellent and good results for 85% of the patients. Radiographic studies showed 2 grades of worsening (from no degenerative signs preoperatively to narrowing of the joint line up to 50% at follow-up) in 1 patient (5%). One grade of worsening (Fairbank's changes without joint space narrowing) was found in 45% of weight-bearing anteroposterior radiographic views and in 35% of weight-bearing bent knee posteroanterior views. Statistical correlations were significant between radiographic degenerative changes and the size of the osteochondral lesion at surgery, with larger lesions resulting in greater degenerative changes. CONCLUSIONS: The arthroscopic removal of an osteochondral fragment and debridement of the crater is a viable option in the treatment of grade III and IV OCD lesions. Results are better in lesions less than 2 cm(2).",M2
11513159,"Osteochondral injuries.Osteochondral injuries are an important type of musculoskeletal trauma that can lead to disabling arthritis if not recognized and treated appropriately in the early stages. The anatomic configuration and biomechanical function of a joint are important for understanding its particular pattern of osteochondral injury and the resultant imaging appearance. The imaging of osteochondral fractures and osteochondrosis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) is reviewed in this article, with particular attention to differentiating surgical and nonsurgical lesions on the basis of their appearance with advanced imaging modalities. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved both the sensitivity and specificity for detection and characterization of osteochondral injuries. MRI is currently the modality of choice for the detection and staging of osteochondral injuries. It has the greatest sensitivity owing to its ability to depict marrow edema and directly assess the fracture clefts of stage 3 lesions, as well as the morphology of articular cartilage. Newer strategies for differentiating stable from unstable osteochondral fragments include MR arthrography and intravenous contrast-enhanced MRI.",M2
11503979,"Mosaicplasty for the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the talus: two to seven year results in 36 patients.An osteochondral defect (<e>OCD</e>) is known as a symptomatic lesion causing pain, recurrent synovitis, and altered joint mechanics most commonly in a weight-bearing joint. Loose bodies may develop, which may then cause joint destruction and/or locking. The damage to the articular surface is most likely a precursor of ankle osteoarthritis. With the recent advances in diagnostic imaging, such as MRI, as well as the development of ankle arthroscopy, the identification and classification of these lesions has become much more precise. This allows more accurate staging and improves treatment recommendations. The assessment of a particular treatment is also improved. A variety of treatment alternatives are now available. These include arthroscopic procedures including debridement, retrograde drilling, and bone grafting. Compared to open treatment, arthroscopic procedures may be particularly advantageous in the treatment of small defects and stable OCD lesions. Until recently, however, favorable results have been less predictable for large or unstable osteochondral defects. We treat these more difficult lesions with a mosaic autogenous osteochondral transplantation. In our hands, this appears to provide an optimal treatment result. The present report evaluates the clinical outcome of 36 patients followed for two to seven years after a mosaicplasty autogenous osteochondral transplantation from a non or less weight bearing portion of the knee to the ipsilateral talus. Ankle function was measured by the Hannover scoring system and showed good to excellent results in 34 cases (94%) with no long term donor site morbidity. The encouraging clinical results are supplemented with radiographs and histology, which support the premise of lasting relief of symptoms and prevention of ankle arthrosis.",M2
11494842,"Osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum. Diagnosis and treatment.Elbow pain seen in the at-risk athlete, such as a baseball player (in particular, a pitcher) or gymnast, should raise suspicion for <e>OCD</e>. OCD of the humeral capitellum remains a difficult problem to treat. Once radiographic changes are obvious, long-term studies suggest that half of affected individuals will be symptomatic. Currently, the key to successful treatment is early detection. Gymnasts, in general, fare worse in returning to sport. The reason is not entirely clear but is likely related to the amount of force directed across the elbow and the nature of the sport. Pitchers sometimes can be returned, but to another position. Radiographs remain the screening test of choice but can give the surgeon a false sense of security, because changes early in the disease process may not be obvious radiographically. Views at 45 degrees flexion and contralateral elbow views are helpful. The advent of MR imaging now allows the practicing orthopaedic surgeon to assess very early lesions effectively that might otherwise be underappreciated on radiographs. With more advanced lesions, radiographic findings are more obvious and demonstrate the more classic capitellar fragment with a surrounding zone of lucency. MR imaging is this setting is helpful in assessing the overlying articular cartilage and, hence, the stability of the fragment. In the absence of obvious loose bodies or mechanical symptoms, rest is the first step in treatment. If symptoms persist, then operative intervention is indicated. About half of these patients heal with nonoperative treatment. Pretreatment assessment of fragment viability has not traditionally been incorporated into the treatment algorithm. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that stability and viability of a fragment can be assessed using intravenous contrast. Knowledge of the fragment viability could allow those lesions likely to heal without surgical intervention to be distinguished from those requiring surgical intervention. The procedure should be chosen based on the size of the lesion and the integrity of the subchondral bone. Subchondral drilling and microfracture can only resurface defects and cannot reconstitute subchondral bone. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has limited ability to address subchondral bone loss, whereas autograft and allograft osteochondral transplantation can restore subchondral bone. Most authors would agree that there is no role currently for reduction and fixation of long-standing, free loose bodies. No consensus exists regarding acute dislodging of an in situ loose fragment. Long-term results after radiographic changes are present suggest a degenerative course in about half the patients. Whether the newer techniques of cartilage resurfacing will significantly impact the natural history of this process remains to be seen.",M2
11447548,"Osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle following total resection of the discoid lateral meniscus.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of 6 athletically active children with symptomatic osteochondritis dissecans (<e>OCD</e>) of the lateral femoral condyle following total resection for a torn discoid lateral meniscus and to discuss its cause. TYPE OF STUDY: Case series. METHODS: Six patients in whom OCD affecting the lateral femoral condyle developed after total resection of the discoid lateral meniscus participated in a detailed clinical, radiologic, and arthroscopic review. The average age at the time of meniscectomy was 9 years (range, 6 to 12 years). At a mean of 50 months (range, 36 to 65 months) after surgery they developed recurrent pain in the treated knee; all had radiologic abnormalities at the lateral femoral condyle consistent with OCD. Before the recurrence of pain, all patients had been continuously engaged in sports activity. Radiologic and arthroscopic findings of the OCD lesions were assessed. Clinical outcomes of surgical treatment for OCD were also documented. RESULTS: The radiographic evaluation showed all lesions to be in the central portion of the lateral femoral condyle on the anteroposterior views and posteriorly next to a line extending distally from the posterior femoral cortex on the lateral views. Arthroscopic evaluation revealed softening in 2 knees, a separated fragment in 2 knees, and a completely loose fragment in 2 knees. All lesions were treated surgically, including 2 drillings of the lesion, 2 fixations of separated fragment, and 2 excisions of loose bodies with drilling. At an average follow-up period of 51 months (range, 22 to 77 months), all patients but 1 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated impaction in sports activities on the immature osteochondral structures under altered mechanical force transmission after total resection of the discoid meniscus might be a predisposing factor in the development of OCD in the lateral femoral condyle.",M2

ANIMALS: 31 dogs with OCD and 11 clinically normal purpose-bred dogs. PROCEDURE: Cartilage samples were evaluated microscopically, and GAG content was determined. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for type-I, -II, and -X collagen. Sections were subjectively evaluated for location and intensity of staining. RESULTS: Cartilage affected by OCD had a variety of pathologic changes and significantly lower GAG concentrations than did normal cartilage. Normal cartilage had no detectable type-I collagen. For dogs &lt; 9 months of age, cartilage affected by OCD had significantly more type-I collagen but significantly less type-X collagen than did control cartilage. For dogs &gt; 12 months of age, cartilage affected by OCD contained significantly more type-I collagen than did control cartilage. There was a significant negative correlation between immunoreactivity of type-I collagen and that of type-II and -X collagen. A significant positive correlation was found between immunoreactivity of type-II and -X collagen.

Electronic databases from 1966 to June 2000 were systematically screened. Thirty-nine studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. No randomized clinical trials could be identified. The results of nonoperative treatment were described in 14 studies, of excision alone in 4, of excision and curettage in 10, of excision, curettage and drilling in 21, of cancellous bone grafting in 2, of fixation in 3, and of osteochondral transplantation in 1. Good or excellent results were found in 45% of the cases. Comparison of different surgical procedures showed that excision, curettage and drilling resulted in the highest mean success rate (86%), followed by excision and curettage (76%) and excision alone (38%). From the results of this systematic review we conclude that nonoperative treatment and excision alone are not to be recommended for treatment of talar OCD.

11398361,"Treatment algorithm for osteochondral injuries of the knee.The treatment of osteochondral fractures and <e>OCD</e> lesions in the knee is controversial. Many new procedures and techniques have been developed recently to address osteochondral lesions, indicating that no single procedure is accepted universally. Our treatment algorithm is based on the age of the patient, skeletal maturity, and the presence of adequate subchondral bone attached to the chondral lesion. Most nondisplaced lesions in the patient with open physes will heal with conservative treatment. The onset of skeletal maturity indicates a need for a more aggressive treatment approach. If adequate cortical bone is attached to the fragment, drilling of stable lesions, or drilling with fixation of unstable or loose fragments is appropriate. Autologous bone graft can be necessary to stimulate healing and properly reconstruct the subchondral bony contour. For failed fixation attempts or lesions not amenable to fixation, each treating surgeon must be proficient and comfortable with an articular surface reconstruction technique. The goal for the reconstructive procedure, to produce a smooth gliding articular surface of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, is possible using current techniques including mosaicplasty, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Débridement, drilling, microfracture, and abrasion chondroplasty have been shown to result in fibrocartilage with inferior mechanical properties when compared with hyaline cartilage. No long-term studies have been published, however, to confirm the benefits of replacing osteochondral defects with hyaline cartilage rather than fibrocartilage. Although the results of many reconstructive procedures are quite encouraging with early follow up, the ultimate goal is to prevent long-term degenerative arthritis. Only well-designed prospective studies with long-term follow up will determine the adequacy of these procedures in reaching the ultimate goal. This treatment algorithm is based on the senior author's (WGC) experience with the complex dilemma of osteochondral lesions of the knee.",M2

The mean follow-up was 40 months (8-82). All patients were evaluated by clinical examination, plain radiography and MRI using a standard protocol. RESULTS: The clinical Bray score improved significantly from 58 preoperative to 82 postoperative. Using a visual analogue scale we saw a significant reduction of the patients pain level post-op. In 72% of the patients the preoperative MRI was able to predict the accurate stage of the cartilage. Postoperative MRI showed no more lesion in 3, intact articular cartilage in 11, and disrupted cartilage in 4 joints. There was no correlation between clinical, plain radiographical, and MRI findings postoperative. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopy remains the golden standard in evaluating articular cartilage. Using our data, MRI is not the method of choice in the follow-up of surgically treated OCD lesions of the talus. Postoperative use of intravenous contrast media gave no additional information. Postoperative MRI should be reserved only for symptomatic patients to gather additional information about the actual state of the OCD. Afterwards a prompt arthroscopy of the symptomatic ankle should be performed.",M2
