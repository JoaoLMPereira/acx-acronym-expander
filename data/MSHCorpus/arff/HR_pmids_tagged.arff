17600937,"Distribution of human papillomavirus types in different histological subtypes of cervical adenocarcinoma.Little information is available regarding distribution of HPV types in different histological subtypes of adenocarcinoma (AC). Thus, in this study we examined the frequency of high-risk (<e>hr</e>) HPV types in AC, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSQ). A total of 102 cases of primary cervical adenocarcinoma (26 AIS and 76 invasive AC) obtained from pathology files from 1995-2006 were histologically subtyped. Our results demonstrated that endocervical type occupied the major subtype of AC (22/66) followed by ADSQ (17/66) where as in the group of AIS endocervical type (12/23) was followed by intestinal type of AIS (7/23). Successful DNA extraction was obtained in 89 samples; 81 out of 89 (91.0%) tested positive for HPV DNA. The prevalence of HPV DNA in AIS, AC and ADSQ was 91.3% (21/23), 90.9% (60/66) and 94.1% (16/17), respectively. We found HPV 18 type to be the most predominant type in AIS (11/21) and AC (17/60) followed by HPVof undeternmined type in AIS (3/21) and HPV 16 in AC (9/60) as the sole viral type. HPV 18 was most frequently detected type in all histological subtypes of AIS and AC. We have detected HPV DNA in all 5 samples of clear cell carcinoma (CCC), although other studies have reported a highly variable prevalence of HPVDNA in CCC. The most prevalent HPV type in ADSQ was HPV-16 followed by HPV 33 as single type. The observed overall predominance of HPV 18 in AIS (chi(2) = 6.109, p&lt; or = 0.025) and AC (chi(2) = 8.927, p&lt; or =0.01) as well as of HPV 16 in ADSQ (chi(2) = 10.164, p &lt; or = 0.01) was statistically significant. Our data revealed statistically significant predominance of single hrHPV infections in AIS (16/21; chi(2) = 11.523, p &lt; 0.001) and AC (37/60; X2 = 6.533, p &lt; 0.025) whereas multiple hrHPV infections were more abundant in AC comparing to AIS (23/81and 5/81, respectively; chi(2) = 13.989, p&lt; or =0.001).",M1
17598510,"Retrospective study of the prevalence of high-risk human papillomaviruses among Croatian women.The infection with Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause for cervical cancer. There are at least 15 High-Risk (<e>HR</e>) HPV types that are significantly associated with progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to cervical cancer. Since previous studies showed that the prevalence of HPV in cervical cancers varies among different geographic regions, we wanted to investigate the prevalence of HPV types in Croatia, especially low abundant HR HPV types. By means of consensus primers directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we analysed cervical DNA samples of 2,136 Croatian women, mostly with abnormal cervical smears, in order to detect the presence of HPV Type-specific primers were then used to determine Low-Risk (LR) HPV types 6/11 and HR HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. Out of 2,136 specimens, 1,255 (58.8%) were positive for HPV More than half of positive samples were typed (64.5%) and 35.5% still remained untyped. Multiple HPV infections were found in 10.3% of the cases. The most prevalent type, including both single and multiple infections, was HPV16 with the prevalence of 15.9%, followed by HPV types 31, 6/11, 33, 18, 52, 45 and 58 with 8.7%, 7.1%, 4.5%, 3.8%, 2.3%, 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. The significant increase of frequency from Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL) to High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL) was observed for HR HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33 but not 45, 52 and 58. The frequency of unknown HPV types was almost the same in cervical specimens of women with LSIL and those with HSIL, 19.8% and 21.1%, respectively. The prevalence of HPV infection rate decreased significantly with patient age from 68.5% (age group 12 to 24 years) to 38.8% (age group 45 to 54 years). But, in women aged 55 or older the overall prevalence increased to 56.6%. Our results indicate that prevalence of HR HPV types in Croatia is similar to other countries. We suggest that HPV positive women in Croatia should be closely monitored by typing for HR HPV types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58.",M1
17598509,"Human papillomavirus DNA typing in the cervical specimens among women of Split and Dalmatian County.Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of cervical cancer, the second most common cancer in women worldwide. More than 200 types of HPV have been described, and within this range more than 40 types attack epithelium of genital tract. The types that were most commonly related to the development of cervical cancer are called high-risk types (<e>HR</e> HPV). There are very few studies about HPV prevalence in Croatia and there is an absolute lack of data for Split and Dalmatian County. Therefore, during a 6 month period, we routinely screened 570 women for HPV DNA at the Educational Public Health Institute of Split and Dalmatian County. HR HPV was detected in cervical exfoliated cells, by using Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA test. Out of the total number of tested women, 200 (35%) of them were positive to HR HPV Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays were employed for HR HPV genotyping in positive specimens. The following frequency was observed: HPV 16 in 10%, HPV 18 in 6.1%, HPV 31 in 2.6%, HPV 33 in 1.9%, HPV 52 in 1.4%, HPV 59 in 0.7%, HPV 45 in 0.4% specimens, while 11.9% of tested specimens currently remained untyped. It is necessary to expand this study to a larger number of women, in order to better evaluate genital HPV types distribution among women in this region.",M1
16617594,"Marked improvement in survival among adult Croatian AIDS patients after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment.We compared the survival of patients following the first AIDS event in Croatia from the period 1986-1996 to the period 1997-2000. A total of 72 (81.8%) out of 88 patients from 1986-1996 and 18 (32.1%) out of 56 from 1997-2000 died. Survival following the first AIDS-defining illness markedly improved in the period 1997-2000 compared to the period 1986-1996 (adjusted Hazard Ratio (<e>HR</e>) for patients surviving more than 6 months: 0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.04-0.29). A CD4+ cell count of &lt; 100 x 10(6)/L was an independent risk factor for patients surviving up to 2 years (adjusted HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.1-3.43, p = 0.02). Patients with tuberculosis or fungal infections had a longer survival when compared to other diagnosis (adjusted HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32-0.90, p = 0.01). However, despite dramatic survival benefit of combination antiretroviral therapy, mortality at six months following the first AIDS event was similar in the two study periods and the one-year probability of death was still substantial (27.2%) in the period 1997-2000.",M1
16617590,"Impact of war on central nervous system tumors incidence--a 15-year retrospective study in Istria County, Croatia.The aim of study was to analyze epidemiological features of central nervous system (CNS) tumors diagnosed in Istria County, Croatia, with a particular emphasis on incidence dynamics during the wartime (1991-1995). The data were extracted from the medical records of patients with CNS tumors admitted to the Department of Neurology of Pula General Hospital in the period from the 1st January 1986 to the 31st December 2000, N = 364. For calculation of rates, we used data from the 2001 Croatian consensus http://www.dzs.<e>hr</e>/Eng/Census/census2001.htm. Data are presented as counts and incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 persons-years in the case of annual rates. Annual incidence rates are shown as  raw  incidence rates and smoothed 5-year rolling average rates. The examined patient-related variables were: sex, age, occupation, premorbidity and comorbidity, with a particular emphasis on psychosomatic disorders and negative habits. The analyzed tumor-related variables included clinical manifestation, localization, and applied diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Primary tumors were separated from the metastatic, and the latter were analysed with respect to their site of origin. The lowest incidence of CNS tumors (10 patients) was reported in 1990, and the highest (42 patients) in 1993. The incidence dynamics of CNS tumors showed a rapidly progressive increase over the 1991-1995 period, followed by the return to average values. The access to a better and more readily available diagnostics may only partially explain this phenomenon. Therefore, we analyzed other factors that may have contributed towards the rapid increase in the number of CNS tumors, such as its coincidence with the war or psychotrauma. The results confirm the observational clinical hypothesis of an extreme increase in the number of CNS tumors during the period under consideration.",M1

20564823,"[Change of hydrogen sulfide content in serum of rats after cardiopulmonary resuscitation]AIM: To investigate variation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in serum of rats after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and explore its pathophysiological role in CPR. METHODS: The 30 male SD rats were randomly divided into control group (n=6) and experimental group (n=24), then models of cardiac arrest (CA) were established in rats of experimental group by transcutaneous electrical epicardium stimulation. Blood samples were collected before CA, at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for testing the serum levels of H2S, at the same time rectal temperature (Tr), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and respiration rate (R) were recorded. Next to analyze the dynamic variation of H2S content in serum of the rats after CPR and its correlation of the above-mentioned signs of life. RESULTS: (1) In experimental group, all of the 24 rats were successfully induced CA and resuscitation; at end points (12 h after ROSC) there were 14 rats alive and their vital signs were stable. There was no death in the control group. (2) The variation trend of H2S content in serum was different between experimental group and the control (F=12.226, P=0.003). In experimental group, H2S content in serum increased dramatically after CPR and reached peak at 6 h after ROSC, then return to the similar level of the control group. (3) H2S content in serum was negatively correlated with Tr (partial r=-0.556, P=0.000) and MAP (partial r=-0.240, P=0.002). But it wasn't correlated with HR and R (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Change of H2S content in serum of rats after CPR may be a manifestation of compensatory response after ROSC and participate in physiological processes such as body temperature and blood pressure regulation. But as for its precisely mechanisms, it still needs to be studied further.",M2
20550061,"[Heart rate: a risk factor or an epiphenomenon?]The role of heart rate (<e>HR</e>) as an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains controversial. Direct evidence supporting a causal association between HR and prognosis is still lacking even if such relation appears plausible and may be inferred from epidemiological studies and clinical trials with HR lowering agents. The introduction of If current blocking agents, namely ivabradine, has offered the novel and unique opportunity to directly and exclusively interfere with HR and, thus, to validate the presence of a causal relationship between HR and prognosis. The BEAUTIFUL trial has recently confirmed that HR is a powerful negative prognostic predictor in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Particularly, subjects with a resting HR &gt;70 b/min showed an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. In these patients, HR reduction with ivabradine was associated with a reduction in major cardiac ischemic events, though not mortality. Further data will become available with the SHIFT trial in which patients with heart failure and HR &gt; or =70 b/min are included and reduction in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations is the primary endpoint.",M2
20538669,"Low-dose, 128-slice, dual-source CT coronary angiography: accuracy and radiation dose of the high-pitch and the step-and-shoot mode.OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy and radiation doses of two low-dose protocols for coronary artery imaging with second-generation, dual-source CT in comparison with catheter angiography (CA). DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Prospective, single-centre study conducted in a referral centre enrolling 100 patients with low-to-intermediate risk and suspicion of coronary artery disease. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced, 128-slice, dual-source CT coronary angiography and CA. Patients were randomly assigned to two different low-dose CT protocols (each 100 kV/320 mA): in group A (n=50), CT was performed using the prospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-gated step-and-shoot (SAS) mode; in group B (n=50), CT was performed using the prospectively ECG-gated high-pitch mode (pitch 3.4). The image quality and presence or absence of significant coronary stenosis in all coronary segments were evaluated by two blinded and independent observers. CA served as the standard of reference. RESULTS: Sixty-one significant stenoses were found in group A, and 69 in group B. There was no significant difference in age (group A, 62+/-8 yrs; group B, 63+/-8 yrs; p=0.72), body mass index (group A, 26.4+/-3.1 kg/m2; group B, 25.9+/-2.8 kg/m2; p=0.41) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) (group A, 58+/-8 bpm; group B, 56+/-10 bpm; p=0.66) between the groups. Diagnostic image quality was obtained in 98.6% (651/660) of segments in group A and in 98.9% (642/649) in group B, with no significant differences between groups. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 94%, 91%, 85% and 97% per-patient in group A, and 93%, 94%, 89% and 97% per-patient in group B (no significant differences). The effective radiation dose in group B (0.9+/-0.1 mSv) was significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower than that in group A (1.4+/-0.4 mSv). CONCLUSIONS: Both the high-pitch and the SAS mode for low-dose CT coronary angiography provide high accuracy for the assessment of significant coronary stenoses, while the high-pitch mode further significantly lowers the radiation dose.",M2
20516426,"Effect of pregnancy on postural tachycardia syndrome.OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical presentation, autonomic dysfunction, and pregnancy outcomes in parous and nulliparous women with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and in women with POTS before and after pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study consists of women who had at least 1 pregnancy during which time they met criteria for POTS between May 1993 and July 2009. All patients underwent standard autonomic testing. POTS was defined as a heart rate (<e>HR</e>) increase of greater than 30 beats/min on head-up tilt (HUT) with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Patients' charts were reviewed retrospectively to determine pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics related to POTS did not differ between parous and nulliparous women except for disease duration (parous, 3.7+/-2.6; nulliparous, 2.1+/-2.2; P&lt;.001). Autonomic dysfunction did not differ between groups (change in HR on HUT: parous, 42.6+/-12.0 beats/min; nulliparous, 41.3+/-10.6 beats/min; P=.39). Of 116 total pregnancies, adverse pregnancy outcomes were reported in 9% and maternal complications in 1%. No complication was related to POTS. There was a trend toward modest improvement in autonomic dysfunction before and after pregnancy (change in HR on HUT: before pregnancy, 38.1+/-22.7 beats/min; after pregnancy, 21.9+/-14.9 beats/min; P=.07). CONCLUSION: The long-term impact of pregnancy on POTS does not appear to be clinically important. However, there does appear to be a trend toward improvement in the short-term postpartum period. Adverse pregnancy events were similar to those seen in the general public and do not present a barrier to women with POTS who want to have children.",M2
20458866,"A comparison of epidural anaesthesia with lignocaine, bupivacaine and a lignocaine-bupivacaine mixture in cats.A mixture of 2% lignocaine (LIG) and 0.5% bupivacaine (BUP), at respective dose rates of 2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg (LIG-BUP), was compared to LIG (4 mg/kg) and BUP (1 mg/kg) for lumbosacral epidural anaesthesia in 5 sedated cats. Each cat received all 3 treatment regimens at 1-week intervals. The cats were premedicated with an intramuscular injection of atropine sulphate (0.04 mg/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg). Onset and duration of analgesia, and time to walking were determined. Associated changes in heart rate (<e>HR</e>), respiratory frequency (fR) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded. Onset of analgesia with epidurally administered LIG-BUP (4.5 +/- 0.7 min), LIG (3.9 +/- 1.0 min) and BUP (5.0 +/- 1.0 min) was similar. Duration of analgesia with LIG-BUP (49.4 +/- 4.5 min) was significantly (P&lt;0.05) longer than with LIG (40.2 +/- 1.0 min) but shorter than with BUP (79.4 +/- 6.3 min). There were no significant differences in times to standing with LIG-BUP (26.3 +/- 6.4 min), LIG (20.4 +/- 4.7 min) and BUP (22.6 +/- 10.3 min). Minimal changes were observed in HR, fR and RT. In conclusion, duration of analgesia produced by LIG-BUP was shorter compared with BUP but longer compared with LIG. Neither LIG nor LIG-BUP has any advantage over epidural BUP in terms of onset of analgesia, time to standing and physiological responses. Therefore, lumbosacral epidural administration of BUP appears to be the best choice for a long surgical procedure lasting more than 1 hour when compared with either LIG or LIG-BUP.",M2
20452883,"Prospective study comparing skin impedance with EEG parameters during the induction of anaesthesia with fentanyl and etomidate.OBJECTIVE: Sympathetic stimulation leads to a change in electrical skin impedance. So far it is unclear whether this effect can be used to measure the effects of anaesthetics during general anaesthesia. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the electrical skin impedance during induction of anaesthesia for coronary artery bypass surgery with fentanyl and etomidate. METHODS: The electrical skin impedance was measured with the help of an electro-sympathicograph (ESG). In 47 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, anaesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl 10 mug/kg and etomidate 0.3mg/kg. During induction, the ESG (Electrosympathicograph), BIS (Bispectral IndeX), BP (arterial blood pressure) and <e>HR</e> (heart rate) values of each patient were recorded every 20 seconds.The observation period from administration of fentanyl to intubation for surgery lasted 4 min. - RESULTS: The ESG recorded significant changes in the electrical skin impedance after administration of fentanyl and etomidate(p &lt;0.05). During induction of anaesthesia, significant changes of BIS, HR and blood pressure were observed as well (p &lt;0.05).

20444810,"Changes in heart rate in the first minutes after birth.The normal range of heart rate (<e>HR</e>) in the first minutes after birth has not been defined. Objective To describe the HR changes of healthy newborn infants in the delivery room (DR) detected by pulse oximetry. Study Design All inborn infants were eligible and included if a member of the research team attended the birth. Infants were excluded if they received any form of medical intervention in the DR including supplemental oxygen, or respiratory support. HR was measured using a pulse oximeter (PO) with the sensor applied to the right hand or wrist immediately after birth. PO data (oxygen saturation, HR and signal quality) were downloaded every 2 sec and analysed only when the signal had no alarm messages (low IQ signal, low perfusion, sensor off, ambient light). Results Data from 468 infants with 61 650 data points were included. Infants had a mean (range) gestational age of 38 (25-42) weeks and birth weight 2970 (625-5135) g. At 1 min the median (IQR) HR was 96 (65-127) beats per min (bpm) rising at 2 min and 5 min to 139 (110-166) bpm and 163 (146-175) bpm respectively. In preterm infants, the HR rose more slowly than term infants. Conclusions The median HR was &lt;100 bpm at 1 min after birth. After 2 min it was uncommon to have a HR &lt;100 bpm.

DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared 1-minute HR recovery in 3 groups of children (low, medium, and high SE) using multivariable analysis. The groups were based on neighborhood SE data extracted from the US 2000 census database. SETTING: Children's Hospital Boston. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty children referred for exercise testing to exclude cardiac disease and discharged as showing normal results. MAIN EXPOSURES: Socioeconomic position and body mass index (BMI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Heart rate recovery after a maximal treadmill exercise test (Bruce protocol) following a consistent 1-minute cool-down period. RESULTS: The low SE group had a higher proportion of children with a high BMI (&gt; or =85th percentile) (P = .07) and exercised for a shorter duration, controlling for age, sex, and BMI (P &lt; .001). After adjusting for age (P &lt; .001) and sex (P &lt; .001), a significant interaction of SE group with BMI was found (P = .04). There was no difference in HR recovery in the 3 SE groups in children with a normal BMI (&lt;85th percentile). Among children with a high BMI, only those from low and middle SE neighborhoods had impaired 1-minute HR recovery. CONCLUSION: Children with a high BMI in low and middle SE positions appear to have worse cardiovascular health compared with children with a high BMI in a high SE position.",M2
20435845,"Dynamic control of maximal ventricular elastance via the baroreflex and force-frequency relation in awake dogs before and after pacing-induced heart failure.We investigated to what extent maximal ventricular elastance (E(max)) is dynamically controlled by the arterial baroreflex and force-frequency relation in conscious dogs and to what extent these mechanisms are attenuated after the induction of heart failure (HF). We mathematically analyzed spontaneous beat-to-beat hemodynamic variability. First, we estimated E(max) for each beat during a baseline period using the ventricular unstressed volume determined with the traditional multiple beat method during vena cava occlusion. We then jointly identified the transfer functions (system gain value and time delay per frequency) relating beat-to-beat fluctuations in arterial blood pressure (ABP) to E(max) (ABP--&gt;E(max)) and beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate (<e>HR</e>) to E(max) (HR--&gt;E(max)) to characterize the dynamic properties of the arterial baroreflex and force-frequency relation, respectively. During the control condition, the ABP--&gt;E(max) transfer function revealed that ABP perturbations caused opposite direction E(max) changes with a gain value of -0.023 +/- 0.012 ml(-1), whereas the HR--&gt;E(max) transfer function indicated that HR alterations caused same direction E(max) changes with a gain value of 0.013 +/- 0.005 mmHg.ml(-1).(beats/min)(-1). Both transfer functions behaved as low-pass filters. However, the ABP--&gt;E(max) transfer function was more sluggish than the HR--&gt;E(max) transfer function with overall time constants (indicator of full system response time to a sudden input change) of 11.2 +/- 2.8 and 1.7 +/- 0.5 s (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. During the HF condition, the ABP--&gt;E(max) and HR--&gt;E(max) transfer functions were markedly depressed with gain values reduced to -0.0002 +/- 0.007 ml(-1) and -0.001 +/- 0.004 mmHg.ml(-1).(beats/min)(-1) (P &lt; 0.1). E(max) is rapidly and significantly controlled at rest, but this modulation is virtually abolished in HF.",M2
20426229,"Resting blood pressure and heart rate measurement in the Canadian Health Measures Survey, cycle 1.BACKGROUND: Directly measured blood pressure (BP) data have not been collected in Canada since the Canadian Heart Health Surveys, conducted between 1985 and 1992. Because hypertension is often asymptomatic, a large proportion of those with the condition are unaware of it. DATA AND METHODS: These analyses use BP and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) data from cycle 1 of the 2007-2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) for respondents aged 6 to 79 years. Methods and quality assurance and control procedures are explained. Logistical and feasibility issues that arose during data collection are discussed. The reasons for repeating a series of measures are given. Between- and within- series variations and inter-tester variability are assessed. RESULTS: The BP and HR of almost all respondents who attended the examination centre were measured. Only one series of measurements was taken for 88% of respondents. The series was repeated for around 5% with variability in their BP or HR measurements. About 3% had HR or BP values above the screening cut-offs for the fitness tests. Almost 35% of respondents with HR or BP values above the screening cut-offs after their first series had values below the cut-points after the second series; a further 3% had values below after the third series. Within a series of six measurements, BP decreased until about the fourth measure, after which it remained stable. Mean BP and HR values indicated no inter-tester variability. INTERPRETATION: The protocol for measuring BP and HR by oscillometry in the CHMS appears to have produced reliable estimates. No benefit to repeating the series of six measurements a third time for screening purposes is evident. Four measurements may be sufficient to provide reliable BP and HR data. Oscillometry appears to eliminate inter-tester variability.",M2
20418480,"Dose-related effects of red wine and alcohol on heart rate variability.In healthy subjects a standard drink of either red wine (RW) or ethanol (EtOH) has no effect on muscle sympathetic nerve activity or on heart rate (<e>HR</e>), whereas two drinks increase both. Using time- and frequency-domain indexes of HR variability (HRV), we now tested in 12 subjects (24-47 yr, 6 men) the hypotheses that 1) this HR increase reflects concurrent dose-related augmented sympathetic HR modulation and 2) RW with high-polyphenol content differs from EtOH in its acute HRV effects. RW, EtOH, and water were provided on 3 days, 2 wk apart according to a randomized, single-blind design. Eight-minute segments were analyzed. One alcoholic drink increased blood concentrations to 36 + or - 2 mg/dl (mean + or - SE), and 2 drinks to 72 + or - 4 (RW) and 80 + or - 2 mg/dl (EtOH). RW quadrupled plasma resveratrol (P &lt; 0.001). HR fell after both water drinks. When compared with respective baselines, one alcoholic drink had no effect on HR or HRV, whereas two glasses of both increased HR (RW, +5.4 + or - 1.2; and EtOH, +5.7 + or - 1.2 min(-1); P &lt; 0.001), decreased total HRV by 28-33% (P &lt; 0.05) and high-frequency spectral power by 32-42% (vagal HR modulation), and increased low-frequency power by 28-34% and the ratio of low frequency to high frequency by 98-119% (sympathetic HR modulation) (all, P &lt; or = 0.01). In summary, when compared with water, one standard drink lowered time- and frequency-domain markers of vagal HR modulation. When compared with respective baselines, two alcoholic drinks increased HR by diminished vagal and augmented sympathetic HR modulation. Thus alcohol exerts dose-dependent HRV responses, with RW and EtOH having a similar effect.",M2
20415645,"Caffeine-induced effects on heart rate in zebrafish embryos and possible mechanisms of action: an effective system for experiments in chemical biology.Zebrafish embryos are well suited as a model system to perform chemical biology experiments effectively in educational settings. We studied the effect of caffeine on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and other phenotypes of zebrafish embryos using visual microscopy and simple imaging. Acute treatment with millimolar concentrations of caffeine in embryo medium caused a dose-dependent decrease in HR in 2-3-day-old zebrafish embryos, ultimately resulting in complete HR cessation. A characteristic pattern of decrease in HR was observed, with an initial acute drop in HR and a period of stabilization followed by complete cessation. The effects of caffeine were not reversed by cotreatment with ruthenium red and adenosine, agents known to be antagonistic to caffeine, or by changes in calcium concentration in embryo medium. Apparent cardiac arrhythmia and a typical kinking effect in the trunk/tail region were also observed because of caffeine treatment. Our results, taken together with previous reports, raise the possibility that caffeine exerts its effects on embryonic HR of zebrafish by inhibition of ether-a-go-go potassium channels. However, further experimentation is required to dissect the molecular basis of caffeine action. We demonstrate that such experiments can be used to explore the effect of small molecules, such as caffeine, on cardiovascular phenotypes and to encourage experimental design in chemical biology.",M2
20413028,"Maintenance of sinus rhythm and survival in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation.OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the presence of sinus rhythm and outcomes in patients with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: The value of sinus rhythm maintenance in patients with AF and heart failure (HF) is uncertain. METHODS: A total of 1,376 patients with AF, ejection fraction &lt; or =35%, and heart failure symptoms were randomized to a rhythm- or rate-control strategy. Detailed efficacy analyses were used to evaluate the independent effects of treatment strategy and the presence of sinus rhythm on cardiovascular outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 445 (32%) patients died and 402 (29%) experienced worsening HF. The rhythm-control strategy was not predictive of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [<e>HR</e>]: 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70 to 1.16; p = 0.41), all-cause death (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.08; p = 0.19), or worsening HF (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.10; p = 0.23). In analyses devised to isolate the effect of underlying rhythm, sinus rhythm was not associated with cardiovascular mortality [HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.87; p = 0.35), total mortality [HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.58; p = 0.57), or worsening HF [HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.37 to 1.02; p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS: A rhythm-control strategy or the presence of sinus rhythm are not associated with better outcomes in patients with AF and CHF.",M2
20410203,"Chromogranin a and the autonomic system: decomposition of heart rate variability and rescue by its catestatin fragment.Chromogranin A (CHGA/Chga) has been implicated in the genesis of systemic hypertension and consequent cardiac abnormalities. Catestatin (CST) (human CHGA(352-372)) replacement reduces blood pressure elevation and increases baroreflex sensitivity in Chga knockout (KO) mice. Because of the dampened baroreflex sensitivity, we reasoned that KO mice would display altered heart rate variability (HRV). Thus, we evaluated beat-to-beat measurements in HRV in wild-type (WT) and KO mice, before and after CST replacement. <e>HR</e> dynamics were evaluated by bipolar Einthoven electrocardiogram, with deconvolution into time and frequency domains, as well as Lorenz nonlinear return analyses. At baseline, HR was higher [444 +/- 24 beats per minute (bpm)] in KO compared with WT (330 +/- 18 bpm) mice. The total power in the HRV spectra was substantially diminished in KO animals. CST increased total power but only in KO mice. Each time-domain parameter was substantially lower in KO compared with WT mice, and the CST in the KO group could reverse the differences. Lorenz analysis revealed reductions in S1 (short axis perpendicular to the line of identity in the ellipse) and S2 (long axis along the line of identity in the ellipse) in KO animals, indicating that regulation of HRV is diminished in the parasympathetic and sympathetic domains. CST replacement caused restoration of both S1 and S2, in the KO group. These data suggest that Chga has a profound effect on autonomic tone to the heart and that its CST fragment is responsible for such actions. The results suggest future strategies for intervention in cardiovascular disorders accompanied by adverse HRV profiles.",M2
20408490,"Heart rate normalization in the analysis of heart rate variability in congestive heart failure.In this study, the effects of heart rate (<e>HR</e>) normalization in the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) were investigated to distinguish 29 patients with congestive heart failure from 54 healthy subjects in the control group. In the analysis performed, the best accuracy performances of optimal combination of standard short-term HRV measures and of HR-normalized short-term HRV measures are compared. A genetic algorithm is used to select the best features from among all possible combinations of these measures. A k-nearest-neighbour (KNN) classifier is used to evaluate the performances of the feature combinations in classifying these two data groups. The results imply that using both min-max and HR normalization improves the performance of the classification. The maximum accuracy is achieved as 93.98 per cent using k = 3 and k = 5 for the KNN classifier with the perfect positive predictivity values.",M2
20397113,"Breath holding with water immersion in synchronized swimmers and untrained women.Breath holding (BH) and water immersion induce several physiological responses. Individuals, who are BH trained tend to have an advantage versus untrained subjects. This study compared physiological responses to BH at rest between synchronized swimmers (SS) and controls (C). Each participant performed five resting BH periods in water. Breath holding periods were significantly longer for SS (109.8 +/- 39.3 vs. 78.3 +/- 25.0s), despite a similar end tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen following BH. Recovery times after BH were similar for oxygen consumption, ventilation, and blood oxygen saturation. Synchronized swimmers (SS) experienced bradycardia at 45s of max BH, whereas C did not (60 +/- 9 vs. 65 +/- 14 b x min(-1)). A significant oxygen conservation effect occurred for SS in only one BH trial. These results suggest that SS exhibited an enhanced ability to breath hold with similar respiratory responses but a lower heart rate (<e>HR</e>) during recovery, suggesting a better adaptation to BH.",M2
20391890,"Effects of preferred and nonpreferred music on continuous cycling exercise performance.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of preferred and nonpreferred music on exercise distance, Heart Rate (<e>HR</e>), and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) during continuous cycling exercise performed at high intensity. Fifteen participants performed five test sessions. During two sessions, they cycled with fixed workload on ergometer to determine the Critical Power (CP) intensity. Then, they performed three more sessions cycling at CP intensity: listening to Preferred Music, listening to Nonpreferred Music, and No Music. The HR responses in the exercise sessions did not differ among all conditions. However, the RPE was higher for Nonpreferred Music than in the other conditions. The performance under Preferred Music (9.8 +/- 4.6 km) was greater than under Nonpreferred Music (7.1 +/- 3.5 km) conditions. Therefore, listening to Preferred Music during continuous cycling exercise at high intensity can increase the exercise distance, and individuals listening to Nonpreferred Music can perceive more discomfort caused by the exercise.",M2
20384436,"Vasomotor hot flushes and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in recently post-menopausal women.BACKGROUND: Menopausal hot flushes may be a marker for a difference in vascular function. We studied the associations between hot flushes of varying severity and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>). METHODS: A total of 147 women with onset of menopause within the preceding 6-36 months reported no hot flushes (n = 23) or mild (n = 33), moderate (n = 30), or severe (n = 61). Ambulatory BP and HR were registered for 24 hours. The variables, analyzed separately for day-time and night-time, were compared among the four study groups. RESULTS: Hot flushes failed to show any relationship to mean day- or night-time BP, nocturnal dipping of BP, or HR. However, severe night-time hot flushes were accompanied by elevations in systolic BP (4.1 +/- 10.5 mmHg, P = 0.061), diastolic BP (3.1 +/- 6.8 mmHg, P = 0.032), and heart rate (3.0 +/- 7.2 beats/minute, P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Hot flushes are not associated with ambulatory BP or heart rate in normotensive, recently post-menopausal women, although severe night-time hot flush episodes are followed by significant elevations in BP and heart rate. The latter may be of clinical significance.",M2
20382294,"Use of the peak heart rate reached during six-minute walk test to predict individualized training intensity in patients with cystic fibrosis: validity and reliability.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the peak heart rate reached during a six-minute walk test (<e>HR</e>(6peak)) can be used to predict the heart rate determined at the gas exchange threshold (HR(GET)) during a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). To assess the test-retest reliability of HR(6peak). DESIGN: Case-control and reliability study. SETTING: CF unit. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with CF (n=23) and age-matched sedentary subjects (control group, n=17). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six-minute walk test, HR(6peak), CPET, and HR(GET). RESULTS: HR(GET) and HR(6peak) were not significantly different and were highly correlated in both groups (CF, r=.91, P&lt;.01; controls, r=.81, P&lt;.01). The mean differences (HR(6peak)-HR(GET)) for patients with CF and control subjects were, respectively, -0.9 beats.min(-1) (bpm) and -0.1 bpm, with neither significantly different from 0. The limits of agreements were +/-11 bpm and +/-18 bpm, respectively. HR(6peak) demonstrated excellent relative reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=.93) and was associated with low variability (standard error of measurement=4.9 bpm) in patients with CF. CONCLUSIONS: HR(6peak) is valid and demonstrates satisfactory test-retest reliability in patients with CF. These results might suggest the use of HR(6peak) as a simple alternative method to individualize exercise prescriptions in this population. Further studies are needed in a larger cohort of patients to confirm these preliminary findings.",M2
20379044,"Systolic blood pressure response to exercise as a predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure.It is well known that peak oxygen consumption and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) recovery after exercise obtained from the cardiopulmonary exercise test are prognostic parameters in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). However, it is unclear whether exercise-induced parameters obtained from the routine exercise stress test predict mortality in patients with CHF. We studied 136 patients (93 males/43 females) with CHF. All patients underwent symptom-limited exercise stress testing. Exercise parameters included exercise duration, exercise-induced HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and metabolic equivalents (METs). During the follow-up period (mean 6.2 years), 34 patients died. Survival rates at the 3rd and 5th years were 90% and 83%, respectively. Body mass index was significantly smaller in the nonsurvival group than in the survival group (P &lt; 0.01). The incidence of patients with New York Heart Association III class was higher in the nonsurvival group than in the survival group (P &lt; 0.05). In univariate analysis, predictors of mortality included peak HR and SBP, increases in HR and SBP during exercise, HR and SBP at the 1st minute after exercise, HR at the 3rd minute after exercise, and METs. The use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents was not associated with prognosis. In Cox hazard model analysis, the increase in SBP (P &lt; 0.002), HR at the 3rd minute after exercise (P &lt; 0.05), and METs (P &lt; 0.05) were independent predictors of mortality. SBP response to exercise, HR recovery after exercise, and METs obtained from the routine exercise test predicted mortality in patients with CHF irrespective of the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents.",M2
20370783,"Cardiovascular and metabolic effects of high-dose insulin in a porcine septic shock model.OBJECTIVES: High-dose insulin (HDI) has inotropic and vasodilatory properties in various clinical conditions associated with myocardial depression. The authors hypothesized that HDI will improve the myocardial depression produced by severe septic shock and have beneficial effects on metabolic parameters. In an animal model of severe septic shock, this study compared the effects of HDI treatment to normal saline (NS) resuscitation alone. METHODS: Ten pigs were randomized to an insulin (HDI) or NS group. All were anesthetized and instrumented to monitor cardiovascular function. In both arms, Escherichia coli endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and NS infusions were begun. LPS was titrated to 20 mug/kg/hour over 30 minutes and continued for 5 hours, and saline was infused at 20 mL/kg/hour throughout the protocol. Dextrose (50%) was infused to maintain glucose in the 60-150 mg/dL range, and potassium was infused to maintain a level greater than 2.8 mmol/L. At 60 minutes, the HDI group received an insulin infusion titrated from 2 to 10 units/kg/hour over 40 minutes and continued at that rate throughout the protocol. Survival, heart rate (<e>HR</e>), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary artery and central venous pressure, cardiac output, central venous oxygen saturation (SVO(2)), and lactate were monitored for 5 hours (three pigs each arm) or 7 hours (two pigs each arm) or until death. Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), O(2) delivery, and O(2) consumption were derived from measured data. Outcomes from the repeated-measures analysis were modeled using a mixed-effects linear model that assumed normally distributed errors and a random effect at the subject level. RESULTS: No significant baseline differences existed between arms at time 0 or 60 minutes. Survival was 100% in the HDI arm and 60% in the NS arm. Cardiovascular variables were significantly better in the HDI arm: cardiac index (p &lt; 0.001), SVR (p &lt; 0.003), and PVR (p &lt; 0.01). The metabolic parameters were also significantly better in the HDI arm: SVO(2) (p &lt; 0.01), O(2) delivery (p &lt; 0.001), and O(2) consumption (p &lt; 0.001). No differences in MAP, HR, or lactate were found. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model of endotoxemic-induced septic shock that results in severe myocardial depression, HDI is associated with improved cardiac function compared to NS resuscitation alone. HDI also demonstrated favorable metabolic, pulmonary, and peripheral vascular effects. Further studies may define a potential role for the use of HDI in the resuscitation of septic shock.",M2
20370466,"Time-dependent inhibitory effect of lipopolysaccharide injection on Per1 and Per2 gene expression in the mouse heart and liver.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a pathogen-associated large molecule responsible for sepsis-related endotoxic shock, and the heart is one of the most common organs adversely affected. LPS is reported to increase serum TNFalpha levels and reduce Per1 and Per2 gene expression. Therefore, in this experiment, we determined the time-dependent effects of LPS on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and circadian gene expression in the mouse heart and liver. HR of the LPS group was significantly elevated 2 and 8 h after injection compared to the control group. A significant percent increase in HR was observed at ZT6, 12, and 18. LPS increased Tnfalpha mRNA expression in the heart and liver at ZT6, 18, and 24. A time-dependent effect of LPS on reduction of Per1 and Per2 gene expression was also observed in the heart and liver. In order to examine the effect of LPS on cell damage, we examined apoptosis-related gene expression after LPS injection. Bax mRNA expression level of the LPS group was higher than that of the control group 8 and 26 h after injection. On the other hand, Bcl2 mRNA expression level of the LPS group was lower than that of the control group 2 and 26 h after injection. Dexamethasone strongly attenuated the LPS-induced increase of serum TNFalpha without significant change in Per1 and Per2 gene expression in the heart. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that LPS exerts a time-dependent inhibitory effect on Per1 and Per2 gene expression in the heart and liver. The chronopharmacological lethal effect of LPS may be related to the time-dependent increase of serum TNFalpha level and simultaneously high level of Per2 gene expression in the heart and liver between ZT12-18. Taken together, chronopharmacological effect of LPS may be related to not only sickness behavior syndrome and mortality, but also circadian rhythm systems.",M2
20369608,"[Ventricular extrasystole in patients with metabolic syndrome]The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of ventricular extrasystole in patients developing metabolic syndrome. 24 hour echoCG monitoring was performed in 112 subjects above 15 yr meeting AHA/NHILBI 2005 criteria for metabolic syndrome corrected for the European population and in 107 metabolically neutral subjects. Significant differences were documented in the frequency of polytopic extrasystole (63.4 vs 46.2%; p = 0.01), morphology number (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs 2.3 +/- 0.7; p = 0.02), frequency of paired/group extrasystole (31.2 vs 18.7%; p = 0.02), number of extrasystoles in the longest chain (8.5 +/- 3.1 vs 3.7 +/- 2.2; p = 0.04). Strong (r &lt; 0.5) positive correlation between the mean heart rate (<e>HR</e>) per 1 hour and the number of paired/group extrasystoles proved a highly specific sign of metabolic syndrome (100 and 89.5% respectively). Patients with metabolic syndrome more frequently had polytopic/group ventricular extrasystole associated with elevated mean HR.",M2
20364879,"Autonomic, behavioral, and neural analyses of mild conditioned negative affect in marmosets.Avoidance and alerting behaviors and accompanying physiological responses, including changes in heart rate (<e>HR</e>), are core components of negative emotion. Investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying the regulation and integration of these responses require animal models that simultaneously measure both the physiological and behavioral components of emotion. A primate model is of particular importance in view of the well developed prefrontal cortex of primates, and this region's critical role in emotion regulation and the etiology of affective disorders. Therefore, we have developed a simple aversive conditioning paradigm to assess, simultaneously, cardiovascular and behavioral responses in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Validation of the paradigm was achieved by (1) comparing conditioned responses to a predictive cue with pseudoconditioned responses to a nonpredictive cue; (2) assessing the acquisition of conditioning following lesions of the amygdala, a region essential for associative learning in humans and rats; and (3) determining the contributions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system to the conditioned autonomic responses. Marmosets acquired conditioned HR and behavioral responses in the conditioned, but not the pseudoconditioned or amygdala lesioned groups. Conditioned HR accelerations were reduced by both parasympathetic and sympathetic blockade. Thus, a model of associative learning of mild negative emotion in the marmoset has been validated by psychological, neurological, and pharmacological investigation. Future studies will determine the role of the prefrontal cortex in the regulation of these negative emotional responses, to provide insights into the neuropathology of affective disorders.",M2
20354006,"Autonomic nervous system state: the effect of general anaesthesia and bilateral tonsillectomy after unilateral infiltration of lidocaine.BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) sensitively responds to intraoperative stress. Several indices characterizing the state and responses of autonomic signs to nociceptive stimuli have been introduced. This study evaluated the behaviour of ANS descriptors after induction, before and during tracheal intubation, and during bilateral tonsillectomies after random and blinded unilateral infiltration of lidocaine 1% until emergence from anaesthesia. METHODS: Twelve patients undergoing bilateral tonsillectomy were anaesthetized with fentanyl and propofol (induction) and sevoflurane (maintenance). All patients were monitored throughout anaesthesia for middle finger temperature, non-invasive arterial pressure, heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and pulse rate (PR), state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE), and surgical pleth index (SPI). New parameters complementing the above and characterizing the ANS state (ANSS) and responses are pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI), pulse plethysmographic amplitude (PPGA), ANSS, and an index based on maximal ANSS for the subject (ANSSI). Serial data were stored as 10 s averages into a laptop computer. RESULTS: Anaesthesia induction was associated with an increase in finger temperature to &gt;30 degrees C within 10 min, whereas PPGA increased to their maximum levels within 5 min. Laryngoscopy and intubation were associated with transient autonomic responses in most patients. All autonomic signs indicated statistically significant sympathetic activation during saline-infiltrated tonsillectomies when compared with lidocaine-infiltrated sides (P&lt;0001). Hypnotic measures (SE and RE) and finger temperatures did not differ between the sides. CONCLUSIONS: HR, PPI, PPGA, ANSS, ANSSI, SPI, and RE-SE detect autonomic responses to nociceptive stimuli and differentiate between tonsillectomies on locally anaesthetized tonsils from controls.",M2
20349660,"Hematocrit, systolic blood pressure and heart rate are not accurate predictors for surgery to control hemorrhage in injured patients.Hematocrit (Hct), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) are considered to closely correlate with hypovolemia in injured patients. The clinical importance of these parameters in the early recognition of occult but clinically significant hemorrhage remains to be demonstrated. We undertook this study to assess the clinical importance of these parameters in the early recognition of occult hemorrhage in injured patients. A retrospective study of 7880 patients admitted to a Level I trauma center was carried out. Patients who underwent surgery were divided into the hemorrhage (n = 160) and no-hemorrhage group (n = 228). Hematocrit, SBP, and HR were correlated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. The ROC curves for Hct, SBP, and HR showed suboptimal areas under the graph. Even for different Hct thresholds and for hypotension and tachycardia, low predictive values were found. Although Hct, SBP, and HR levels were significantly altered among patients who require surgery for hemorrhage, the low predictive values of each parameter renders them as clinically unreliable individual tools for recognition of hemorrhagic patients who need surgery. Although useful in aggregate, as a pattern, or as indications for further diagnostic studies, these common parameters have limited usefulness individually.",M2
20348220,"The heart rate response to spontaneous arousal from sleep is reduced in children with Down syndrome referred for evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing.Arousal from sleep in healthy adults is associated with a large, transient increase in heart rate (<e>HR</e>). Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have attenuated cardiovascular responses to autonomic tests during wakefulness. We tested the hypothesis that the HR response to arousal from sleep is reduced in children with DS and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) compared with healthy children. Twenty children aged 3-17 yr referred for investigation of sleep-disordered breathing (10 DS, and 10 OSA controls) matched for age and obstructive apnea/hypopnea index underwent routine overnight polysomnography. In addition, 10 nonsnoring controls from the general community were studied. Beat-by-beat HR was analyzed from 15 s pre- to 15 s post-spontaneous arousals and compared between groups using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Data are presented as means + or - SE. For both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM), arousals were associated with a significant increase in HR in all groups (peak response NREM: DS, 118 + or - 1% at 3 s; OSA controls, 124 + or - 2% at 4 s; and healthy controls, 125 + or - 3% at 4 s; and peak response REM: DS, 116 + or - 2% at 4 s; OSA controls, 123 + or - 3% at 4 s; and healthy controls, 125 + or - 4 at 4 s; P &lt; 0.001 for all). Post hoc analysis revealed that HR in the DS group was significantly lower than both control groups at 1-4 s in NREM and at 4 to 5 s in REM (P &lt; 0.05 for all). In conclusion, the HR response to spontaneous arousal from sleep is reduced in children with DS and OSA compared with healthy children. This attenuated cardiovascular response could be due to reduced sympathetic activation or blunted vagal withdrawal and may have implications for the child with DS and OSA.",M2
20346304,"Usefulness of heart rate at rest as a predictor of mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with stable coronary heart disease (Data from the Treating to New Targets [TNT] trial).The heart rate at rest (<e>HR</e>) is a predictor of cardiovascular (CV) mortality. However, its effect on nonfatal CV events is unknown. The aim of the present post hoc analysis of the Treating New Targets (TNT) trial was to assess the effect of the HR at rest on major CV events in patients with stable coronary heart disease. A total of 9,580 subjects were included in the present analysis and were followed up for a median of 4.9 years. The rate of major CV events was 11.9% in those with a baseline HR of &gt; or =70 beats/min versus 8.8% in those with a baseline HR of &lt;70 beats/min. An increased HR at rest was associated with CV events, even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.16 for every 10-beats/min increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 1.23, p &lt;0.0001; adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 per 10-beats/min increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16, p = 0.018). A HR &gt; or =70 beats/min was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.71, p = 0.001) and heart failure hospitalization (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.95, p &gt; or =0.0001). However, this association was not observed for stroke or myocardial infarction (p = 0.11 and p = 0.68, respectively). In conclusion, in patients with stable coronary heart disease, every 10-beats/min increase in the HR at rest was associated with an 8% increase in major CV events. In particular, a HR at rest of &gt; or =70 beats/min was associated with a 40% increased risk of all-cause mortality and more than doubled the risk of heart failure hospitalization, but not the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction.",M2
20334676,"Feasibility of real-time three-dimensional stress echocardiography: pharmacological and semi-supine exercise.BACKGROUND: Real time three dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography is an accurate and reproducible method for assessing left ventricular shape and function. AIM: assess the feasibility and reproducibility of RT3D stress echocardiography (SE) (exercise and pharmacological) in the evaluation of left ventricular function compared to 2D. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease underwent 2D and RT3DSE. The agreement in WMSI, EDV, ESV measurements was made off-line.The feasibility of RT-3DSE was 67%. The inter-observer variability for WMSI by RT3D echo was higher during exercise and with suboptimal quality images (good: k = 0.88; bad: k = 0.69); and with high heart rate both for pharmacological (<e>HR</e> &lt; 100 bpm, k = 0.83; HR &gt; or = 100 bpm, k = 0.49) and exercise SE (HR &lt; 120 bpm, k = 0.88; HR &gt; or = 120 bpm, k = 0.78). The RT3D reproducibility was high for ESV volumes (0.3 +/- 14 ml; CI 95%: -27 to 27 ml; p = n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: RT3DSE is more vulnerable than 2D due to tachycardia, signal quality, patient decubitus and suboptimal resting image quality, making exercise RT3DSE less attractive than pharmacological stress.",M2
20305314,"The influence of cardiac rhythm type and frequency on the prognosis of severe heart failure patients initially qualified for heart transplantation.BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia among patients (pts) with heart failure and has significant influence on survival. AIM OF THE STUDY: to assess prognosis of pts with refractory heart failure (HF) qualified for heart transplantation (HTX). MATERIAL/METHODS: 872 pts (107 W and 765 M) were qualified for HTX between Dec 2003 and Oct 2007. Patient's death or super urgent heart transplantation were considered the end point in Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: 680 pts were on sinus rhythm (SR) and 192(22.0%) had atrial fibrillation (AF). During follow-up (1-1464 days, mean 550 days) 155 pts (17.7%) died, 17.65% with SR and 18.23% with AF (ns). EF - mean 21,6 (SR) and 21,8 (FA), NYHA 3,1 (SR), NTproBNP- mean 3635, 4 (SR) and 4349,4 (FA), Arronson - mean 7,8 (SR) and 7,7 (FA). There were no significant differences between groups. We analyzed influence of heart rate (Kaplan-Maier method) on survival. The pts were divided according to <e>HR</e>: gr.I &lt;70/min, gr II 71-89/min, gr III &gt;90/min. The shortest survival rate was noticed in group III. There was no difference in survival between group I and II. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients qualified for heart transplant does not depend on the type of the dominant cardiac rhythm (atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm). The prognosis is significantly better for those patients whose basic, resting heart rate does not exceed 90 bpm regardless of the rhythm type.",M2
20300022,"Oxygen cost of kettlebell swings.In recent years, kettlebells have re-emerged as a popular training modality for the conditioning of athletes. We sought to quantify the aerobic challenge of one popularly recommended kettlebell workout. Ten college-aged men (age = 20.8 +/- 1.1 years, height = 179 +/- 3 cm, body mass = 77.3 +/- 7.7 kg, Vo2max = 52.78 +/- 6.22 ml.kg.min) completed a graded exercise test to exhaustion for the determination of Vo2max. Two to 7 days later, subjects completed a kettlebell exercise routine consisting of as many 2-handed swings as could be completed in 12 minutes using a 16-kg kettlebell. During this exercise bout, subjects' expired gases were collected and analyzed for the determination of Vo2, and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) was continuously measured. Percent HRmax and Vo2max achieved during the kettlebell exercise were compared with each other using a paired t-test. Subjects completed 265 +/- 68 swings during the 12 minutes and achieved an average Vo2 of 34.31 +/- 5.67 ml.kg.min and an average HR of 165 +/- 13 b.min. The average %HRmax (86.8 +/- 6.0%) during kettlebell exercise was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than the average Vo2max (65.3 +/- 9.8%) that was achieved. Continuous kettlebell swings can impart a metabolic challenge of sufficient intensity to increase Vo2max. Heart rate was substantially higher than Vo2 during kettlebell swings. Kettlebells provide a useful tool with which coaches may improve the cardiorespiratory fitness of their athletes. However, HRs achieved during continuous kettlebell exercise are significantly higher than actual Vo2.",M2
20300019,"The effect of a traditional dance training program on the physical fitness of adults with hearing loss.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a traditional dance training program on aerobic capacity and muscle strength of adults with hearing loss. Twenty-three adults with hearing loss were separated into 2 groups. Thirteen subjects (6 men, 7 women, mean age, 25.7 +/- 3.9 years) constituted the intervention group, whereas 10 subjects (5 men, 5 women, mean age, 26.4 +/- 5.9 years) formed the control group. Pretraining and posttraining treadmill tests were performed to determine heart rate (<e>HR</e> peak), peak minute ventilation (VE peak), peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak, absolute and relative), and time to exhaustion (min). Peak torque of hamstring and quadriceps muscles at angular velocities of 60 degrees /s, 180 degrees /s, and 300 degrees /s was also measured. The intervention group followed a 12-week traditional dance training program, whereas the control group received no training during this period. Repeated measures of multiple analyses of variance were used to test mean differences between the values of both groups. A paired t-test was used to compare the values within each group prior and after program participation. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all tests. Following the 12-week training program, significant improvements in peak physiological parameters were seen for the intervention group for peak minute ventilation, peak oxygen consumption (both absolute and relative), time to exhaustion, and peak torque values between the 2 measurements (initial and final). No significant improvements in peak physiological parameters and peak torque were noticed in the control group. In conclusion, adults with hearing loss can improve their physical fitness levels with the application of a systematic and well-designed traditional dance training program.",M2
20230560,"Cardiopulmonary and isoflurane-sparing effects of epidural or intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine in cats undergoing surgery with epidural lidocaine.OBJECTIVE: To compare the cardiorespiratory, anesthetic-sparing effects and quality of anesthetic recovery after epidural and constant rate intravenous (IV) infusion of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in cats given a low dose of epidural lidocaine under propofol-isoflurane anesthesia and submitted to elective ovariohysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, blinded clinical trial. ANIMALS: Twenty-one adult female cats (mean body weight: 3.1 +/- 0.4 kg). METHODS: Cats received DEX (4 microg kg(-1), IM). Fifteen minutes later, anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Cats were divided into three groups. In GI cats received epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1), n = 7), in GII cats were given epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1)) + DEX (4 microg kg(-1), n = 7), and in GIII cats were given epidural lidocaine (1 mg kg(-1)) + IV constant rate infusion (CRI) of DEX (0.25 microg kg(-1) minute(-1), n = 7). Variables evaluated included heart rate (<e>HR</e>), respiratory rate (f(R)), systemic arterial pressures, rectal temperature (RT), end-tidal CO(2), end-tidal isoflurane concentration (e'ISO), arterial blood gases, and muscle tone. Anesthetic recovery was compared among groups by evaluation of times to recovery, HR, f(R), RT, and degree of analgesia. A paired t-test was used to evaluate pre-medication variables and blood gases within groups. anova was used to compare parametric data, whereas Friedman test was used to compare muscle relaxation. RESULTS: Epidural and CRI of DEX reduced HR during anesthesia maintenance. Mean +/- SD e'ISO ranged from 0.86 +/- 0.28% to 1.91 +/- 0.63% in GI, from 0.70 +/- 0.12% to 0.97 +/- 0.20% in GII, and from 0.69 +/- 0.12% to 1.17 +/- 0.25% in GIII. Cats in GII and GIII had longer recovery periods than in GI. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Epidural and CRI of DEX significantly decreased isoflurane consumption and resulted in recovery of better quality and longer duration, despite bradycardia, without changes in systemic blood pressure.",M2
20230558,"Cardiovascular effects following epidural injection of romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cardiovascular effects of epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded experiment. ANIMALS: A total of six healthy adult female Beagles aged 1.25 +/- 0.08 years and weighing 12.46 +/- 1.48 (10.25-14.50) kg. METHODS: Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (6-9 mg kg(-1)) and maintained with 1.8-1.9% end-tidal isoflurane in oxygen. End-tidal CO(2) was kept between 35 and 45 mmHg (4.7-6.0 kPa) using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>), arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) were monitored. Cardiac output was determined using a LiDCO monitor and the derived parameters were calculated. After baseline measurements, either 10 microg kg(-1) romifidine or saline (total volume 1 mL 4.5 kg(-1)) was injected into the lumbosacral epidural space. Data were recorded for 1 hour after epidural injection. A minimum of 1 week elapsed between treatments. RESULTS: After epidural injection, the overall means (+/- standard deviation, SD) of HR (95 +/- 20 bpm), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (81 +/- 19 mmHg), CO (1.63 +/- 0.66 L minute(-1)), cardiac index (CI) (2.97 +/- 1.1 L minute(-1) m(-2)) and stroke volume index (SI) (1.38 +/- 0.21 mL beat(-1) kg(-1)) were significantly lower in the romifidine treatment compared with the overall means in the saline treatment [HR (129 +/- 24 bpm), MAP (89 +/- 17 mmHg), CO (3.35 +/- 0.86 L minute(-1)), CI (6.17 +/- 1.4 L minute(-1) m(-2)) and SI (2.21 +/- 0.21 mL beat(-1) kg(-1))]. The overall mean of systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (7202 +/- 2656 dynes seconds cm(-5) m(-2)) after epidural romifidine injection was significantly higher than the overall mean of SVRI (3315 +/- 1167 dynes seconds cm(-5) m(-2)) after epidural saline injection. CONCLUSION: Epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs caused significant cardiovascular effects similar to those reportedly produced by systemic romifidine administration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Similar cardiovascular monitoring is required after epidural and systemically administered romifidine. Further studies are required to evaluate the analgesic effects of epidural romifidine.",M2
20230092,"Naturalistic monitoring of the affect-heart rate relationship: a day reconstruction study.OBJECTIVE: Prospective studies have linked negative affect with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. This study aims to identify if cardiovascular activity in day-to-day settings is related to affect levels as assessed using the Day Reconstruction Method (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &amp; Stone, 2004). DESIGN: 186 people underwent baseline physiological testing and were monitored naturalistically for an entire day. Multilevel models were the principal analyses used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We utilized an online day reconstruction survey to produce a continuous account of affect, social interactions, and activity patterns during waking hours. Ambulatory heart rate (<e>HR</e>) was assessed during the same period. Personality, health behavior, consumption, self-reported activity, and baseline physiological characteristics were assessed to isolate the relationships between affect and HR. RESULTS: Negative affect predicted an elevated ambulatory HR and tiredness predicted a lower HR. Associations between negative affectivity and increased cardiovascular reactivity were maintained after taking account of baseline physiological factors, health behavior, and personality. CONCLUSION: Negative affect in everyday life is a reliable predictor of HR. Combining day reconstruction with psychophysiological and environmental monitoring is a minimally invasive method with promising interdisciplinary relevance.",M2
20227547,"Effect of low-dose combined oral contraceptive on aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold level in active and sedentary young women.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term use of oral contraceptives (OC) containing 0.20 mg of ethinylestradiol (EE) combined with 0.15 mg of gestodene (GEST) on the peak aerobic capacity and at the anaerobic threshold (AT) level in active and sedentary young women. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-eight women (23+/-2.1 years old) were divided into four groups - active-OC (G1), active-NOC (G2), sedentary-OC (G3) and sedentary-NOC (G4) - and were submitted to a continuous ergospirometric incremental test on a cycloergometer with 20 to 25 W min(-1) increments. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. Level of significance was set at 5%. RESULTS: The OC use effect for the variables relative and absolute oxygen uptake VO(2) mL kg-(1) min(-1); VO(2), L min(-1), respectively), carbon dioxide output (VCO(2), L min(-1)), ventilation (VE, L min(-1)), heart rate (<e>HR</e>, bpm), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and power output (W) data, as well as the interaction between OC use and exercise effect on the peak of test and at the AT level did not differ significantly between the active groups (G1 and G2) and the sedentary groups (G3 and G4). As to the exercise effect, for all variables studied, it was noted that the active groups presented higher values for the variables VO(2), VCO(2), VE and power output (p&lt;.05) than the sedentary groups. The RER and HR were similar (p&gt;.05) at the peak and at the AT level between G1 vs. G3 and G2 vs. G4. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of OC containing EE 0.20 mg plus GEST 0.15 mg does not affect aerobic capacity at the peak and at the AT level of exercise tests.",M2
20074442,"Using cardiovascular parameters and symptom severity to prescribe physical activity in women with fibromyalgia.OBJECTIVES: This study has two main aims, firstly to define subgroups of women affected by fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) based on symptoms and secondly to determine cardiovascular parameters in treadmill exercises in order to prescribe physical activity. METHODS: Thirty-two women (age= 53.26+/-6.61 yr) were assigned to two different groups based on their functional capacity and symptoms as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and pain. Subjects were submitted twice to a maximum treadmill incremental test until participants achieved volitional exhaustion (VO2max). Expired respiratory gases, ventilator parameters and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) were measured continuously through exercise, and rate perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed once a minute during the test. RESULTS: Peak VO2 values for the moderately affected group (Group 1) were significantly different from those of severely affected group (Group 2) (26.2+/-2.1 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (Group 1) and 22.1+/-2.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (Group 2)). Additionally taking into account VO2 at ventilatory threshold (VO2VT), significant differences between groups were found in both tests. Some notable differences in all parameters evaluated were also found. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the aerobic capacity of patients with FMS was different according to how severely affected they were by the condition; therefore, physical activity of the same intensity should not be prescribed for both groups. According to these results, health professionals could prescribe physical activity with confidence to this patient group.",M2
20211328,"Blunting of the heart rate response to adenosine and regadenoson in relation to hyperglycemia and the metabolic syndrome.Adenosine and regadenoson cause an increase in heart rate (<e>HR</e>) during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). It has been shown that patients with diabetes mellitus have a blunted HR response due to cardiac autonomic dysfunction. It is not known whether the HR response is related to hyperglycemia and the metabolic syndrome (MS). HR changes were assessed in 2,000 patients (643 with diabetes mellitus [DM]) in the Adenoscan Versus Regadenoson Comparative Evaluation for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE MPI 2) trials in relation to MS status and blood sugar level on the day of MPI. The HR response was lower in patients with MS (32.43 +/- 0.52% vs 36.15 +/- 0.71%, p &lt;0.001). An increase in the number of features of MS was associated with a stepwise decrease in the HR response (-0.92% per MS criterion, p &lt;0.05), irrespective of the presence of DM. Increasing blood sugar levels resulted in blunting of the HR response even after controlling for DM and MS (0.60 +/- 0.08% per 10 mg/dl, p &lt;0.001). MS was independently related to the HR response on top of DM, renal function, left ventricular function, gender, age, baseline HR, blood pressure, and beta-blocker use. The overall model was highly associated with the HR response (p &lt;0.001) and able to explain 30% of its variation. In conclusion, the HR response to adenosine and regadenoson is blunted in patients with hyperglycemia and in those with MS. These results suggest that factors that precede the development of DM may be associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and may help explain the contribution of hyperglycemia and MS to cardiovascular risk.",M2
20211317,"Evaluation of contraindications and efficacy of oral Beta blockade before computed tomographic coronary angiography.Multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA) image quality is inversely related to the heart rate (<e>HR</e>). As a result beta-blocking medication is routinely administered before investigation. In the present study, the use, contraindications, and efficacy of prescan beta blockade with regard to HR reduction and CTA image quality were assessed. In 537 patients referred for CTA, the baseline HR and blood pressure were measured on arrival, and contraindications for beta blockade were noted. Unless contraindicated, a single dose of metoprolol was administered orally 1 hour before data acquisition in patients with a HR of &gt; or =65 beats/min according to a predefined medication protocol. After 1 hour, the HR was remeasured. A total of 283 patients (53%) had a HR of &gt; or =65 beats/min. In this group, beta blockade was contraindicated in 46 patients (16%). Metoprolol was administered to the remaining 237 patients. However, 26 patients (11%) received suboptimal (lower dose than prescribed by protocol) beta blockade because of contraindications. Of the 211 patients receiving optimal beta blockade, 57 (27%) did not achieve the target HR. Of the patients with contraindications to beta blockade, 43 (60%) did not achieve the target HR. Compared to patients with optimal HR control, those receiving no or suboptimal beta blockade because of contraindications had significantly fewer examinations of good image quality (40% vs 74%, p &lt;0.001), and significantly more examinations of poor image quality (20% vs 6%, p &lt;0.001). In conclusion, most patients require HR reduction before CTA. Contraindications to beta blockade are present in a substantial proportion of patients. This results in suboptimal HR control and image quality, indicating the need for alternative approaches for HR reduction.",M2
20207815,"Mechanisms of ventricular rate adaptation as a predictor of arrhythmic risk.Protracted QT interval (QTI) adaptation to abrupt heart rate (<e>HR</e>) changes has been identified as a clinical arrhythmic risk marker. This study investigates the ionic mechanisms of QTI rate adaptation and its relationship to arrhythmic risk. Computer simulations and experimental recordings in human and canine ventricular tissue were used to investigate the ionic basis of QTI and action potential duration (APD) to abrupt changes in HR with a protocol commonly used in clinical studies. The time for 90% QTI adaptation is 3.5 min in simulations, in agreement with experimental and clinical data in humans. APD adaptation follows similar dynamics, being faster in mid-myocardial cells (2.5 min) than in endocardial and epicardial cells (3.5 min). Both QTI and APD adapt in two phases following an abrupt HR change: a fast initial phase with time constant &lt; 30 s, mainly related to L-type calcium and slow-delayed rectifier potassium current, and a second slow phase of &gt;2 min driven by intracellular sodium concentration ([Na(+)](i)) dynamics. Alterations in [Na(+)](i) dynamics due to Na(+)/K(+) pump current inhibition result in protracted rate adaptation and are associated with increased proarrhythmic risk, as indicated by action potential triangulation and faster L-type calcium current recovery from inactivation, leading to the formation of early afterdepolarizations. In conclusion, this study suggests that protracted QTI adaptation could be an indicator of altered [Na(+)](i) dynamics following Na(+)/K(+) pump inhibition as it occurs in patients with ischemia or heart failure. An increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with protracted rate adaptation may be due to an increased risk of early after-depolarization formation.",M2
20204841,"Effects of oral single-dose administration of sarpogrelate hydrochloride on saturation O(2) of calf muscle during plantar flexion exercise.To investigate the effects of a 100-mg oral single-dose administration of sarpogrelate hydrochloride (SH) on saturation O(2) (StO(2)) of calf muscle in healthy subjects experiencing simulated peripheral arterial disease (0.6 ankle brachial pressure index). Ten subjects performed three kinds of plantar flexion exercises at a work rate of 50% of maximal volunteer contraction for 4 min by using cuff occlusion ischemia,. Subjects performed a control test (C) without ischemia and SH, an ischemia test (I) without SH, and an I + SH test with ischemia. StO(2), blood pressures (BP), and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) were measured through all experiments. At the end of the exercise, the decrease in StO(2) from baseline in the C and I + SH tests was significantly less than that in the I test (p &lt; 0.05, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in mean BP or HR in any of the exercise conditions. These results indicated that an oral single-dose administration of SH might improve peripheral circulation independent of any changes in BP and HR.",M2
20204812,"Arterial oxygen desaturation response to repeated bouts of sprint exercise in healthy young women.The decline in arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin during exercise has been termed exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH). We examined whether repeated bouts of sprint exercise (SprE) would induce EIAH in healthy young men and women. Ten men and 11 women (20.4 +/- 0.3 year) performed an anaerobic power test (three bouts of 10 s cycling with 120 s intervals) using a cycle ergometer. Arterial oxygen saturation of hemoglobin measured by pulse oximeter (SpO(2)), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), rate perceived exertion (RPE), and the blood lactate concentration ([La](b)) were assessed at rest, during, and 5 min after repeated bouts of SprE. Women exhibited a lower maximal anaerobic power (MAnP) compared to men (498 +/- 23 vs. 759 +/- 22 watts, respectively, p &lt; 0.01). HR, RPE, and [La](b) in women were comparable with those in men throughout the test. However, the only significant decline in SpO(2) after a single bout of SprE (95.5 +/- 0.7%) from the resting value (97.9 +/- 0.2%) was observed in women, and further declines occurred following heavier SprE (&lt; 95%). In 8 of 11 women, mild to moderate EIAH developed, whereas only 2 men showed mild EIAH. Thus, these findings suggest that repeated bouts of SprE might induce mild EIAH in young women but not men.",M2

METHODS: Based on the statistic variable random sampling principal, we selected 1903 healthy adult females with ages of 18 - 70 years old in Heilongjiang province to conduct the study. The height, body weight, waist, chest measurement and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were measured. Body components quota including fat weight, lean weight, percentage of body fat (PBF) were taken respectively; systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), stroke index (SI), left cardiac work (LCW) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were determined. RESULTS: The PBF and WHR increased with aging, and the PBF of those with ages of 18-, 30-, 40-, 50- and 60 - 70 year's old were (16.86 +/- 5.37)%, (18.43 +/- 4.89)%, (20.99 +/- 5.79)%, (23.47 +/- 5.74)% and (25.77 +/- 6.38)%, respectively (F = 154.46, P &lt; 0.01); and the WHR were 0.77 +/- 0.05, 0.80 +/- 0.05, 0.83 +/- 0.05, 0.85 +/- 0.06 and 0.89 +/- 0.07, respectively (F = 229.84, P &lt; 0.01).

20190650,"Acute changes in heart rate variability in subjects with diabetes following a highway traffic exposure.OBJECTIVE: To pilot a protocol to evaluate acute cardiovascular effects in in-vehicle exposure to traffic air pollutants in people with diabetes. METHODS: Twenty-one volunteers with type 2 diabetes were passengers on 90- to 110-minute car rides on a busy highway. We measured in-vehicle particle number and mass (PM2.5) nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide and heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure. RESULTS: Compared with pre-ride measurements, we found a decrease in high frequency (HF) HRV from pre-ride to next day (ratio 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.93) and an increase in low frequency to HF ratio at post-ride (ratio 1.92, 95% CI = 1.21 to 3.05) at post-ride. Interquartile range increases in measured pollutants were associated with next-day decreases in <e>HR</e> HRV.

20190351,"Higher fat oxidation in running than cycling at the same exercise intensities.This study examined the differences in fat and carbohydrate oxidation during running and cycling at the same relative exercise intensities, with intensity determined in a number of ways. Specifically, exercise intensity was expressed as a percentage of maximum workload (WL(max)), maximum oxygen uptake (%VO(2max)), and maximum heart rate (%<e>HR</e>(max)) and as rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Ten male triathletes performed maximal running and cycling trials and subsequently exercised at 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, and 80% of their WL(max). VO(2), HR, RPE, and plasma lactate concentrations were measured during all submaximal trials. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation were calculated from VO(2) and VCO(2) data. A 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures was used to determine any statistically significant differences between exercise modes. Fat oxidation was shown to be significantly higher in running than in cycling at the same relative intensities expressed as either %WL(max) or %VO(2max). Neither were there any significant differences in VO(2max) and HR(max) between the 2 exercise modes, nor in submaximal VO(2) or RPE between the exercise modes at the same %WL(max). However, heart rate and plasma lactate concentrations were significantly higher when cycling at 60% and 65% and 65-80%WL(max), respectively. In conclusion, fat oxidation is significantly higher during running than during cycling at the same relative intensity expressed as either %WL(max) or %VO(2max).",M2
20190125,"Cortisol is significantly correlated with cardiovascular responses during high levels of stress in critical care personnel.OBJECTIVE: Everyday stressors elicit adaptive changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system. Data on the relationship between these two systems under real-life conditions are sparse. We, therefore, sought to examine the association between HRV and salivary cortisol, which were recorded simultaneously in a stress-exposed, prospective, occupational cohort. METHODS: The study population comprised 88 nurses. We recorded heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and HRV during 301 working shifts. Participants provided salivary cortisol samples at the beginning of their work shift and every 2 hours thereafter. Samples were collected during three investigation periods spread over 9 months. Change scores for cortisol were calculated as deviations from the expected circadian baseline. Change scores from the grand diurnal mean in the time domain-based root mean square of successive differences served to index alterations in HRV. To account for the temporal delay between changes in HR/HRV and changes in salivary cortisol, the latter were compared with the changes in HR/HRV observed 15 minutes to 45 minutes before the cortisol sampling. RESULTS: During periods of high stress as indexed by high cortisol levels, we found significant associations between cortisol levels and HR (r = .48, p &lt; .001) and HRV (r = -.28, p = .05). However, during low stress periods, these associations were attenuated and became nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a relative independence in the regulation of the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system in response to everyday stressors but synchrony of both systems in highly stressful situations.",M2
20187285,"Intermittent versus constant aerobic exercise: effects on arterial stiffness.Aerobic exercises (of sufficient duration and intensity) decreases arterial stiffness. However, the direct relationship between the type of aerobic exercise (i.e. constant versus interval) and the alteration in arterial stiffness has been poorly explored. We evaluated the hemodynamic responses of 11 healthy males (22.5 +/- 0.7 years, height 177.7 +/- 1.1 cm, body mass 70.5 +/- 2.4 kg) following acute constant (CE) and intermittent cycling exercise (IE). Exercise duration and intensity (mean heart rate) were matched during both exercises (142.9 +/- 2.4 bpm for CE and 144.2 +/- 2.4 bpm for IE). Heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and cardiac output (CO) were measured throughout the whole session, while blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured during pre exercise and 30 min recovery. Arterial stiffness and cardiac autonomic control were assessed through PWV and heart rate variability, respectively. After IE, lower limb arterial stiffness was significantly and steadily decreased compared to pre exercise value (from 8.6 +/- 0.1 to m s(-1) to 7.6 +/- 0.3 to m s(-1) at 30 min) and was lower than after CE (8.2 +/- 0.3 m s(-1) at 30 min, which did not significantly change compared to pre exercise: 8.7 +/- 0.2 m s(-1)). We hypothesized that the higher HR and lower arterial stiffness after IE were likely due to variations in peripheral vascular changes during the exercise which may trigger the release of endothelial or metabolic vasoactive factors. These data appear to show that IE may result in a greater stimulus for vascular adaptations when compared to CE.",M2

Mice may perceive rats as predators. Although one theory says this can cause stress, there is little scientific evidence to support this theory. In the wild, rats and mice usually do not share the same microhabitat, but this appears to be true for most small rodent species. Furthermore, reports of predatory behavior of rats toward mice mainly originate from experimental settings using rats with high inbred levels of aggression. This experiment measured heart rate (<e>HR</e>), body temperature (BT), activity (AC), and urinary corticosterone in female C57BL/6 mice before, during, and after introducing Wistar rats into their room. The study found no chronic effects of rat introduction on any parameters. The study concluded that housing rats and mice in the same room is at least less disturbing than cage cleaning, which caused a temporary increase of HR, BT, and AC. Current results do not support legislation based on compromised welfare.",M2
20181520,"Spectral analysis of heart rate variability reveals an enhanced sympathetic activity in narcolepsy with cataplexy.OBJECTIVE: To test the autonomic control of cardiovascular reflexes and heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and during orthostatic stress in narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC). METHODS: Ten NC patients with a hypocretin deficit and 18 control subjects underwent head-up tilt test (HUTT), Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing and cold face under controlled laboratory conditions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed during supine rest and HUTT considering the normalized unit of LF and HF power (LFnu; HFnu), using autoregressive (AR) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms. RESULTS: Cardiovascular changes during HUTT, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing, isometric handgrip and cold face were normal and comparable in the two groups. AR and FFT analysis showed an increased LF/HF ratio in NC patients during supine rest. As expected, LFnu increased and HFnu decreased in the control group during HUTT, but did not change in narcoleptics being comparable to values in the supine condition. CONCLUSIONS: NC patients showed an increased sympathetic drive on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) in the supine condition that did not further increase during HUTT. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest the proper functioning of cardiovascular reflexes in NC but support an impairment of HR modulation at rest in favour of an enhanced sympathetic activity.",M2
20177338,"Factors influencing outcome after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplantation in the United Kingdom: an evidence base for a new national kidney allocation policy.BACKGROUND: Outcomes after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplantation are good, but survival rates vary according to a number of donor-, recipient-, and transplant-related factors. This comprehensive analysis of transplant outcomes was undertaken to inform development of a new Kidney Allocation Scheme. METHODS: A complete case analysis of the outcome of kidney-only transplants in the United Kingdom, 1995 to 2001, was undertaken using Cox regression modeling. Seven thousand three hundred eighty-five (77%) of the 9585 transplants reported to the UK Transplant Registry were primary transplants in adults. Regrafts and pediatric patients (age &lt;18 years) were analyzed separately. Transplant and patient survival over 5 years were investigated in addition to causes of prolonged cold ischemia time (CIT). RESULTS: A variety of factors significantly adversely influenced kidney transplant and patient outcome, including older donor age, older recipient age, waiting time to transplant over 2 years, diabetes, and earlier year of transplant. Human leukocyte antigen mismatch and CIT were significant in analyses of transplant but not in patient outcome, and an increased graft failure rate was also identified in adolescent patients. CIT was prolonged by long-distance kidney exchanges between centers (2 <e>hr</e>) and reallocation of kidneys for alternative patients (7 hr). CONCLUSION: This study identified a number of factors that influence transplant outcome after deceased heart beating donor kidney transplant in the United Kingdom. The findings suggest that the influences of human leukocyte antigen mismatch and CIT are most relevant in considering a revised kidney allocation scheme.",M2
20173163,"Prospective analysis of the pattern and risk for severe vital sign changes during percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of the liver under opioid analgesia.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the pattern of vital sign changes and to elucidate significant risk factors for severe cardiovascular inhibition caused by percutaneous hepatic radiofrequency ablation (RFA). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 102 patients (male-to-female ratio, 73:29; age range, 35-85 years; mean age, 58.1 years) with 119 malignant hepatic tumors were enrolled and analyzed prospectively. The patients underwent percutaneous RFA with IV infusion of opioid analgesics. Changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and the occurrence of significant cardiovascular inhibition (BP or HR &lt; 70% of baseline) were monitored during the procedure. Respiratory rate and skin body temperature were recorded before and after the procedure. RESULTS: Whereas the mean BP was elevated (36%, 43/119) or depressed (36%, 43/119) with a similar frequency, the HR was predominantly depressed (56%, 66/119) during the procedure. The BP and HR were stable in only 18% cases (21/119), respectively. The respiratory rate showed no significant change (p = 0.521) after RFA; however, body temperature decreased (p &lt; 0.001) after RFA. Although significant cardiovascular inhibition occurred in 41 cases (35%), all of the cases could be managed successfully and the technical success rate was 100% (119/119). Among the risk factors analyzed, old age (B = -0.003, p = 0.019) was significant for systolic BP depression, and contact of the RFA zone with the central portal vein (B = -0.096, p = 0.014) and female sex (B = -0.078, p = 0.033) were significant risk factors for HR depression as determined by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Changes in BP and HR, especially bradycardia, are common during percutaneous RFA of hepatic lesions. Significant risk factors for severe cardiovascular inhibition include contact of the RFA zone with the branches of the central portal vein, old age, and female sex.",M2
20172287,"Evaluation of hemodynamic, metabolic, and electrolytic changes after graft reperfusion in a porcine model of intestinal transplantation.BACKGROUND: We sought to establish an anesthetic protocol to evaluate the hemodynamic, metabolic, and electrolytic changes after graft reperfusion in pigs undergoing orthotopic intestinal transplant (ITx). METHODS: Fifteen pigs were distributed into two groups: GI (n = 6), without immunosuppression, and GII (n = 9), immunosuppressed before surgery with tacrolimus (0.3 mg/kg). The animals were premedicated at 1 hour before surgery with IM acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg), morphine (0.4 mg/kg), ketamine (10 mg/kg), and atropine (0.044 mg/kg IM). Anesthesia induction used equal proportions of diazepam and ketamine (0.1-0.15 mL/kg/IV) and for maintenance in IV infusion of xylazine (1 mg/mL), ketamine (2 mg/mL), and guaiacol glyceryl ether 5% (50 mg/mL), diluted in 250 mL of 5% glucose solution. In addition, recipient pigs were treated with isofluorane inhalation. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>), systolic (SAP), mean (MAP), and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, respiratory frequency (f), capnography, body temperature (T), blood gas analysis (pH, Paco(2), Pao(2), base excess, BE; Hco(3)(-), Sato(2)), serum potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium, hematocrit (Hct), and glucose (Glu) were measured at four times; M0: after incision (basal value); M1: 10 minutes before reperfusion; and M2 and M3: 10 and 20 minutes after graft reperfusion. RESULTS: All groups behaved in a similar pattern. There was significant hypotension after graft reperfusion in GI and GII (M2 = 56.2 +/- 6.4 and M3 = 57.2 +/- 8.3 mm Hg and M2 = 65.7 +/- 10.2 and M3 = 67.8 +/- 16.8 mm Hg, respectively), accompanied by elevated HR. The ETco(2) was elevated at M2 (42 mm Hg) and M3 (40 mm Hg). Metabolic acidosis was observed after reperfusion, with significant increase in K levels. CONCLUSION: The anesthetic protocol for donors and recipients was safe to perform the procedure, allowing control of hemodynamic and metabolic changes after reperfusion without differences regarding immunosuppression.",M2
20162738,"Influence of heart rate on quality of life in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.BACKGROUND: Current criteria for rate control in atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment are empirical and based on a small amount of scientific data. HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to analyze the influence of heart rate (<e>HR</e>, measured by the 6-minute walk test [6MWT] and 24-hour Holter monitoring) on quality of life (QoL). METHODS: A total of 89 male patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and resting HR &lt; 90 bpm were included. QoL (assessed by the Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36] questionnaire) was compared among 3 groups of patients classified by HR testing results: group 1 had HR &lt; or = 110 bpm on 6MWT and &lt; or = 80 bpm on Holter monitor; group 2 had HR in the target area by 1 but not both tests; and group 3 had HR &gt; 110 bpm on 6MWT and &gt; 80 bpm on Holter monitor. RESULTS: There were significant differences among the 3 groups in physical and mental component summary scores (285.9 +/- 73.9; 276.6 +/- 80.8; 230.3 +/- 91.0, P = .035; and 319.8 +/- 70.2; 294.7 +/- 76.0; 255.0 +/- 107.1, P = .026, respectively).When the methods were analyzed separately, there was a significant difference on QoL in physical and mental summary scores in patients with maximal HR &lt; or = 110 bpm on 6MWT in comparison with HR &gt; 110 bpm (P = .04 and P = .01, respectively) and in the physical summary score in patients with average HR &lt; or = 80 bpm on Holter monitor in comparison with HR &gt; 80 bpm (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Holter monitoring and 6MWT should be performed as complementary methods to better predict QoL.",M2
20147604,"Response of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity to intravenous irbesartan in heart failure.To determine the effect of irbesartan treatment on resting levels and arterial baroreflex control of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA) in heart failure (HF), we studied conscious normal sheep and sheep with HF induced by rapid ventricular pacing for 8-10 wk (n = 7 per group). In HF, there is a large increase in CSNA that is detrimental to outcome. The causes of this increase in CSNA and the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on CSNA in HF are unclear. CSNA, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (<e>HR</e>), and arterial baroreflex curves were recorded during a resting period and after 90 min of irbesartan infusion (12 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) iv). This dose of irbesartan abolished the pressor response to intravenous ANG II infusion but caused only a slight decrease in the pressor response to centrally administered ANG II. In HF, there was a large increase in CSNA (from 44 +/- 3 to 87 +/- 3 bursts/100 heartbeats). Irbesartan reduced arterial pressure in the normal and HF groups, but the usual baroreflex-mediated increases in CSNA and HR were prevented. This resulted from a significant leftward shift in the CSNA and HR baroreflex curves in both groups. Irbesartan also decreased the sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex control of CSNA. Short-term treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, at a dose that abolished the response to circulating, but not central, ANG II, prevented the reflex increase in CSNA in response to the drug-induced fall in arterial pressure.",M2
20146781,"Influence of the maximum heart rate attained during exercise testing on subsequent heart rate recovery.BACKGROUND: Abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) following exercise testing has been shown to be a predictor for adverse cardiovascular events. The actual maximum heart rate (MHR) attained during the exercise test does not however have a distinct significance in traditional HRR assessment. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of MHR in HRR. METHODS: This prospective study consisted of 164 patients (62% male, mean age 53.7 + or - 11.7 years) who were referred for a symptom-limited standard Bruce Protocol treadmill exercise test, based on clinical indications. The patients were seated immediately at test completion and the heart rate (<e>HR</e>) recorded at one and two minutes postexercise. A normal HRR was defined as a HR drop of 18 beats per minute or more at the end of the first minute of recovery. The HRR profile of patients who reached &gt; or = 85% of their maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) during peak exercise were then compared to HRR profile of those who could not. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients (Group A) achieved a MHR &gt; or = 85% of MPHR during peak exercise whereas 52 patients (Group B) did not. Chi-square analysis showed a higher incidence of normal HRR in Group A compared to Group B (p = 0.029). Analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that group A had a greater HRR at the first minute F(1,162)= 6.98, p = &lt;0.01) but not the second minute (F(1,162)=1.83, p = .18) postexercise. CONCLUSION: There is a relation between the peak heart rate attained during exercise and the subsequent HRR. A low peak heart rate increases the likelihood of a less than normal HRR. Assessment of the entire heart-rate response seems warranted for more thorough risk-stratification.",M2
20142275,"The TRPv1 receptor is a mediator of the exercise pressor reflex in rats.The skeletal muscle exercise pressor reflex (EPR) induces increases in heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during physical activity. This reflex is activated during contraction by stimulation of afferent fibres responsive to mechanical distortion and/or the metabolic by-products of skeletal muscle work. The molecular mechanisms responsible for activating these afferent neurons have yet to be identified. It has been reported that activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPv1) receptor within skeletal muscle (localized to unmyelinated afferent fibres) elicits increases in MAP and HR similar to those generated by the EPR. Thus, we hypothesized that stimulation of the TRPv1 receptor during muscle contraction contributes to the activation of the EPR. The EPR was activated by electrically induced static muscle contraction of the hindlimb in decerebrate Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 61) before and after the administration of the TRPv1 receptor antagonists, capsazepine (Capz; 100 microg/100 microl), iodoresinaferatoxin (IRTX; 1 microg/100 microl), or Ruthenium Red (RR; 100 microg/100 microl). Static muscle contraction alone induced increases in both HR (8 +/- 2 bpm) and MAP (21 +/- 3 mmHg). The HR and MAP responses to contraction were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) after the administration of Capz (2 +/- 1 bpm; 7 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively), IRTX (3 +/- 2 bpm; 5 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively) and RR (0 +/- 1, bpm; 5 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively). These data suggest that the TRPv1 receptor contributes importantly to activation of the EPR during skeletal muscle contraction in the rat.",M2
20142272,"Autonomic control of heart rate by metabolically sensitive skeletal muscle afferents in humans.Isolated activation of metabolically sensitive skeletal muscle afferents (muscle metaboreflex) using post-exercise ischaemia (PEI) following handgrip partially maintains exercise-induced increases in arterial blood pressure (BP) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), while heart rate (<e>HR</e>) declines towards resting values. Although masking of metaboreflex-mediated increases in cardiac SNA by parasympathetic reactivation during PEI has been suggested, this has not been directly tested in humans. In nine male subjects (23 +/- 5 years) the muscle metaboreflex was activated by PEI following moderate (PEI-M) and high (PEI-H) intensity isometric handgrip performed at 25% and 40% maximum voluntary contraction, under control (no drug), parasympathetic blockade (glycopyrrolate) and beta-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol or propranalol) conditions, while beat-to-beat HR and BP were continuously measured. During control PEI-M, HR was slightly elevated from rest (+3 +/- 2 beats min(-1)); however, this HR elevation was abolished with beta-adrenergic blockade (P &lt; 0.05 vs. control) but augmented with parasympathetic blockade (+8 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P &lt; 0.05 vs. control and beta-adrenergic blockade). The HR elevation during control PEI-H (+9 +/- 3 beats min(-1)) was greater than with PEI-M (P &lt; 0.05), and was also attenuated with beta-adrenergic blockade (+4 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P &lt; 0.05 vs. control), but was unchanged with parasympathetic blockade (+9 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P &gt; 0.05 vs. control). BP was similarly increased from rest during PEI-M and further elevated during PEI-H (P &lt; 0.05) in all conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the muscle metaboreflex increases cardiac SNA during PEI in humans; however, it requires a robust muscle metaboreflex activation to offset the influence of cardiac parasympathetic reactivation on heart rate.",M2
20124208,"Enhanced QT shortening and persistent tachycardia after generalized seizures.OBJECTIVE: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are a major risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We investigated whether ictal/postictal cardiac features were dependent on seizure type within individual patients. METHODS: ECG data from patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing presurgical investigation who had both complex partial seizures and secondarily GTCS during video-EEG telemetry were retrospectively reviewed. Peri-ictal heart rate (<e>HR</e>), corrected QT interval (QTc), HR variability, and cardiac rhythm were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in this study. Secondarily GTCS led to higher ictal HR, persistent postictal tachycardia, and decreased postictal HR variability. Moreover, abnormal shortening of QTc occurred in 17 patients mainly during the early postictal phase and significantly more often in secondarily GTCS. Abnormal QTc prolongation occurred in 3 patients with no significant association with GTCS. Benign cardiac arrhythmias occurred in 14 patients and were independent of seizure type. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a substantial disturbance of autonomic function following secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The observed alterations could potentially facilitate sudden cardiac death and might contribute to the association of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy with GTCS.",M2
20120628,"Changes in cardiac variability after REM sleep deprivation in recurrent nightmares.STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess whether dysfunctional autonomic regulation during REM sleep as indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) is a pathophysiological factor in frequent nightmares (NMs). DESIGN: Monitoring with polysomnography (PSG) and electrocardiography (ECG) for 3 consecutive nights: Night 1 (N1), adaptation night; N2, administration of partial REM sleep deprivation; N3, recovery night. Differences between NM and control (CTL) groups assessed for ECG measures drawn from wakefulness, REM sleep, and Stage 2 sleep on both N1 and N3. SETTING: Hospital-based sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen subjects with frequent NMs (&gt; or = 1 NM/week; mean age = 26.1 +/- 8.7 years) but no other medical or psychiatric disorders and 11 healthy comparison subjects ( &lt; 1 NM/month; mean age = 27.1+/- 5.6 years). RESULTS: NM and CTL groups differed on 2 REM sleep measures only on N1; the NM group had longer REM latencies and REM/NREM cycle durations than did the CTL group. No differences were found on time domain and absolute frequency domain ECG measures for either N1 or N3. However, altered HRV for the NM group was suggested by significantly higher LFnu, lower HFnu, and higher LF/HF ratio than for the CTL group. CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with a higher than normal sympathetic drive among NM subjects which is unmasked by high REM sleep propensity. Results also support a growing literature linking anxiety disorders of several types (panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder) to altered <e>HR</e> variability.",M2
20112603,"The evaluation of cardiovascular response to exercise in healthy Turkish children.The purpose of our study was to determine the normal cardiovascular responses of healthy Turkish children to exercise and to determine the reference values. Two hundred and eighty-four healthy children (115 girls, 169 boys) aged 5-14 were enrolled in the study. Exercise time (ET), workload that can be tolerated with exercise (MET value), change in heart rate (A <e>HR</e>), peak systolic and peak diastolic blood pressures (SBPmax and DBPmax), change in systolic blood pressure (delta SBP), and peak rate-pressure product (RPPmax) were positively correlated with age. There was no correlation between peak heart rate (HRmax) and age and there was also no significant increase in change in diastolic blood pressure (delta DBP) with increasing age. The means +/- SD values for ET, workload, HRmax, delta HR, SBPmax, DBPmax, delta SBP, deltaDBP, and RPPmax were 13.18 +/- 1.4 min, 8.56 +/- 0.93 MET, 171.46 +/- 1.91/min, 67.22 +/- 6.65/min, 125.16 +/- 13.36 mmHg, 73.32 +/- 4.06 mmHg, 24.3 +/- 5.96 mmHg, 7.2 +/- 6.9 mmHg, and 21504.7 +/- 2176.4, respectively. The values found in our study may be accepted as reference values of healthy Turkish children for exercise testing. The formula modified as (200-age) x 0.85 is thought to be more suitable to predict the target heart rate in children.",M2
20112261,"A longitudinal study of emotion regulation and anxiety in middle childhood: Associations with frontal EEG asymmetry in early childhood.We investigated whether brain electrical activity during early childhood was associated with anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation during a stressful situation during middle childhood. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetries were measured during baseline and during a cognitive control task at 4 1/2 years. Anxiety and emotion regulation were assessed during a stressful situation at age 9 (speech task), along with measures of heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and heart rate variability (HRV). Questionnaires were also used to assess anxiety and emotion regulation at age 9. Results from this longitudinal study indicated that children who exhibited right frontal asymmetry in early childhood experienced more physiological arousal (increased HR, decreased HRV) during the speech task at age 9 and less ability to regulate their emotions as reported by their parents. Findings are discussed in light of the associations between temperament and development of anxiety disorders.",M2
20110009,"The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone and the risk of coronary heart disease: a retrospective cohort study using a US health insurance database.BACKGROUND: The thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone maleate and pioglitazone hydrochloride, are commonly prescribed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although recent meta-analyses suggest there is an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among rosiglitazone users, these findings were not supported by data from other studies. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research was to compare the risk of MI, coronary revascularization (CR), and sudden death in patients who began rosiglitazone therapy versus those who began pioglitazone therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using information from a large health care database (with data available on approximately 14 million individuals). All initiators of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone from July 1, 2000, through March 31, 2007, for whom the first dispensing followed &gt;or=6 months of health plan membership and the member's 18th birthday were identified. The propensity score method was used to create matched cohorts of patients in 3 treatment groups: TZD monotherapy, dual therapy (a TZD plus another antidiabetic agent), and TZD therapy with concomitant insulin. Follow-up continued to a change in treatment regimen, defined as regimen switch (ie, the addition of any antidiabetic agent to an existing regimen) or regimen stop (ie, the discontinuation of any component of the therapeutic regimen). Three outcomes that represent coronary heart disease were assessed for this analysis: MI, CR, and sudden death. The proportional hazards model, stratified by therapeutic regimen, was used to estimate hazard ratios (<e>HRs</e>) and 95% CIs of coronary heart disease risk associated with use of rosiglitazone relative to pioglitazone. RESULTS: Among 47,501 matched pairs of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone users, 72,104 (75.9%) were receiving TZD monotherapy, 17,822 (18.8%) were receiving dual therapy, and 5076 (5.3%) were receiving TZD therapy with insulin. Mean follow-up was 9.6 months with regimen switch as the censoring event and 8.4 months with regimen stop as the censoring event. For MI, the HR was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.12-1.62) through regimen switch and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.13-1.75) through regimen stop. For the composite outcome of MI, CR, and/or sudden death, the HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97-1.22) through regimen switch and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.98-1.27) through regimen stop. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort analysis, MI was more common in users of rosiglitazone than in users of pioglitazone. The incidence of a combined end point of MI, CR, and/or sudden death in patients receiving rosiglitazone was not significantly different from that in patients receiving pioglitazone.",M2
20109208,"Effect of exenatide on heart rate and blood pressure in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular effects of glucose-lowering agents are of increasing interest. Our aim was to assess the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and blood pressure (BP) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects with T2DM on metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione were randomized to receive exenatide (5 microg for 4 weeks followed by 10 microg) or placebo BID for 12 weeks. Heart rate and BP were assessed with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. The primary measure was change from baseline in mean 24-hour HR. RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (28 exenatide, 26 placebo) were randomized and comprised the intent-to-treat population. Baseline values (exenatide and placebo) were (mean +/- SE) 74.4 +/- 2.1 and 74.5 +/- 1.9 beats/minute for HR, 126.4 +/- 3.2 and 119.9 +/- 2.8 mm Hg for systolic BP (SBP), and 75.2 +/- 2.1 and 70.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for diastolic BP (DBP). At 12 weeks, no significant change from baseline in 24-hour HR was observed with exenatide or placebo (LS mean +/- SE, 2.1 +/- 1.4 versus -0.7 +/- 1.4 beats/minute, respectively; between treatments, p = 0.16). Exenatide therapy was associated with trends toward lower 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime SBP; changes in DBP were similar between groups. No changes in daytime or nighttime rate pressure product were observed. With exenatide, body weight decreased from baseline by -1.8 +/- 0.4 kg (p &lt; 0.0001; treatment difference -1.5 +/- 0.6 kg, p &lt; 0.05). The most frequently reported adverse event with exenatide was mild to moderate nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide demonstrated no clinically meaningful effects on HR over 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with T2DM. The observed trends toward lower SBP with exenatide warrant future investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00516074.",M2
20108844,"Effect of hyperbaric pressure during scuba diving on autonomic modulation of the cardiac response: application of the continuous wavelet transform to the analysis of heart rate variability.This study sought to determine the effects of hyperbaric pressure on heart rate modulation, by analyzing potential changes in heart rate variability (HRV). Ten divers were exposed to pressures of 1, 2, 3, and 4 atmospheres absolute (ATA). The test was performed in a hyperbaric chamber. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>) was recorded in supine subjects for 10 minutes per atmosphere. HRV was analyzed in the frequency mode (fast-Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform). Results confirmed bradycardia as pressure increased. The drop in HR attained statistical significance after 2, 3, and 4 ATA. Signal energy (normalized TP values) rose progressively, becoming significant at 2 ATA. High frequency and low frequency displayed similar behavior in both cases. Although frequency band peaks did not yield clear results, continuous wave transform analysis showed that the frequency spectrum tended to shift into the high-frequency range as pressure increased. In summary, increased pressure prompted increased bradycardia, and HRV shifted into high-frequency range.",M2
20105060,"Ambient air pollution alters heart rate regulation in aged mice.CONTEXT: Heart rate alterations associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants have been observed in epidemiological studies and animal experiments. Nevertheless, the time-lag of these associations is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: Determine the association at different time-lags between the complex mixture of ambient concentrations of PM, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and markers of cardiac function in a model of aged mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AKR/J inbred mice were exposed to ambient air, 6 h daily for 40 weekdays. During this period, the animals' electrocardiogram (ECG), deep body temperature (Tdb), and body weight (BW) were registered, and concentrations of PM, CO, NO(2), as well as air temperature and relative humidity (RH) were measured. Data analysis included random effects models with lagged covariate methods. RESULTS: CO was significantly associated with declines in heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and heart rate variability (HRV), PM was significantly associated with declines in HRV and BW, and NO(2) was significantly associated with declines in HR. Some significant associations occurred in the same day (PM and HRV, PM and BW, CO and HR), whereas others were delayed by 1 to 3 days (CO and HR, CO and HRV, NO(2) and HR, PM and HRV). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Finding significant declines in heart function in aged mice associated with the combined effects of air pollutants at ambient concentrations and at different time-lags is of great importance to public health. These results further implicate the potential short term and delayed effects of air pollution on HR alterations.",M2
20105054,"Effect of acute restraint stress on the tachycardiac and bradycardiac responses of the baroreflex in rats.In the present study, we evaluated cardiac baroreflex responses of rats submitted to acute restraint stress. The baroreflex was tested: immediately before, during a 30 min exposure to restraint stress, as well as 30 and 60 min after ending the stress session (recovery period). Restraint increased both mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>). The magnitude of tachycardiac responses evoked by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside was higher during restraint stress, whereas that of bradycardiac responses evoked by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was decreased. Restraint-evoked baroreflex changes were still observed at 30 min into the recovery period, although MAP and HR values had already returned to control values. The baroreflex was back to control values at 60 min of the recovery period. Intravenous administration of the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol blocked the restraint-evoked increase in the tachycardiac baroreflex response, but did not affect the effects on the bradycardiac response. In conclusion, the present results suggest that psychological stresses, such as those resulting from acute restraint, affect the baroreflex. Restraint facilitated the tachycardiac baroreflex response and reduced the bradycardiac response. Restraint-related effects on baroreflex persisted for at least 30 min after ending restraint, although MAP and HR had already returned to control levels. The cardiac baroreflex returned to control values 60 min after the end of restraint, indicating non-persistent effects of acute restraint on the baroreflex. Results also indicate that the influence of restraint stress on the baroreflex tachycardiac response is mainly dependent on cardiac sympathetic activity, whereas the action on the bradycardiac response is mediated by the cardiac parasympathetic component.",M2
20097360,"Prevalence of increased arterial stiffness in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus differs by measurement site and sex: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.OBJECTIVE: To discuss vascular stiffness commonly encountered in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). STUDY DESIGN: We examined 535 subjects with T1DM (14.6 years; 53% male, 88% non-Hispanic white) and 241 healthy control subjects (17.8 years; 42% male, 39% non-Hispanic white). Abnormalities in brachial distensibility (BrachD), pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index corrected to a <e>HR</e> of 75 (AIx-75) were examined. RESULTS: Subjects with T1DM had higher body mass index, LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, and blood pressure than control subjects. Diabetic subjects had lower BrachD and higher AIx-75 indicating increased stiffness. Age-adjusted pulse wave velocity-trunk (aorto-femoral) was higher in cases (all P &lt;or= &lt; .05). Increased peripheral stiffness was more common than central stiffness in subjects with T1DM (low BrachD in 33% vs high PWV-trunk in 9.9%). Male subjects with type 1 diabetes had a higher prevalence of VS abnormalities than females. Presence of T1DM, male sex, and increased mean arterial pressure were the most consistent independent determinants of vascular stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Increased vascular stiffness is present in youth with T1DM with peripheral abnormalities predominating especially in males. Traditional risk factors are important correlates. Identifying early vascular abnormalities in youth with T1DM will allow for implementation of more aggressive risk factor management.",M2
20096457,"Compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure in paraplegic rats: implication of central tachykinin NK-1 and NK-3 receptors?People with high level spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from both hypotension and spontaneous hypertension due to loss of supraspinal control of spinal sympathetic outflow. Few reports have addressed whether any changes occur in central regulation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rat (<e>HR</e>) at the supraspinal level. Central tachykinin NK-1 and NK-3 receptors are located in many cardiovascular areas in the brain and are known to modulate BP and HR. This study examined the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) effects of the selective NK-1 receptor agonist [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP (65pmol, n=6) and NK-3 receptor agonist senktide (650pmol, n=6) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR before and after complete spinal cord transection at thoracic level 4 (T4). [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP evoked increases in MAP and HR which were still present 4days after the T4 SCI. Further analysis using the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10mgkg(-1)) revealed an increased contribution of HR in the MAP increase after SCI. For senktide, 2 and 5weeks after T4 SCI, the rise in MAP induced by senktide was significantly increased in magnitude and was similar to a normal response at 8weeks. These effects were accompanied by a bradycardia, which was still present and amplified at 8weeks. Our results reveal a transient potentiation of the senktide-mediated MAP effect and a greater contribution of the HR in MAP increase by [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP in T4 transected rats. Although the significance of these changes remains to be established. This suggest a reorganization of supraspinal mechanisms regulating BP and HR after a high level SCI. Central NK-1 and NK-3 receptors might therefore contribute to the maintenance of MAP following high thoracic SCI.",M2
20095402,"[Studying intermediatory regulation of heart rhythm using Daphnia magna as the alternative test object]A functional test using Daphnia magna Straus hydrobionts is proposed for studying the role of intermediatory relationships in the heart rate (<e>HR</e>) regulation. It is established that the M-cholinomimetic carbamylcholine increases for two hours and decreases after 24 hours the HR in D. magna. Caffeine (a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors) potentiates the action of carbamylcholine during the first hour and then ceases to influence the drug effect. Caffeine normalizes the HR rate D magna, which was decreased by the cholinolytic atropine and the beta-adrenolytic atenolol. The possibilities of using the proposed test for the investigation of intermediatory relationships in the HR regulation, rapid analysis of the cardiothropic action of xenobiotics, and the primary screening of drugs for the pharmacological correction of HR disturbances are discussed.",M2
20095226,"Cardiorespiratory effects of enoximone in anaesthetised colic horses.REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: No studies have been reported on the effects of enoximone in anaesthetised colic horses. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether enoximone improves cardiovascular function and reduces dobutamine requirement in anaesthetised colic horses. METHODS: Forty-eight mature colic horses were enrolled in this prospective, randomised clinical trial. After sedation (xylazine 0.7 mg/kg bwt) and induction (midazolam 0.06 mg/kg bwt, ketamine 2.2 mg/kg bwt), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and a lidocaine constant rate infusion (15 mg/kg bwt, 2 mg/kg/h). Horses were ventilated (PaCO2 &lt; 8.00 kPa). If hypotension occurred, dobutamine and/or colloids were administered. Ten minutes after skin incision, horses randomly received an i.v. bolus of enoximone (0.5 mg/kg bwt) or saline. Monitoring included respiratory and arterial blood gases, heart rate (<e>HR</e>), arterial pressure and cardiac index (CI). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke index (SI) and oxygen delivery index (DO2I) were calculated. For each variable, changes between baseline and T10 within each treatment group and/or colic type (small intestines, large intestines or mixed) were analysed and compared between treatments in a fixed effects model. Differences between treatments until T30 were investigated using a mixed model (a = 0.05). RESULTS: Ten minutes after enoximone treatment, CI (P = 0.0010), HR (P = 0.0033) and DO2I (P = 0.0007) were higher and SVR lower (P = 0.0043) than at baseline. The changes in CI, HR and SVR were significantly different from those after saline treatment. During the first 30 min after enoximone treatment, DO2I (P = 0.0224) and HR (P = 0.0003) were higher than after saline administration. Because the difference in HR between treatments was much clearer in large intestine colic cases, an interaction was detected between treatment and colic type in both analyses (P = 0.0076 and 0.0038, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enoximone produced significant, but short lasting, cardiovascular effects in colic horses. Potential relevance: Enoximone's cardiovascular effects in colic horses were of shorter duration than in healthy ponies.",M2
20094880,"Inferior vena cava collapsibility to guide fluid removal in slow continuous ultrafiltration: a pilot study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether ultrasound determination of the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and its collapsibility index (IVCCI) could be used to optimize the fluid removal rate while avoiding hypotension during slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF). METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients [13 men and 11 women, mean age 72 +/- 5 years; New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III-IV] with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and diuretic resistance were admitted to our 16-bed medical ICU. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), respiratory rate (RR), blood samples for hematocrit, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and arterial BGA plus lactate were obtained at baseline and than every 2 h from the beginning of SCUF. IVCD, assessed by M-mode subcostal echocardiography during spontaneous breathing, was evaluated before SCUF, at 12 h, and just after the cessation of the procedure. The IVCCI was calculated as follows: [(IVCD(max) - IVCD(min))/IVCD(max)] x 100. RESULTS: Mean UF time was 20.3 +/- 4.6 h with a mean volume of 287.6 +/- 96.2 ml h(-1) and a total ultrafiltrate production of 5,780.8 +/- 1,994.6 ml. No significant difference in MAP, HR, RR, and IVCD before and after UF was found. IVCCI increased significantly after UF (P &lt; 0.001). Hypotension was observed only in those patients (2/24) who reached an IVCCI &gt;30%. In all the other patients, a significant increase in IVCCI was obtained without any hemodynamic instability. CONCLUSION: IVC ultrasound is a rapid, simple, and non-invasive means for bedside monitoring of intravascular volume during SCUF and may guide fluid removal velocity.",M2
20093957,"A comparison of physiologic and physical discomfort responses between exercise modalities.To determine differences in physiologic responses and perceived discomfort during maximal and submaximal exercise with 2 common exercise modalities, the elliptical cross-trainer (ECT) and the arc trainer (ARC) were used, which undergoes an excursion of motion using an arc pathway. Eighteen subjects (10 male and 8 female; age = 24.7 +/- 2.6 yr, height = 172.2 +/- 10.3 cm, mass = 69.8 +/- 14.9 kg, %fat = 22.5 +/- 8.1%; mean +/- SD) performed maximal exercise protocols on a treadmill (TML), the ECT, and ARC. Subjects also performed 3 10-minute submaximal exercise bouts on the ECT and ARC at 55%, 65%, and 75% of TML maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in which heart rate (<e>HR</e>), VO2, ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, and hip, knee, and low-back discomfort were monitored. All testing on the ECT and ARC were performed in a counterbalanced order. The VO2max was greater during TML exercise compared with ECT (p = 0.007) but similar to the ARC. Both ECT and ARC elicited lower maximal HR values compared with maximal TML exercise (p = 0.0001). No difference was observed between ECT and ARC for VO2 during the submaximal exercise bouts (p &gt; 0.05). However, HR was greater during submaximal ECT exercise (p &lt; 0.0001). Perception of discomfort was not different between ECT and ARC for knees (p &gt; 0.05) and lower back (p &gt; 0.05) but different for the hips (p = 0.02). Similar VO2max values were observed with ARC and TML modalities. Greater perceptions of discomfort were observed with ECT compared with ARC at similar submaximal exercise intensities, suggesting individuals with, or at risk for, lower-extremity joint pathology may benefit from exercise with modalities other than the ECT.",M2
20090128,"Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity.Sexuality is a major way of intimacy in human being and it is very important in gender relationship, contributing to over all health. However, since association between sexual activity and sudden death determined by forensic autopsies related to cardiac or cerebral causes has been reported, some people with heart disease often abstain from sexual activity that could affect the quality of life. It is therefore important to learn the physical demand of sexual activity and the risk it may trigger. For decades, the cardiologists have conducted observational studies and clinical trials on healthy volunteers or patients. The most common indices responding to cardiovascular risks of sexuality were variances of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>), monitored by ambulatory blood pressure and dynamic electrocardiogram recording. BP and HR increase during the coitus just briefly and quickly recover to baseline level. Peak coital BP occurred at onset of plateau phase and quickly decreased, instead of emerged at orgasm as most people supposed. The metabolic equivalent of energy expenditure during the orgasm was relatively modest when compared with other physical exertion such as cycling. Epidemiological studies have suggested that sexual activity has favorable effect on health in the long term. This review summarizes and discusses the advances in the researches dealing with cardiovascular effects of sexual activity to better inform the cardiac patients.",M2
20089373,"Resting heart rate does not predict growth in preterm infants.BACKGROUND: Previous reports indicate that preterm infants with higher baseline heart rate (<e>HR</e>) have greater weight gain than preterm infants with lower baseline HR. To verify this correlation and the potential utility of resting HR as a bench mark for risk of extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR), we studied preterm infants born between 32 and 36weeks gestation. Earlier gestation infants (27 to 31weeks) were included. METHODS: In retrospective chart review we collected heart rate (HR) and growth data on 156 infants between 27.0 and 34.0weeks gestation from birth to hospital discharge. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in weight gain from day 10 of life in infants with higher resting HR compared to infants with lower resting HR. However, upon controlling for birth weight and gestational age, there was no significant relationship between HR and weight gain for any gestational age group of premature infants. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous reports, there was no significant relationship between HR and growth at any gestational age after controlling for birth weight and gestational age. It is important to continue to search for a clinical marker of risk for poor growth in preterm infants and to give an opportunity for nutritional interventions which may support better growth and developmental outcomes.",M2
20086321,"The different effects of fluid with and without carbohydrate ingestion on subjective responses of untrained men during prolonged exercise in a hot environment.This study examined the effects of maintaining euhydration by ingesting fluids with or without carbohydrate on subjective responses of untrained men during prolonged exercise in a hot environment. Six healthy untrained subjects completed 90 min of cycling exercises at 55% maximal oxygen consumption (V(O2max)) in a hot environment (temperature: 28(o)C, humidity: 50%) under three different experimental conditions. During the first trial, subjects did not ingest fluids during exercise (dehydration (DH) trial). In the second and third trials, subjects received mineral water (MW) and hypotonic fluid containing carbohydrate (HF), respectively, in amounts equaling their weight loss in the DH trial. At the end of exercise, the overall rating of perceived exertion (RPE-O) was lower in the MW and HF trials than in the DH trial (14.3+/-1.0 and 13.7+/-0.6 vs 17.7+/-1.0, p&lt;0.05, respectively). RPE-cardiovascular and RPE-legs were lower at the end of exercise in the HF trial compared with the DH trial. V(O2), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), and rectal temperature increased during exercise in the three trials. At the end of exercise, the drift in V(O2) was lower in the MW and HF trials than in the DH trial (304+/-41 and 339+/-40 vs 458+/-33 mL, p&lt;0.05, respectively). HR at the end of exercise in the HF trial was lower than in the DH trial (158+/-5 vs 173+/-7 bpm, p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that maintaining euhydration during prolonged exercise in untrained men could attenuate RPE-O and that hypotonic electrolyte-carbohydrate solution could attenuate RPE-legs during exercise.",M2
20079388,"Stress hormones and immunological responses to a dual challenge in professional firefighters.The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in heart rate (<e>HR</e>), catecholamines (norepinephrine [NE] and epinephrine [EPI]), pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-2 [IL-2] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and lymphocytes (CD8+ and CD56+) in firefighters exposed to a decision-making challenge (firefighting strategies and tactics drill) while participating in moderate intensity exercise. Nine professional male firefighters participated in two counterbalanced exercise conditions on a cycle ergometer: (1) 37 min of cycle ergometry at 60% VO(2max) (exercise alone condition ; EAC) and (2) 37 min of cycle ergometry at 60% VO(2max) along with 20 min of a computerized firefighting strategy and tactics decision-making challenge (firefighting strategy condition; FSC). FSC elicited significantly greater HR, NE, EPI, and IL-2 when compared to EAC. These elevations may suggest that the addition of a mental challenge to physical stress can alter the hormonal and immunological responses during firefighting. In addition, this evidence provides insight into the possible mechanisms that explain the link between physical activity, psychological stress, and stress-related diseases.",M2
20075530,"Dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to anesthetic induction to attenuate hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing fast-track CABG.During induction of general anesthesia hypertension and tachycardia caused by tracheal intubation may lead to cardiac ischemia and arrhythmias. In this prospective, randomized study, dexmedetomidine has been used to attenuate the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation with low dose fentanyl and etomidate in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization receiving beta blocker treatment. Thirty patients undergoing myocardial revascularization received in a double blind manner, either a saline placebo or a dexmedetomidine infusion (1 microg/kg) before the anesthesia induction. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored at baseline, after placebo or dexmedetomidine infusion, after induction of general anesthesia, one, three and five minutes after endotracheal intubation. In the dexmedetomidine (DEX) group systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were lower at all times in comparison to baseline values; in the placebo (PLA) group SAP, DAP and MAP decreased after the induction of general anesthesia and five minutes after the intubation compared to baseline values. This decrease was not significantly different between the groups. After the induction of general anesthesia, the drop in HR was higher in DEX group compared to PLA group. One minute after endotracheal intubation, HR significantly increased in PLA group while, it decreased in the DEX group. The incidence of tachycardia, hypotension and bradycardia was not different between the groups. The incidence of hypertension requiring treatment was significantly greater in the PLA group. It is concluded that dexmedetomidine can safely be used to attenuate the hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization receiving beta blockers.",M2
20075261,"Operational point of neural cardiovascular regulation in humans up to 6 months in space.Entering weightlessness affects central circulation in humans by enhancing venous return and cardiac output. We tested whether the operational point of neural cardiovascular regulation in space sets accordingly to adopt a level close to that found in the ground-based horizontal position. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>), finger blood and brachial blood pressure (BP), and respiratory frequency were collected in 11 astronauts from nine space missions. Recordings were made in supine and standing positions at least 10 days before launch and during spaceflight (days 5-19, 45-67, 77-116, 146-180). Cross-correlation analyses of HR and systolic BP were used to measure three complementary aspects of cardiac baroreflex modulation: 1) baroreflex sensitivity, 2) number of effective baroreflex estimates, and 3) baroreflex time delay. A fixed breathing protocol was performed to measure respiratory sinus arrhythmia and low-frequency power of systolic BP variability. We found that HR and mean arterial pressure did not differ from preflight supine values for up to 6 mo in space. Respiration frequency tended to decrease during prolonged spaceflight. Concerning neural markers of cardiovascular regulation, we observed in-flight adaptations toward homeostatic conditions similar to those found in the ground-based supine position. Surprisingly, this was not the case for baroreflex time delay distribution, which had somewhat longer latencies in space. Except for this finding, our results confirm that the operational point of neural cardiovascular regulation in space sets to a level close to that of an Earth-based supine position. This adaptation level suggests that circulation is chronically relaxed for at least 6 mo in space.",M2
20072052,"Direct validity of the yo-yo intermittent recovery test in young team handball players.The aim of this study was to examine the possible association between Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 performance (distance covered, Yo-Yo IR1) and match activities (direct validity) in young male team handball players. Eighteen young male players (age 14.3 +/- 0.5 years, body mass 64 +/- 28.7 kg, height 174 +/- 6 cm, body fat 11.2 +/- 3.9%) took part in this study. Players' match activities were videotaped during an experimental tournament (6 games/player) and analyzed using a computerized system. Games and Yo-Yo IR1 heart rates (<e>HRs</e>) (short-range telemetry, HR) and blood lactate concentrations ([la]b) were assessed throughout and at selected times of the games, respectively. Peak Yo-Yo IR1 HR was assumed as representative of individual maximal HR (HRmax). Mean and peak game HRs were 174 +/- 3 and 198 +/- 2 b.min, which corresponded to 87 and 99% of HRmax, respectively. Yo-Yo IR1 performance (1,831 +/- 373 m) was significantly related (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01) to total game distance (1,921 +/- 325 m). Post-game (9.2 +/- 2.3 mmol.L) and Yo-Yo IR1 (8.8 +/- 1.6 mmol.L) [la]b were significantly related (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.05). These findings demonstrated the direct validity of Yo-Yo IR1. Consequently, Yo-Yo IR1 test may be considered as a team handball test relevant for the assessment of intermittent high-intensity endurance in young male team handball players.",M2
20070573,"Salivary alpha-amylase stress reactivity across different age groups.tract Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) increases rapidly in response to psychosocial stress in young adults, but no direct comparisons between different age groups across the life span have been made. Secretion of sAA and cortisol was assessed in children, young adults, and older adults after exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test. Additionally, cardiovascular activity was measured in both adult groups. Older adults showed attenuated sAA, heart rate (<e>HR</e>), and heart rate variability (HRV) responses. Furthermore, we found higher sAA but lower cortisol at baseline as well as lower sAA and cortisol responses in children. Age x sex interactions were observed only for cortisol with higher responses in older male participants. No associations between the parameters were found. These results implicate sAA as an alternative or additional sympathetic stress marker throughout the life span, with marked and rapid stress responsiveness in three relevant age groups.",M2
20067977,"Spouses' cardiovascular reactivity to their partners' suffering.A laboratory study of older adults with osteoarthritis and their spouses was conducted to examine the unique influence of exposure to suffering on caregivers' risk for impaired psychological and physical health. Spouses' blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) were monitored during 2 tasks designed to capture their partners' suffering. First, spouses watched their partners (and a stranger) carry heavy logs across an 8-ft space for 3 min, a task that elicited pain expression. Second, spouses spoke about their partners' suffering (and also about a typical meal with their partners). Results showed that spouses' BP and HR increased when watching and talking about their partners' suffering, and exposure to a partner's suffering was more physiologically stressful than to a stranger's suffering. These findings suggest that heightened physiological stress caused by exposure to a loved one's suffering may be one pathway to caregivers' increased risk for cardiovascular disease.",M2
20067400,"Attenuation of maternal psychophysiological stress responses and the maternal cortisol awakening response over the course of human pregnancy.The effects of maternal stress during pregnancy may depend, in part, on the timing in gestation of the occurrence of stress. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of stage of gestation on maternal psychophysiological responses to stress using a standardized laboratory paradigm and on the cortisol response to awakening (CAR). A longitudinal design was employed to quantify maternal psychophysiological stress reactivity [changes in heart rate (<e>HR</e>), blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and psychological distress in response to the trier social stress test (TSST)] and the CAR at approximately 17 and 31 weeks gestation in a sample of 148 women. To account for the possible effects of habituation when being exposed to the same stress protocol twice, a non-pregnant comparison group (CG, N = 36) also underwent these assessments at two time points, with a comparable time interval between the assessments. In both groups, the TSST elicited significant changes in maternal HR, mean arterial pressure, and psychological distress levels but not a significant increase in cortisol levels. Among the pregnant women (pregnant group(PG)), the stressor-induced increases in HR, blood pressure, and psychological distress were significantly lower at the second (31 weeks gestation) compared to the first (17 weeks gestation) assessment of pregnancy (all p &lt; 0.01). The maternal CAR was also significantly attenuated in later compared to earlier gestation (p = 0.003). In the CG, there were no significant differences in psychophysiological stress responses and in the CAR across the two assessments. Among pregnant women there is a progressive attenuation of psychophysiological stress responses with advancing gestation. This attenuation is unlikely to be attributable to habituation. Individual differences in the degree of attenuation of stress responses over gestation may represent a novel marker of stress susceptibility in human pregnancy.",M2
20066475,"Heart rate-corrected QT interval in resting ECG predicts the risk  for development of type-2 diabetes mellitus.Chronic and subclinical sympathetic over-activity may underlie development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Since longer heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) represents predominance of sympathetic activity within autonomic balance, we investigated influences of QTc on the incidence of DM in a follow-up study. The subjects were 12,530 men and 7,163 women aged 30-59 years and apparently healthy at baseline. QTc in resting ECG was obtained using Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and the linear regression technique (QTcLR). Incident DM was identified by 'fasting serum glucose &gt; or =7.00 mmol l(-1) (126 mg dl(-1))' or/and 'on medication for DM'. Using Cox proportional hazard models, hazard ratio (<e>HR</e>) for incident DM was estimated according to the quartiles (Q1-Q4) of QTcB, QTcF or QTcLR, and its linear trends across the quartiles were checked. Baseline age, BMI, smoking, drinking, exercise and education were computed as conventional confounders. During the follow-up of 93,337 person-years for men and 51,517 person-years for women, 637 men and 192 women developed DM. The multivariate-adjusted HRs(95% confidence interval) for Q4 of QTcB, QTcF and QTcLR against corresponding Q1 were 1.85(1.46, 2.34), 1.31(1.04, 1.65) and 1.58(1.26, 1.99), respectively, for men, and 2.03(1.31, 3.16), 1.34(0.91, 2.00) and 1.58(1.04, 2.38), respectively, for women. Both sexes showed increasing trends in the HRs across the quartiles of QTcB, QTcF and QTcLR. In conclusion, QTc in resting ECG moderately but proportionally predicts the risk for development of DM in middle-aged healthy men and women. Moreover, the adverse effects of prolonged QTc are independent of those of conventional risk factors.",M2
20064745,"The effect of long term ventilatory support on hemodynamics in children with spinal muscle atrophy (SMA) type II.BACKGROUND: Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (Bi-PAP) treatment improves breathing efficiency and ventilation in children with SMA type II, but the effects of positive airway pressure swings on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and blood pressure are not known. Here we studied children with SMA to determine whether Bi-PAP administered during sleep is associated with changes in hemodynamics. METHODS: Ten children aged 8-12 years on long term Bi-PAP therapy were evaluated during a routine overnight sleep study. We recorded HR, ECG, thoraco-abdominal movements and blood gases. Blood pressure was estimated indirectly from pulse transit time (PTT) and the efficiency ( work ) of breathing from the phase angle between chest and abdominal movements. We compared periods of unsupported (spontaneous) and supported (i.e., on Bi-PAP) breathing during a split-night study. We also compared periods when Bi-PAP was judged optimal with periods that were sub-optimal due to mask leakage. RESULTS: HR and PTT during unsupported breathing and on optimal Bi-PAP were comparable (p=0.85 and 0.79, respectively), as were blood gases (SaO2, TcO2, TcCO2p=0.79, 0.88, 0.79, respectively). Breathing efficiency improved as expected when Bi-PAP was optimal (decrease in phase angle from 42 degrees to 22 degrees ). Sub-optimal Bi-PAP due to air leaking from the mask was associated with marked increases in breath-to-breath variability of HR, PTT and phase angle. CONCLUSIONS: Bi-PAP therapy does not appear to adversely influence hemodynamics in children with SMA if pressures are optimized and the mask is correctly applied and sealed.",M2
20061355,"Sympathetic and haemodynamic responses to lipids in healthy human ageing.Plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase vascular resistance and blood pressure (BP); however, the response with ageing is not known. The objectives of this study were to characterize the cardiovascular, neural and endocrine responses to acute elevation of NEFA concentration. Seventeen healthy older volunteers (7 male and 10 female; age, 69 +/- 1 years; body mass index, 24 +/- 0 kg m(2); values are means +/- s.e.m.) received a 4 h intravenous infusion of the lipid emulsion Intralipid 20% or placebo (single-blind, randomized, balanced order) on two different days separated by at least 2 weeks. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), BP, cardiac output, leptin, insulin, aldosterone, angiotensin II and F(2)-isoprostanes were measured. The change in HR (+8.8 +/- 0.9 versus +3.0 +/- 0.9 beats min(1)), systolic BP (+13.9 +/- 2.2 versus +6.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg) and diastolic BP (+7.4 +/- 1.5 versus +1.3 +/- 0.8 mmHg) was significantly greater after Intralipid versus placebo infusions (P &lt; 0.001). Lipid infusion increased MSNA burst frequency (+6.7 +/- 1.6 bursts min(1)), total MSNA (+45%; P &lt; 0.001) and concentrations of insulin (+40%), aldosterone (+50%) and F(2)-isoprostanes (+80%), but not leptin. Hyperlipidaemia caused directionally opposite responses for insulin (increased) and calf vascular resistance (decreased) in men, whereas insulin and calf vascular resistance responses were severely blunted and non-existent, respectively, in women. We conclude that direct vascular mechanisms and central sympathetic activation contribute to the NEFA pressor response; though absolute values are higher, the change is not different compared with previous studies in a younger population.",M2
20059761,"Varying postprandial abdominovagal and cardiovagal activity in normal subjects.BACKGROUND: Several studies have supported the hypothesis of different presentations in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) between cardiac and gastric vagal activity. Due to the regionality of the ANS, different responses among different organ systems to the same stimulation (such as a meal) are quite possible. METHODS: In this study we monitored the postprandial changes of heart rate variability (HRV) and gastrointestinal (GI) hormones to determine whether both responded in a similar pattern. Twenty-two healthy volunteers (6 males and 16 females) were enrolled. After recording a baseline ECG rhythm, further recordings were made at 20 min intervals for 120 min after a test meal. Serum human pancreatic polypeptide (PP), leptin, and total and active ghrelin levels were measured. KEY RESULTS: After the meal, <e>HR</e> increased significantly from baseline at each time point, except for 20 min after the meal. The high frequency (HF) power decreased significantly from 40 min to 120 min after the meal. In addition, the low frequency (LF) power also decreased significantly from 60 min to 120 min. However, the LF:HF ratio increased significantly from 20 min to 120 min. There was a marked increase (&gt;2 fold) of PP at 20 min after the meal, and the increase was sustained throughout the test period. CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: These findings suggest that HRV reflects cardiac, but not equivalently, abdominovagal activity. Therefore, HRV as an abdominovagal activity measurement in patients with GI functional problems should be used with caution, and other markers such as PP should be included.",M2
20058093,"Dose reduction in spiral CT coronary angiography with dual source  equipment. Part II. Dose surplus due to slope-up and slope-down of  prospective tube current modulation in a phantom model.PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to estimate surplus radiation dose in retrospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-gated dual-source computed tomography coronary angiography (DSCT-CA) due to the slope-up and slope-down of the tube current using prospectively ECG-triggered tube modulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an anthropomorphic phantom with an ECG-gated retrospective protocol and a DSCT scanner (Definition, Siemens). We used four tube current modulation algorithms: narrow pulsing window, with tube current reduction to 20% (A) and 4% (B) of peak current; and wide pulsing window, with tube current reduction to 20% (C) and 4% (D). Each algorithm was applied at five heart rates (<e>HR</e>=45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 bpm) with adaptive pitch values (0.2-0.5). Data sets were reconstructed in 5% increments from 0-95% of the R-R interval. Noise was measured at each R-R step in order to identify low noise (100% dose), medium noise (slope-up/down) and high noise (4/20% dose). Width of the transition window (slope-up/slope-down from 4/20% to 100% dose) was calculated. The surplus dose due to slope-up/slope-down was calculated. RESULTS: Surplus dose was 19% (A), 34% (B), 14% (C) and 21% (D). The transition window lasted 10%+10% (slope-up + down) for HR &lt;75 bpm and all HR in C (except for 120 bpm; 25%+15%), 15%+15% for HR &gt;90 bpm (A). For C and D, instead, the slope-up increased with progressively higher HR (10%-25% of the R-R interval, except for 90 bpm, 10%), whereas the slope-down remained constant at 5% (except for 120 bpm; 10%). CONCLUSIONS: The adaptive ECG-pulsing windows produced an increment of the surplus dose with increasing HR. The transition window was a constant source of surplus radiation dose in the range of 14%-34%.",M2
20056565,"Association of heart rate variability in taxi drivers with marked changes in particulate air pollution in Beijing in 2008.BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic function, has been -associated with particulate matter (PM) air pollution, especially in older patients and those with cardio-vascular diseases. However, the effect of PM exposure on cardiac autonomic function in young, healthy adults has received less attention. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between exposure to traffic-related PM with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;or= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and HRV in a highly exposed panel of taxi drivers. METHODS: Continuous measurements of personal exposure to PM2.5 and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring were conducted on 11 young healthy taxi drivers for a 12-<e>hr</e> work shift during their work time (09002100 hr) before, during, and after the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate associations between PM2.5 exposure and percent changes in 5-min HRV indices after combining data from the three time periods and controlling for potentially confounding variables. RESULTS: Personal exposures of taxi drivers to PM2.5 changed markedly across the three time -periods. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) intervals decreased by 2.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8% to 0.6%] with an interquartile range (IQR; 69.5 microg/m3) increase in the 30-min PM2.5 moving average, whereas the low-frequency and high-frequency powers decreased by 4.2% (95% CI, 9.0% to 0.8%) and 6.2% (95% CI, 10.7% to 1.5%), respectively, in association with an IQR increase in the 2-hr PM2.5 moving average. CONCLUSIONS: Marked changes in traffic-related PM2.5 exposure were associated with altered cardiac autonomic function in young healthy adults.",M2
20052497,"The effect of landiolol on cerebral blood flow in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.PURPOSE: To examine the effect of landiolol on cerebral blood flow in patients with normal or deteriorated cardiac function. METHODS: Thirty adult patients who were diagnosed with angina pectoris and who underwent elective off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were studied. Patients were divided into two groups, one with a preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or higher (normal EF group; n = 15) and the other with an EF of less than 50% (low EF group; n = 15). The mean cerebral blood flow velocity (Vmca) and pulsatility index (PI) in the middle cerebral artery were recorded using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Individual hemodynamic data were obtained using a pulmonary arterial catheter. RESULTS: In both groups, landiolol produced a significant decrease in heart rate (<e>HR</e>), which then returned to baseline 15 min after administration was completed. A significant decrease in mean arterial pressure occurred in the low EF group, but the decrease was within 30% of the baseline. In the normal EF group, there was no decrease in cardiac index (CI), whereas in the low EF group, CI significantly decreased along with the decrease in HR. There were no significant differences in Vmca and PI between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Continuous administration of landiolol at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/min after 1 min rapid i.v. administration at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg/min decreases HR without causing aggravation of CBF during treatment of intraoperative tachycardia in patients with normal and deteriorated cardiac function.",M2
20051497,"Increased vasopressin transmission from the paraventricular nucleus to the rostral medulla augments cardiorespiratory outflow in chronic intermittent hypoxia-conditioned rats.A co-morbidity of sleep apnoea is hypertension associated with elevated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) which may result from conditioning to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Our hypothesis is that SNA depends on input to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) from neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) that release arginine vasopressin (AVP) and specifically, that increased SNA evoked by CIH depends on this excitatory input. In two sets of neuroanatomical experiments, we determined if AVP neurons project from the PVN to the RVLM and if arginine vasopressin (V(1A)) receptor expression increases in the RVLM after CIH conditioning (8 h per day for 10 days). In the first set, cholera toxin beta subunit (CT-beta) was microinjected into the RVLM to retrogradely label the PVN neurons. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that 14.6% of CT-beta-labelled PVN neurons were double-labelled with AVP. In the second set, sections of the medulla were immunolabelled for V(1A) receptors, and the V(1A) receptor-expressing cell count was significantly greater in the RVLM (P &lt; 0.01) and in the neighbouring rostral ventral respiratory column (rVRC) from CIH- than from room air (RA)-conditioned rats. In a series of physiological experiments, we determined if blocking V(1A) receptors in the medulla would normalize blood pressure in CIH-conditioned animals and attenuate its response to disinhibition of PVN. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (<e>HR</e>), diaphragm (D(EMG)) and genioglossus muscle (GG(EMG)) activity were recorded in anaesthetized, ventilated and vagotomized rats. The PVN was disinhibited by microinjecting a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (BIC, 0.1 nmol), before and after blocking V(1A) receptors within the RVLM and rVRC with SR49059 (0.2 nmol). In RA-conditioned rats, disinhibition of the PVN increased BP, HR, minute D(EMG) and GG(EMG) activity and these increases were attenuated after blocking V(1A) receptors. In CIH-conditioned rats, a significantly greater dose of blocker (0.4 nmol) was required to blunt these physiological responses (P &lt; 0.05). Further, this dose normalized the baseline BP. In summary, AVP released by a subset of PVN neurons modulates cardiorespiratory output via V(1A) receptors in the RVLM and rVRC, and increased SNA in CIH-conditioned animals depends on up-regulation of V(1A) receptors in the RVLM.",M2
20048770,"ERPs and the evoked cardiac response to auditory stimuli: Intensity and cognitive load effects.The evoked cardiac response (ECR) may be described as the sum of two independent response components: an initial <e>HR</e> deceleration (ECR1) and a slightly later acceleration (ECR2) hypothesized to reflect stimulus registration and cognitive processing load, respectively. This study investigated processing load effects in the ECR and the event-related potential (ERP). Stimulus intensity was varied within subjects, and cognitive load was varied between subjects, in a counting/no counting task with a long interstimulus interval. The ECR showed a significant effect of counting, but not intensity. ERPs showed the expected obligatory processing effects in the N1, and substantial effects of cognitive load in the Late Positive Complex. Both ERP components varied with intensity. These novel data offer support for ANS-CNS similarities in reflecting some aspects of stimulus processing, but further work is needed to understand the possible contribution of ERP subcomponents to these effects.",M2
20048530,"Individualized 12-week exercise training programs enhance aerobic capacity of cancer survivors.Changes in aerobic capacity were evaluated after 12 weeks of training among a motivated heterogeneous group of cancer survivors (N = 54 [41 women and 13 men]), living at moderate altitude. Changes in power at lactate threshold (PT(lact)), peak power (P(peak)), and peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak) were evaluated in this group (average age, 53.8 + or - 10.8 years) that completed a minimum of 12 weeks of an individualized exercise program (on average 5 days x week(-1) for 47.5 + or - 17.2 min x session(-1)). Daily exercise duration was based on the goals and functional capacity of each individual. Training intensity for each subject was based on heart rate (<e>HR</e>) value at lactate threshold (T(lact)) obtained during a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test. Intensity was categorized into 5 ranges: recovery (60%-80% HR T(lact)); endurance (80%-100% HR T(lact)); threshold (100%-105% HR T(lact)); intervals (105%-115% HR T(lact)); and maximal efforts (&gt; or = 115% HR T(lact)). Overall compliance with the exercise prescription was approximately 72% and subjects reported exercising within the 5 training ranges, 12.1%, 63.9%, 18.6%, 4.2%, and 1.2% of the time, respectively. After training, PT(lact) increased 9.5% (121.8 + or - 43.5 vs 133.2 + or - 34.1 W; P &lt; 0.05), P(peak) increased 12.6% (175.5 + or - 55.6 vs 195.6 + or - 54.2 W; P &lt; 0.05) and VO(2) peak increased 11.4% (33.4 + or - 12.5 vs 37.2 + or - 10.4 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); P &lt; 0.05). The results of this research indicate that: 1) cardiopulmonary exercise testing with lactate threshold determination was safe and effective in the evaluation and exercise prescription phase for a group of cancer survivors and 2) a training program based on 2 higher intensity workouts per week can elicit significant changes in aerobic capacity of a diverse group of cancer survivors.",M2
20046518,"Effect of sildenafil on neuropathic pain and hemodynamics in rats.PURPOSE: The inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 produces an antinociception through the increase of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and increasing cGMP levels enhance the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, this phosphodiesterase 5 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the vasodilatation associated to cGMP. In this work, we examined the contribution of GABA receptors to the effect of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, in a neuropathic pain rat, and assessed the hemodynamic effect of sildenafil in normal rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuropathic pain was induced by ligation of L5/6 spinal nerves in Sprague-Dawley male rats. After observing the effect of intravenous sildenafil on neuropathic pain, GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline) and GABAB receptor antagonist (saclofen) were administered prior to delivery of sildenafil to determine the role of GABA receptors in the activity of sildenafil. For hemodynamic measurements, catheters were inserted into the tail artery. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) were measured over 60 min following administration of sildenafil. RESULTS: Intravenous sildenafil dose-dependently increased the withdrawal threshold to the von Frey filament application in the ligated paw. Intravenous bicuculline and saclofen reversed the antinociception of sildenafil. Intravenous sildenafil increased the magnitude of MAP reduction at the maximal dosage, but it did not affect HR response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sildenafil is active in causing neuropathic pain. Both GABAA and GABAB receptors are involved in the antinociceptive effect of sildenafil. Additionally, intravenous sildenafil reduces MAP without affecting HR.",M2
20042688,"Brain vasopressin V(1) receptors contribute to enhanced cardiovascular responses to acute stress in chronically stressed rats and rats with myocardial infarcton.The present study was designed to determine the role of central vasopressin 1 receptors (V(1)R) in the regulation of cardiovascular parameters in chronically stressed infarcted rats and sham-operated rats under resting conditions and during exposure to acute alarming stress. The experiments were performed on four groups of conscious sham-operated and four groups of infarcted rats subjected to intraventricular infusion of either vehicle or a V(1)R antagonist (V(1)RANT). Two groups of infarcted and two groups of sham-operated rats were subjected to mild chronic stressing. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) were determined under resting conditions and after exposure to acute stress (air jet). During vehicle infusion, MABP and HR increases in response to acute stress in the infarcted rats not subjected to chronic stress, and in the infarcted and sham-operated chronically stressed rats, were significantly greater than in the sham-operated rats not exposed to chronic stress. However, MABP and HR responses to acute stress in the chronically stressed infarcted rats and chronically stressed sham-operated rats did not differ. V(1)RANT abolished differences in cardiovascular responses to acute stress between the experimental groups. Resting cardiovascular parameters were not affected by any of the experimental treatments. It is concluded that chronic stressing enhances the pressor and tachycardic responses to acute stress in the sham-operated rats but does not further intensify these responses in infarcted rats.The results provide evidence that central V(1)Rs are involved in potentiation of cardiovascular responses to acute stress in chronically stressed rats, infarcted rats, and chronically stressed infarcted rats.",M2
20033490,"Assessment of image quality and radiation dose in prospective ECG-triggered coronary CT angiography compared with retrospective ECG-gated coronary CT angiography.We sought to determine the cut-off point of the average heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and HR differences in obtaining diagnostic image quality using prospective electrocardiographically-triggered (PT) coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and to compare image quality and radiation dose for CCTA obtained with PT CCTA and retrospective electrocardiographically-gated (RG) CCTA. A total of 178 patients who were referred for CCTA were enrolled in the study. Two independent radiologists evaluated subjective image quality. The non-diagnostic coronary segments were 32 of 1,226 segments (2.6%) for PT CCTA and 12 of 1,346 segments (0.9%) for RG CCTA (P &lt; 0.001). The mean image quality scores for PT CCTA and RG CCTA were 3.82 +/- 0.29 and 3.93 +/- 0.14, respectively. The mean radiation dose of patients that underwent PT CCTA was 3.83 +/- 0.84 mSv and RG CCTA 10.7 +/- 2.70 mSv. For patients who underwent PT CCTA, image quality was inversely related to HR (56.5 +/- 4.3 bpm; r = 0.38; P &lt; 0.001) and HR differences (2.8 +/- 2.7 bpm; r = 0.49; P &lt; 0.001). With the use of receiver operator characteristic analysis, a cut-off HR of 57 bpm (58% sensitivity, 67% specificity) and HR difference of 6 bpm (93% sensitivity, 46% specificity) were the best threshold for the prediction of diagnostic image quality. In patients with a regular, low HR, PT CCTA offers diagnostic image quality and substantially reduces effective radiation compared with the use of RG CCTA with dose modulation.",M2
20033206,"Influence of training status and exercise modality on pulmonary O(2) uptake kinetics in pre-pubertal girls.The limited available evidence suggests that endurance training does not influence the pulmonary oxygen uptake (V(O)(2)) kinetics of pre-pubertal children. We hypothesised that, in young trained swimmers, training status-related adaptations in the V(O)(2) and heart rate (<e>HR</e>) kinetics would be more evident during upper body (arm cranking) than during leg cycling exercise. Eight swim-trained (T; 11.4 +/- 0.7 years) and eight untrained (UT; 11.5 +/- 0.6 years) girls completed repeated bouts of constant work rate cycling and upper body exercise at 40% of the difference between the gas exchange threshold and peak V(O)(2). The phase II V(O)(2) time constant was significantly shorter in the trained girls during upper body exercise (T: 25 +/- 3 vs. UT: 37 +/- 6 s; P &lt; 0.01), but no training status effect was evident in the cycle response (T: 25 +/- 5 vs. UT: 25 +/- 7 s). The V(O)(2) slow component amplitude was not affected by training status or exercise modality. The time constant of the HR response was significantly faster in trained girls during both cycle (T: 31 +/- 11 vs. UT: 47 +/- 9 s; P &lt; 0.01) and upper body (T: 33 +/- 8 vs. UT: 43 +/- 4 s; P &lt; 0.01) exercise. The time constants of the phase II V(O)(2)and HR response were not correlated regardless of training status or exercise modality. This study demonstrates for the first time that swim-training status influences upper body V(O)(2) kinetics in pre-pubertal children, but that cycle ergometry responses are insensitive to such differences.",M2
20038750,"Resting heart rate pattern during follow-up and mortality in hypertensive patients.There is a linear relationship between resting heart rate (<e>HR</e>) and mortality in normotensive and untreated hypertensive individuals. However, it is not clear whether HR is a marker of increased risk in hypertensive patients on treatment. We investigated the relationship between HR and mortality in patients with hypertension. We analyzed baseline HR, final HR, and HR change during follow-up in patients attending the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic. Using a threshold of 80 bpm, we classified patients into those who had a consistently high (high-high) or low (low-low) HR or patients whose HR increased (low-high) or decreased (high-low) over time. Survival analysis was carried out using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, rate-limiting therapy, systolic blood pressure, and serum cholesterol. For each beat of HR change there was a 1% change in mortality risk. The highest risk of an all-cause event was associated with patients who had increased their HR by &gt;or=5 bpm at the end of follow-up (1.51 [95% CI: 1.03 to 2.20]; P=0.035). Compared with low-low patients, high-high patients had a 78% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.78 [95% CI: 1.31 to 2.41]; P&lt;0.001). Cardiovascular mortality showed a similar pattern of results. Rate-limiting therapy did not have an independent effect on outcomes in this analysis. Change in HR achieved during follow-up of hypertensive patients is a better predictor of risk than baseline or final HR. After correction for rate-limiting therapy, HR remained a significant independent risk factor.",M2
20030756,"Is freezing an adaptive reaction to threat? Evidence from heart rate reactivity to emotional pictures in victims of war and torture.The influence of past traumatic experiences on the defense cascade in response to affective pictures was examined in survivors of war and torture. Trauma-exposed refugees with and without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as well as healthy individuals viewed 75 pictures that varied in emotional content. Heart rate (<e>HR</e>) was recorded during the flickering stimulation of affective pictures in the context of a steady-state experiment. Whereas healthy controls showed the typical orienting response to aversive stimuli, PTSD patients reacted with an almost immediate increase in HR toward unpleasant pictures. Trauma-exposed participants without PTSD showed an indiscriminate orienting response regardless of picture category. The present findings argue for a faster flight/fight response to threatening cues in PTSD. In contrast, trauma-exposed controls seem to exhibit a state of permanent alertness toward a wide range of stimuli.",M2
20033207,"Monitoring endurance running performance using cardiac parasympathetic function.The aims of the present study were to (1) assess relationships between running performance and parasympathetic function both at rest and following exercise, and (2) examine changes in heart rate (<e>HR</e>)-derived indices throughout an 8-week period training program in runners. In 14 moderately trained runners (36 +/- 7 years), resting vagal-related HR variability (HRV) indices were measured daily, while exercise HR and post-exercise HR recovery (HRR) and HRV indices were measured fortnightly. Maximal aerobic speed (MAS) and 10 km running performance were assessed before and after the training intervention. Correlations (r &gt; 0.60, P &lt; 0.01) were observed between changes in vagal-related indices and changes in MAS and 10 km running time. Exercise HR decreased progressively during the training period (P &lt; 0.01). In the 11 subjects who lowered their 10 km running time &gt;0.5% (responders), resting vagal-related indices showed a progressively increasing trend (time effect P = 0.03) and qualitative indications of possibly and likely higher values during week 7 [+7% (90% CI -3.7;17.0)] and week 9 [+10% (90% CI -1.5;23)] compared with pre-training values, respectively. Post-exercise HRV showed similar changes, despite less pronounced between-group differences. HRR showed a relatively early possible decrease at week 3 [-20% (90% CI -42;10)], with only slight reductions near the end of the program. The results illustrate the potential of resting, exercise and post-exercise HR measurements for both assessing and predicting the impact of aerobic training on endurance running performance.",M2
