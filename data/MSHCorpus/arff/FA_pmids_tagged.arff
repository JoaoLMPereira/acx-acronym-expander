20308400,"Characterization of folate-dependent enzymes and indices of folate status in laying hens supplemented with folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.The conversion of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) to the biologically active 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is necessary for the deposition of folate in the egg. A study was conducted to compare egg folate concentrations, indices of folate status, and activities of folate-dependent enzymes in response to equimolar intake of either FA or 5-MTHF in laying hens. Forty-eight laying hens, 24 wk of age, from 2 different strains (Shaver White and Shaver Brown) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 (n = 8 per strain) dietary treatments: 1) basal diet with no supplemental folate, 2) basal diet + 10 mg/kg of FA, or 3) basal diet + 11.3 mg/kg of 5-MTHF for 3 wk. A completely randomized design with 3 dietary treatments and 2 laying hen strains in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement was used. Data were subjected to ANOVA, using the PROC GLM procedure of SAS. Plasma homocysteine, serum, and egg folate concentrations; hepatic serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and methionine synthase activity were affected by dietary folate supplementation but not by its form (FA and 5-MTHF). Relative to control hens, plasma homocysteine was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) by 14.2%, whereas serum and egg folate were increased (P &lt; 0.05) by 78.3 and 61.8%, respectively, in hens consuming either folate compound. Hepatic serine hydroxymethyltransferase and methionine synthase activity were increased and decreased (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, in folate-fed birds compared with control-fed birds. Hepatic dihydrofolate reductase was influenced by both the addition and form of dietary folate, being higher (P &lt; 0.05) in FA-fed birds than in 5-MTHF and control-fed birds. Feed efficiency was improved (P &lt; 0.05) in 5-MTHF-fed birds relative to FA-fed birds. Strain of hen influenced serum folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations but not other indices of folate metabolism. Overall, FA and 5-MTHF have equivalent effects in enhancing egg folate concentrations and improving folate status in laying hens. Also, supplementation and form of folate may modulate the activity of folate-dependent enzymes.",M1
20206253,"Vigabatrin (VGB) administered during late gestation lowers maternal folate concentration and causes pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction and skeletal hypoplasia in the mouse.Vigabatrin (VGB) has several therapeutic advantages over older antiepileptic drugs (AED), but there is a lack of information about its potential reproductive toxicologic effects. Our aim was to evaluate the consequences of VGB administered during late gestation on fetal growth and development in the mouse. Based on the results of our previous study, we administered groups of mice a single dose of 450 mg/kg VGB on one of gestation days (GD) 15, 16 or 17. Fetuses were collected on GD 18. VGB groups had a significant incidence of fetal death, abortion, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and hypoplasia of the axial skeleton, metacarpals, metatarsal and phalanges. Abortion was characterized by visible hemorrhagic expulsion of the embryos with their membranes. Maternal plasma folate (<e>FA</e>) and vitamin B12 concentrations were found to be markedly reduced within 12h of VGB treatment. Mice were supplemented with FA from GD 12 through GD 17 with or without a single dose of VGB on GD 15. This group had no abortions. Their fetuses had better body weight and lower frequency of IUGR than those of the non-supplemented VGB group. These data suggest that reductions in maternal FA and vitamin B12 concentrations play an important role in fetal loss, IUGR and skeletal hypoplasia induced by VGB during late gestation in the mouse. In view of the finding that a significant maternal toxicity is associated with this dose regimen, additional groups of mice were treated with 350 mg/kg VGB during embryogenesis and late gestation. This treatment was found to be maternally nontoxic. However, this low dose also resulted in significant fetal loss and IUGR when treatment occurred during late gestation. These data support the hypothesis that late gestation is particularly susceptible to VGB-induced fetal loss and IUGR in the mouse.",M1
20175948,"Folic acid supplementation in pregnant women.INTRODUCTION: Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) deficiency is associated with neural tube defects (NTD). In a non-risk pregnancy, The Danish National Board of Health recommends FA supplementation from planned pregnancy until three months after conception. We explored pregnant women's knowledge about and actual supplementation with FA and related this to education, number of pregnancies and age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-four consecutive pregnant women with a midwife consultation were included in the period 25-28 August 2008. All filled in a unified questionnaire. RESULTS: 82% had knowledge of FA supplementation and 89% received FA supplementation. 51% followed national recommendations. We found a statistically significant correlation between higher educational level and knowledge about FA supplementation, actual supplementation of FA and FA supplementation in accordance with national recommendations. No statistical associations were found between number of pregnancies or age and any FA-related parameters. Family, friends, general practitioner (GP) and the internet were the main information sources. CONCLUSION: Correct FA supplementation is quite low; conversely, knowledge about and actual FA supplementation are fairly high. Further intervention is necessary to increase the level of correct FA supplementation. Women with a low educational level--which may herald low socio-economic status--seem to form a suitable target group for information campaigns. Multiple pregnancies or higher age should not be perceived as indicators of a higher information level. Dissemination of information to the pregnant women including family, friends, GPs or the internet is recommended.",M1
20134159,"Moderate or supranormal folic acid supplementation does not exert a protective effect for homocysteinemia and methylation markers in growing rats.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) deficiency/supplementation effects seem to be dependent on age group and/or physiological status. The aim was to evaluate changes associated with rapid growth in relation to methionine metabolism in rats. METHODS: Four groups (n = 10 each) of male Sprague Dawley rats (5 weeks old) were on diets that varied in their FA content: 0 mg FA/kg diet (deficient), 2 mg FA/kg diet (control), 8 mg FA/kg diet (moderate supplementation), 40 mg FA/kg diet (supranormal supplementation). Animals were fed ad libitum for 30 days. Biomarkers of methionine metabolism and antioxidant status were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum total homocysteine concentration increased (p &lt; 0.01) in FA deficient animals, with no differences between the supplemented groups. The hepatic 'methylation ratio' (S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine) of the FA content groups reached similar values, which were significantly higher compared to the deficient group. The brain 'methylation ratio', however, remained unmodified independently of FA content in the diet. FA deficiency induced hepatic DNA hypomethylation, and supranormal FA supplementation exerted the most protective effect (p &lt; 0.01). Serum folate levels increased according to FA dietary level, whereas no differences were seen for vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(6). CONCLUSIONS: FA deficiency compromises methionine metabolism whereas supplementation does not show an additional positive effect compared to the control diet in growing animals.",M1
20117198,"Folate mediated histidine derivative of quaternised chitosan as a gene delivery vector.Folate targeted gene delivery vectors showed enhanced accumulation in folate receptor expressing tumor model. In the present work, the water solubility and transfection efficiency of chitosans were improved by modifying the depolymerised trimethylated chitosans with histidine moiety. Folate mediated targeting was induced by conjugating poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEG-<e>FA</e>) on histidine modified chitosan polymer having low molecular weight of 15 kDa and high degree of quaternisation (HTFP15-H). The zeta potential and size of the HTFP15-H/pDNA nanoparticles were determined using dynamic light scattering technique and the results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology of the nanoparticles was found spherical in shape having core-shell nanostructure. The HTFP15-H derivative found to buffer in the pH range from 10 to 4. The blood compatibility in terms of percentage hemolysis, erythrocyte aggregation and also by platelet activation was found to be significantly improved compared to the control vector PEI. At a concentration of 10 microg the derivative promote the cell growth up to 139% compared to control at normal cell growing conditions. The transfection efficiency in KB cell line, which over expresses the folate receptor (FR) in presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was also found to be comparable to the control. Moreover the enhanced cellular and nuclear uptake due to the conjugation of both folic acid and histidine makes it a potential vector for gene delivery applications.",M1
20060418,"Folic acid and soybean isoflavone combined supplementation protects the post-neural tube closure defects of rodents induced by cyclophosphamide in vivo and in vitro.To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and soybean isoflavone (SIF) combined supplementation on the post-neural tube closure of rodents induced by cyclophosphamide (CPA) in vitro and in vivo, pregnant rats were randomly divided into control, model, solo-FA intervention, solo-SIF intervention and co-intervention of FA and SIF groups. Rats in solo-intervention groups and co-intervention group were treated with FA 0.7 mg/kg, SIF 160 mg/kg and FA 0.7 mg/kg+SIF 160 mg/kg at the duration of pregnancy, respectively. On the 13th day of gestation, control rats were given physiological saline and the other four groups were treated with CPA12.5mg/kg. On the 14th day of gestation, three rats selected randomly from every group were executed and the ultrastructure, DNA damage and the proteins expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and P53 on embryo brains were checked. The rest of the rats were executed on the 20th day, the frequency of neural tube closure defects and fetus' development indices were measured. In addition, T-SOD, MDA and NO in serum of the pregnant rats were checked. In vitro, the effect of FA and genistein on the apoptosis was determined. Compared with the model group, the malformation incidence was lower but fetus' development indices were higher in the combination treated group. The combination decreased the damage of CPA, such as damaged nuclear DNA, early apoptotic morphological changes, Bax and P53 expressions on embryo brains and in vivo. Furthermore, T-SOD activity in serum of the pregnant rats increased and the levels of MDA and NO decreased in the combined supplementation group. Our study indicates the neuroprotection of FA and SIF combined administration is superior to solo treatment. Decrease of DNA damage and neuron apoptosis involved in the mechanisms. Furthermore, the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and the down-regulation of Bax and P53 proteins also participate in the effect.",M1
20054435,"Optimization of the preparation process of vinblastine sulfate (VBLS)-loaded folate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles for tumor-targeted drug delivery using response surface methodology (RSM).Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the process of preparing bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles by desolvation, then the resulting BSA nanoparticles (BSANPs) were conjugated with folate to produce a drug carrier system that can specifically target tumors. The anticancer drug, vinblastine sulfate (VBLS), was loaded to this tumor-specific drug carrier system for the purpose of overcoming the nonspecific targeting characteristics and side effects of the drug. A central composite design was applied for modeling the process, which was composed of four independent variables, namely BSA concentration, the rate of adding ethanol (ethanol rate), ethanol amount, and the degree of crosslinking. The mean particle size and residual amino groups of the BSANPs were chosen as response variables. The interactive effects of the four independent variables on the response variables were studied. The characteristics of the nanoparticles; such as amount of folate conjugation, drug entrapment efficiency, drug-loading efficiency, surface morphology and release kinetics in vitro were investigated. Optimum conditions for preparing desired BSANPs, with a mean particle size of 156.6 nm and residual amino groups of 668.973 nM/mg, were obtained. The resulting folate-conjugated BSANPs (<e>FA</e>-BSANPs) showed a drug entrapment efficiency of 84.83% and drug-loading efficiency of 42.37%, respectively, and the amount of folate conjugation was 383.996 microM/g BSANPs. The results of this study indicate that using FA-BSANPs as a drug carrier system could be effective in targeting VBLS-sensitive tumors in the future.",M1
20036904,"Emax model and interaction index for assessing drug interaction in combination studies.Applying the Emax model in a Lowe additivity model context, we analyze data from a combination study of trimetrexate (TMQ) and AG2034 (AG) in media of low and high concentrations of folic acid (<e>FA</e>). The Emax model provides a sufficient fit to the data. TMQ is more potent than AG in both low and high FA media. At low TMQ:AG ratios, when a smaller amount of the more potent drug (TMQ) is added to a larger amount of the less potent drug (AG), synergy results. When the TMQ:AG ratio reaches 0.4 or larger in low FA medium, or when the TMQ:AG ratio reaches 1 or larger in high FA medium, synergy is weakened and drug interaction becomes additive. In general, synergistic effect in a dilution series is stronger at higher doses that produce stronger effects (closer to 1-Emax) than at lower dose levels that produce weaker effects (closer to 1). The two drugs are more potent in the low compared to the high FA medium. Drug synergy, however, is stronger in the high FA medium.",M1
20035998,"A molecular receptor targeted, hydroxyapatite nanocrystal based multi-modal contrast agent.Multi-modal molecular imaging can significantly improve the potential of non-invasive medical diagnosis by combining basic anatomical descriptions with in-depth phenotypic characteristics of disease. Contrast agents with multifunctional properties that can sense and enhance the signature of specific molecular markers, together with high biocompatibility are essential for combinatorial molecular imaging approaches. Here, we report a multi-modal contrast agent based on hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (nHAp), which is engineered to show simultaneous contrast enhancement for three major molecular imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray imaging and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. Monodispersed nHAp crystals of average size approximately 30 nm and hexagonal crystal structure were in situ doped with multiple rare-earth impurities by a surfactant-free, aqueous wet-chemical method at 100 degrees C. Doping of nHAp with Eu(3+) (3 at%) resulted bright near-infrared fluorescence (700 nm) due to efficient (5)D(0)-(7)F(4) electronic transition and co-doping with Gd(3+) resulted enhanced paramagnetic longitudinal relaxivity (r(1) approximately 12 mM(-1) s(-1)) suitable for T(1) weighted MR imaging together with approximately 80% X-ray attenuation suitable for X-ray contrast imaging. Capability of MF-nHAp to specifically target and enhance the signature of molecular receptors (folate) in cancer cells was realized by carbodiimide grafting of cell-membrane receptor ligand folic acid (<e>FA</e>) on MF-nHAp surface aminized with dendrigraft polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI). The FA-PEI-MF-nHAp conjugates showed specific aggregation on FR(+ve) cells while leaving the negative control cells untouched. Nanotoxicity evaluation of this multifunctional nHAp carried out on primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC), normal mouse lung fibroblast cell line (L929), human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) and human lung cancer cell line (A549) revealed no apparent toxicity even upto relatively higher doses of 500 microg/mL and 48 h of incubation. Flow-cytometry based reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis also showed no significant levels of ROS generation in the nHAp treated cells. The tri-modal contrast imaging functionality together with molecular receptor targeting capability and biocompatibility makes MF-nHAp a promising biomineral contrast agent for combinatorial molecular imaging.",M1
20033930,"Functional graphene oxide as a nanocarrier for controlled loading and targeted delivery of mixed anticancer drugs.A simple synthetic route for the preparation of functional nanoscale graphene oxide (NGO), a novel nanocarrier for the loading and targeted delivery of anticancer drugs, is reported. The NGO is functionalized with sulfonic acid groups, which render it stable in physiological solution, followed by covalent binding of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) molecules to the NGO, thus allowing it to specifically target MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells with FA receptors. Furthermore, controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT), onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) via pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions is investigated. It is demonstrated that FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 cells, and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to NGO loaded with either DOX or CPT only. Considering that the combined use of two or more drugs, a widely adopted clinical practice, often displays much better therapeutic efficacy than that of a single drug, the controlled loading and targeted delivery of mixed anticancer drugs using these graphene-based nanocarriers may find widespread application in biomedicine.",M1
20023317,"Molecular-receptor-specific, non-toxic, near-infrared-emitting Au cluster-protein nanoconjugates for targeted cancer imaging.Molecular-receptor-targeted imaging of folate receptor positive oral carcinoma cells using folic-acid-conjugated fluorescent Au(25) nanoclusters (Au NCs) is reported. Highly fluorescent Au(25) clusters were synthesized by controlled reduction of Au(+) ions, stabilized in bovine serum albumin (BSA), using a green-chemical reducing agent, ascorbic acid (vitamin-C). For targeted-imaging-based detection of cancer cells, the clusters were conjugated with folic acid (<e>FA</e>) through amide linkage with the BSA shell. The bioconjugated clusters show excellent stability over a wide range of pH from 4 to 14 and fluorescence efficiency of approximately 5.7% at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), indicating effective protection of nanoclusters by serum albumin during the bioconjugation reaction and cell-cluster interaction. The nanoclusters were characterized for their physico-chemical properties, toxicity and cancer targeting efficacy in vitro. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests binding energies correlating to metal Au 4f(7/2) approximately 83.97 eV and Au 4f(5/2) approximately 87.768 eV. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of individual nanoclusters of size approximately 1 nm and protein cluster aggregates of size approximately 8 nm. Photoluminescence studies show bright fluorescence with peak maximum at approximately 674 nm with the spectral profile covering the near-infrared (NIR) region, making it possible to image clusters at the 700-800 nm emission window where the tissue absorption of light is minimum. The cell viability and reactive oxygen toxicity studies indicate the non-toxic nature of the Au clusters up to relatively higher concentrations of 500 microg ml(-1). Receptor-targeted cancer detection using Au clusters is demonstrated on FR(+ve) oral squamous cell carcinoma (KB) and breast adenocarcinoma cell MCF-7, where the FA-conjugated Au(25) clusters were found internalized in significantly higher concentrations compared to the negative control cell lines. This study demonstrates the potential of using non-toxic fluorescent Au nanoclusters for the targeted imaging of cancer.",M1
20014825,"Arabinogalactan-folic acid-drug conjugate for targeted delivery and target-activated release of anticancer drugs to folate receptor-overexpressing cells.Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is a high affinity ligand (K(d) = 0.1-1 nM) of folate receptors (FRs) responsible for cellular uptake of folates via receptor-mediated endocytosis. FRs are frequently overexpressed in malignant epithelial cells including ovary, brain, kidney, breast, colon, and lung. FR has emerged as a target for the differential-delivery of anticancer chemotherapeutics with several FA-linked therapeutic agents currently undergoing clinical trials. Here we show that by tethering both FA and the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) to arabinogalactan (AG), a highly branched natural polysaccharide with unusual water solubility, a targeted biomacromolecular nanovehicle is formed, which can differentially deliver a cytotoxic cargo into FR-overexpressing cells. Moreover, by linking MTX via an endosomally cleavable peptide (GFLG), we demonstrate a target-activated release mechanism. This FA-AG-GFLG-MTX drug conjugate displayed 6.3-fold increased cytotoxic activity to FR-overexpressing cells compared to their FR-lacking counterparts. These findings establish a novel FA-tethered polymeric nanoconjugate for the targeted delivery of antitumor agents into cancer cells overexpressing FR.",M1
20010426,"Targeting the efficacy of a dendrimer-based nanotherapeutic in heterogeneous xenograft tumors in vivo.Our earlier studies have shown the in vitro and in vivo targeting of a generation 5 (G5) dendrimer-based multifunctional conjugate that contained folic acid (<e>FA</e>) as the targeting agent and methotrexate (MTX) as the chemotherapeutic drug. To clinically apply the synthesized G5-FA-MTX nanotherapeutic, it is important that the anticancer conjugate elicits cytotoxicity specifically and consistently. Toward this objective, we evaluated the large-scale synthesis of a G5-FA-MTX conjugate (Lot # 123-34) for its cytotoxic potential and specificity in vitro and in vivo. The cytotoxicity and specificity were tested by using a coculture assay in which FA receptor-expressing and nonexpressing cells (KB and SK-BR-3 cells, respectively) were cultured together and preferential killing was examined. The in-vitro data were compared with the in-vivo data obtained from a heterogeneous xenograft tumor model. The animal model of the artificial heterogeneous xenograft tumor showed that the nanotherapeutic was preferentially cytotoxic to KB cells.",M1
19969347,"A specific tumor-targeting magnetofluorescent nanoprobe for dual-modality molecular imaging.Poly(acrylic acid) was decorated onto Fe(3)O(4) resulting in a highly water-soluble superparamagnetic iron oxide. The Poly(acrylic acid) iron oxide (PAAIO) complexes possess specific magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field and are attractive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The free carboxylic groups of PAAIO exposed on the surface allow for covalent attachment of a fluorescent dye, Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) to form PAAIO-Rh123, which permits applications in fluorescence imaging. PAAIO-Rh123 is therefore a dual-modality molecular probe. In order to endow specific properties to compounds that target cancer cells and to prevent recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), folic acid-linked poly(ethylene glycol) (<e>FA</e>-PEG) was further conjugated onto PAAIO-Rh123. The amounts of Rh123 and FA-PEG on the modified iron oxides were quantitatively determined by elemental analysis. The iron content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The particle diameters were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Superparamagnetism was confirmed by the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The cellular internalization efficacy of the modified iron oxides was realized in folate-overexpressed FR(+) and folate-deficient FR(-) KB cells by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The quantitative amount of iron internalized into different harvested KB cells was measured by ICP-OES. The T(2)-weighted MR images were tested in FR(+) KB cells.",M1
19917061,"[6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate increases plasma folate more effectively than folic acid in women with the homozygous or wild-type 677C--&gt;T polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is responsible for the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). The 677C--&gt;T mutation of MTHFR reduces the activity of this enzyme. The aim of this study was, first, to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of [6S]-5-MTHF and folic acid (<e>FA</e>) in women with the homozygous (TT) and wild-type (CC) 677C--&gt;T mutation, and second, to explore genotype differences. The metabolism of [6S]-5-MTHF and FA was evaluated by measuring plasma folate derivatives. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Healthy females (TT, n= 16; CC, n= 8) received a single oral dose of FA (400 microg) and [6S]-5-MTHF (416 microg) in a randomized crossover design. Plasma folate was measured up to 8 h after supplementation. Concentration-time-profile [area under the curve of the plasma folate concentration vs. time (AUC)], maximum concentration (C(max)) and time-to-reach-maximum (t(max)) were calculated. KEY RESULTS: AUC and C(max) were significantly higher, and t(max) significantly shorter for [6S]-5-MTHF compared with FA in both genotypes. A significant difference between the genotypes was observed for t(max) after FA only (P &lt; 0.05). Plasma folate consisted essentially of 5-MTHF irrespective of the folate form given. Unmetabolized FA in plasma occurs regularly following FA supplementation, but rarely with [6S]-5-MTHF. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that [6S]-5-MTHF increases plasma folate more effectively than FA irrespective of the 677C--&gt;T mutation of the MTHFR. This natural form of folate could be an alternative to FA supplementation or fortification.",M1
19910320,"Prevalence and predictors of periconceptional folic acid uptake--prospective cohort study in an Irish urban obstetric population.BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe abnormalities of the central nervous system that occur as a result of abnormal development in the third and fourth weeks of gestation. Studies have shown that periconceptional folic acid (<e>FA</e>) can reduce both the incidence and recurrence of NTDs. METHODS: A cohort study was carried out using the electronic hospital booking records of women delivering in a large Dublin maternity hospital between 2000 and 2007. Logistic regression analyses were performed to measure the associations between maternal factors and optimal FA use. RESULTS: Of the 61,252 women in the cohort, 85% reported taking FA at some point during the periconceptional period; however, only 28% took FA as recommended. Factors associated with taking the recommended amount of FA included nulliparity [adjusted OR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.28-1.43)], early booking (&lt;12 weeks) [OR: 1.24 (95% CI: 1.17-1.31)], increasing maternal age (e.g. 30-34 years) [OR: 1.39 (95% CI: 1.30-1.48)], private health care [OR: 4.32 (95% CI: 4.1-4.6)] and fertility treatment [OR: 2.88 (95% CI: 2.44-3.40)]. Factors associated with taking less than recommended or no FA included unplanned pregnancy [OR: 0.08 (0.07-0.08)], lower socio-economic status (e.g. unemployed) [OR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.71)], non-Irish nationality [OR: 0.82 (0.74-0.90)] and smokers [OR: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.47-0.55)]. CONCLUSIONS: Social, demographic and economic factors have an important influence on the FA uptake. Vulnerable groups who report limited uptake of FA need to be specifically targeted in future Public Health campaigns and further consideration needs to be given to the debate on food fortification in countries where this is currently not available.",M1
19849871,"Role of zinc along with ascorbic acid and folic acid during long-term in vitro albumin glycation.The present study aimed to investigate the role of Zn alone and in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and folic acid (<e>FA</e>) in albumin glycation. Glycation was performed by incubations of bovine serum albumin with glucose at 37 degrees C along with Zn, AA or FA separately and Zn + AA or Zn + FA for 150 d. Glycation-mediated modifications were monitored as fluorescence of advanced glycation endproducts, carbonyl formation, beta aggregation (thioflavin T and Congo red dyes), albumin-bound Zn, thiol groups and glycated aggregate's toxicity in HepG2 cells. Zn inhibited glycation and beta aggregation, probably due to observed higher protein-bound Zn. It also protected protein thiols and increased cell survival. AA and FA enhanced glycation, which was lowered in Zn-co-incubated samples. FA increased albumin-bound Zn and showed maximum cell survival. Although these results warrant further in vivo investigation, the present data help in the understanding of the interplay of Zn with micronutrients in albumin glycation.",M1
19793860,"Periconceptional iron supplementation does not reduce anemia or improve iron status among pregnant women in rural Bangladesh.BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in periconceptional iron supplementation in developing countries by researchers and policy makers; however, there are no randomized controlled trials that examine the effectiveness of this strategy in decreasing anemia during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine whether periconceptional iron supplementation reduces anemia during pregnancy. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in rural Bangladesh. Married, nulliparous women were randomly assigned to receive daily iron and folic acid (IFA; 60 mg ferrous fumarate and 400 microg folic acid) (n = 134) or folic acid (<e>FA</e>; 400 microg) (n = 138) in the form of a powdered supplement added to food. Women were followed until pregnancy or the end of 9 mo. Primary outcomes included hemoglobin, plasma ferritin, and plasma transferrin receptor concentrations. RESULTS: Among 88 pregnant women, periconceptional IFA in comparison with FA did not affect anemia or iron status at 15 wk gestation. However, each 1% increase in adherence was associated with a 10-g/L increase in change in hemoglobin from baseline (P = 0.03), and those who initiated supplementation at a mean (+/-SD) time of 72.9 +/- 57.8 d before conception showed a 7.3-g/L increase in change in hemoglobin from baseline compared with those who initiated supplementation at 26.3 +/- 12.3 d after conception (P = 0.01). Among 146 nonpregnant women, IFA decreased anemia (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.95) and improved iron stores (P = 0.001) more than did FA. CONCLUSION: Good adherence and initiation of supplementation before conception are needed to reduce anemia during early pregnancy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00953134.",M1
19743434,"Receptor-mediated cellular uptake of folate-conjugated fluorescent nanodiamonds: a combined ensemble and single-particle study.Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) are nontoxic and photostable nanomaterials, ideal for long-term in vivo imaging applications. This paper reports that FNDs with a size of approximately 140 nm can be covalently conjugated with folic acid (<e>FA</e>) for receptor-mediated targeting of cancer cells at the single-particle level. The conjugation is made by using biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol, as crosslinked buffer layers. Ensemble-averaged measurements with flow cytometry indicate that more than 50% of the FA-conjugated FND particles can be internalized by the cells (such as HeLa cells) through receptor-mediated endocytosis, as confirmed by competitive inhibition assays. Confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals that these FND particles accumulate in the perinuclear region. The absolute number of FNDs internalized by HeLa cells after 3 h of incubation at a particle concentration of 10 microg mL(-1) is in the range of 100 particles per cell. The receptor-mediated uptake process is further elucidated by single-particle tracking of 35-nm FNDs in three dimensions and real time during the endocytosis.",M1
19736473,"Efficacy of folate and vitamin B12 in lowering homocysteine concentrations in hemodialysis patients.To evaluate the efficacy of supplementation with high dose folic acid with and without vitamin B 12 in lowering plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in hemodialysis (HD) patients, we studied 36 HD patients randomized into four groups according to the received therapeutic regimen: group I (only folic acid (<e>FA</e>), 5 mg/day), group II (FA, 5 mg/day + vitamin B 12 , 1 mg/day) group III (only FA, 15 mg/day), group IV (FA, 15 mg/day, vitamin B 12 , 1 mg/day) for a period of 8 weeks. Plasma tHcy and serum FA and vitamin B 12 levels were measured at baseline and after the supplementation period. Dietary intakes were assessed during the study period. At baseline, 27.8% of the patients had normal levels of tHcy and 72.2% had hyperhomocysteinemia. After supplementation, plasma tHcy increased by 1.35% in group I and decreased by 6.99%, 14.54% and 30.09% in groups II, III and IV respectively, which was only significant in group IV (P= 0.014). The patients did not show any significant changes in serum folic acid, but a significant change in serum vitamin B 12 in group IV (P= 0.006). Percentage of patients reaching normal levels of plasma tHcy was 5.6 fold higher in group IV than in the reference group (group I). No correlations were found between changes of plasma tHcy levels and dietary intakes. We conclude that oral supplementation with 15 mg/day folic acid together with 1 mg/day of vitamin B 12 is effective in reducing tHcy levels in HD patients. These supplements also have a desirable effect on serum folic acid and vitamin B12.",M1
19697373,"One-step synthesis of folic acid protected gold nanoparticles and their receptor-mediated intracellular uptake.We report here a facile method to obtain folic acid (<e>FA</e>)-protected gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) by heating an aqueous solution of HAuCl(4)/FA in which FA acts as both the reducing and stabilizing agent. The successful formation of FA-protected Au NPs is demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The intracellular uptake of these nanoparticles is facilitated by HeLa cells overexpressing the folate reporter, which itself is significantly inhibited by free FA in a competitive assay as quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). This simple one-step approach affords a new perspective for creating functional nanomaterials, and the resulting biocompatible, functional Au NPs may find some prospective applications in various biomedical fields.",M1
19692428,"Differential usage of the transport systems for folic acid and methotrexate in normal human T-lymphocytes and leukemic cells.Methotrexate (MTX) has been used as an effective anti-cancer drug for a long time. Conceptually, it is accepted that MTX and folic acid are transported by folate receptors (FRs) in cancerous cells, but the exact mechanism of MTX uptake in human leukemia is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate different transport systems for <e>FA</e> and MTX, and to delineate their uptake mechanism in MOLT4, K562, Hut78 leukemia cells and normal human T cells. In MOLT4, uptake of MTX was higher than FA, similar to that of K562, Hut78 and normal T cells. In MOLT4 cells, MTX uptake was maximum at pH 7.4 whereas FA uptake was maximum at pH 4.5. Uptake of FA and MTX was significantly inhibited by anions, suggesting anion-dependent transport system. FA uptake was found to be energy dependent whereas MTX uptake was energy independent. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence results demonstrated the presence of reduced folate carrier as well as proton coupled folate transporter and absence of FR in MOLT4 and normal T cells. These data suggest the existence of two separate and independent carrier-mediated transport systems for the uptake of FA and MTX in normal and leukemic human T cells.",M1
19680705,"Effect of water soluble vitamins on Zn transport of Caco-2 cells and their implications under oxidative stress conditions.BACKGROUND: The role of different water soluble vitamins in Zn metabolism beyond intestinal Zn absorption is poorly explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: Using Caco-2 cells, effects of different vitamins on intestinal Zn transport and their implications under oxidative stress (OS) were investigated. METHODS: Cells were apically treated with Zn (25 muM) and vitamins (Folic acid (<e>FA</e>), Nicotinic acid (NA), Ascorbic acid (AA), riboflavin, thiamine, pyridoxine) for 60 min. The effect of most promising vitamins on zinc transport, antioxidant enzymes (Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase), and intracellular OS status (ROS generation and mitochondrial transmembrane potential) were investigated. OS was generated by tert-butyl hydro peroxide and results for each vitamin were compared with respective Zn containing controls with and without OS. RESULTS: Without OS, Zn transport was slightly enhanced in presence of NA, while it was significantly reduced by thiamine, riboflavin, and pyridoxine. Under OS, NA significantly (P &lt; 0.01) enhanced Zn transport in dose-dependent manner, while, pyridoxine and AA moderately improved it. Under both conditions, Zn transport exhibited decreasing trend with increase of FA. The antioxidant enzyme and OS markers levels varied significantly in Zn + vitamins. With Zn + FA + OS, enzyme activities decreased maximally, with twofold increase in 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) (P &lt; 0.01) and lowering of rhodamine fluorescence (P &lt; 0.05). In Zn + AA + OS, DCF-DA fluorescence increased (P &lt; 0.05) but with NA, cellular enzymes, and antioxidant profile were improved. CONCLUSIONS: Results for the first time demonstrate advantageous effects of NA and deleterious consequences of FA with no effect by AA on Zn transport, especially under OS. These observed changes in the transport of Zn seem to have an impact on OS markers.",M1
19680678,"Effects of folic acid and homocysteine on spinal cord morphology of the chicken embryo.Maternal ingestion of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) reduces neural tube defects, which are associated with high homocysteine levels. Present study evaluated the effects of FA and homocysteine on cell proliferation and cell adhesion, as well as on apoptosis, throughout the development of the spinal cord and mesenchyme of chicken embryos. Normal closure of the neural tube and a regular distribution of the mesenchymal cells were observed in control and FA-treated embryos. All homocysteine-treated embryos and also 6 of 10 embryos treated with FA+homocysteine showed failure of closure of the neural tube. Homocysteine decreased the thickness of the mantle and marginal layers of the spinal cord, and FA did not prevent this effect. FA treatment reversed the decrease of proliferating cells in the spinal cord induced by homocysteine. FA-treated embryos showed the highest numerical density of apoptotic cells. Homocysteine treatment reduced NCAM expression in both spinal cord and mesenchymal tissue, and FA prevents this effect. These results are important because they demonstrate in situ that the imbalance between FA and homocysteine levels can lead to disruptions in spinal cord development, changing proliferation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion and consequently changing the arrangement of the spinal cord layers.",M1
19674777,"Gold nanoparticles with a monolayer of doxorubicin-conjugated amphiphilic block copolymer for tumor-targeted drug delivery.Gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with a monolayer of folate-conjugated poly(L-aspartate-doxorubicin)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer (Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/<e>FA</e>) was synthesized as a tumor-targeted drug delivery carrier. The Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA NPs consist of an Au core, a hydrophobic poly(l-aspartate-doxorubicin) (P(LA-DOX)) inner shell, and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) and folate-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) outer shell (PEG-OH/FA). The anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), was covalently conjugated onto the hydrophobic inner shell by acid-cleavable hydrazone linkage. The DOX loading level was determined to be 17 wt%. The Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA NPs formed stable unimolecular micelles in aqueous solution. The size of the Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA micelles were determined as 24-52 and 10-25 nm by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The conjugated DOX was released from the Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA micelles much more rapidly at pH 5.3 and 6.6 than at pH 7.4, which is a desirable characteristic for tumor-targeted drug delivery. Cellular uptake of the Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA micelles facilitated by the folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis process was higher than that of the micelles without folate. This was consistent with the higher cytotoxicity observed with the Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA micelles against the 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line. These results suggest that Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/FA NPs could be used as a carrier with pH-triggered drug releasing properties for tumor-targeted drug delivery.",M1
19668108,"Comparison of the transport characteristics of bioactive substances in IUGR and normal placentas.Knowing that IUGR is associated with altered placental transport, we aimed to characterize the placental transport of folic acid (<e>FA</e>), thiamine (THIAM), serotonin (5-HT), and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in IUGR. For this, we compared the transport characteristics of (3)H-FA, (3)H-THIAM, (3)H-5-HT, and (3)H-MPP+ in primary cultured human cytotrophoblasts isolated from IUGR and normal placentas (GRTB and NTB cells, respectively) and quantified mRNA expression of several placental transporters, by real-time RT-PCR. Our results show that GRTB cells take up (3)H-FA more efficiently (higher k(in) and A(max) values) and have higher transport capacity (higher V(max) values) for (3)H-FA, (3)H-5-HT, and (3)H-MPP+, when compared with NTB cells. In addition, GRTB cells take up (3)H-THIAM with higher affinity and (3)H-MPP+ with lower affinity than NTB cells. Finally, IUGR placentas have a generalized increase in mRNA expression of FA, THIAM, 5-HT, and MPP+ transporters, when compared with normal placentas, suggesting that the increase in transport capacity may be due to increased expression of placental transporters. These results point to an effect of  compensation for the weakness  of the IUGR placenta and pose the placenta as an active mediator of the communication between maternal and fetal environments.",M1
19660467,"Mechanistic insights into folic acid-dependent vascular protection: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-mediated reduction in oxidant stress in endothelial cells and angiotensin II-infused mice: a novel HPLC-based fluorescent assay for DHFR activity.Folate supplementation improves endothelial function in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia. Mechanistic insights into potential benefits of folate on vascular function in general population however, remain mysterious. Expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was markedly increased by folic acid (<e>FA</e>, 50 micromol/L, 24 h) treatment in endothelial cells. Tetrahydrofolate (THF) is formed after incubation of purified DHFR or cellular extracts with 50 micromol/L of substrate dihydrofolic acid. THF could then be detected and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescent detector (295/365 nm). Using this novel and sensitive assay, we found that DHFR activity was significantly increased by FA. Furthermore, FA improved redox status of Ang II treated cells by increasing H(4)B and NO() bioavailability while decreasing superoxide (O(2)(-)) production. It however failed to restore NO() levels in DHFR siRNA-transfected or methotrexate pre-treated cells, implicating a specific and intermediate role of DHFR. In mice orally administrated with FA (15 mg/kg/day, 16 days), endothelial upregulation of DHFR expression and activity occurred in correspondence to improved NO() and H(4)B bioavailability, and this was highly effective in reducing Ang II infusion (0.7 mg/kg/day, 14 days)-stimulated aortic O(2)(-) production. 5'-methyltetrahydrofolate (5'-MTHF) levels, GTPCH1 expression and activity remained unchanged in response to FA or Ang II treatment in vitro and in vivo. FA supplementation improves endothelial NO() bioavailability via upregulation of DHFR expression and activity, and protects endothelial cells from Ang II-provoked oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo. These observations likely represent a novel mechanism (intermediate role of DHFR) whereby FA induces vascular protection.",M1
19660435,"Structure-function analysis of the highly conserved charged residues of the membrane protein FT1, the main folic acid transporter of the protozoan parasite Leishmania.The main plasma membrane folate transporter FT1 of Leishmania belongs to the novel FBT family which is part of the major facilitator superfamily. We have investigated the role of the 10 most conserved charged amino acids of FBTs by site directed mutagenesis. The functions of the mutated proteins were tested for their capacity to transport <e>FA</e>, to sensitize methotrexate resistant cells to methotrexate, for protein production, and for protein localisation. Of the 10 conserved charged amino acids that were mutated to neutral amino acids, all had effects on FT1 transport activities. Only four of the 10 initial mutants (K116L, K133L, R497L, and D529V) retained between 15% and 50% of FT1 activity. The R497 residue was shown to be involved in substrate binding. When the charged conserved residues at position 124, 134, 179, 514, 537 and 565 were changed to neutral amino acids, this led to inactive proteins but the generation of new mutants D124E, R134K, D514E and D537E regained between 20% and 50% of wild-type FT1 activity suggesting that the charge is important for protein function. The mutated protein D179E had, under our standard experimental conditions, no activity, while E565D was completely inactive. The differential activity of the mutated proteins was due either to changes in the apparent K(m) or V(max). Mutagenesis experiments have revealed that charged amino acids were essential for FT1 stability or activity and led to a plausible model for the transport of folic acid through FT1.",M1
19643474,"Targeted delivery and controlled release of doxorubicin to cancer cells using modified single wall carbon nanotubes.A targeted drug delivery system that is triggered by changes in pH based on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), derivatized with carboxylate groups and coated with a polysaccharide material, can be loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The drug binds at physiological pH (pH 7.4) and is only released at a lower pH, for example, lysosomal pH and the pH characteristic of certain tumor environments. By manipulating the surface potentials of the modified nanotubes through modification of the polysaccharide coating, both the loading efficiency and release rate of the associated DOX can be controlled. Folic acid (<e>FA</e>), a targeting agent for many tumors, can be additionally tethered to the SWCNTs to selectively deliver DOX into the lysosomes of HeLa cells with much higher efficiency than free DOX. The DOX released from the modified nanotubes has been shown to damage nuclear DNA and inhibit the cell proliferation.",M1
19638421,"Folate rescues lithium-, homocysteine- and Wnt3A-induced vertebrate cardiac anomalies.Elevated plasma homocysteine (HCy), which results from folate (folic acid, <e>FA</e>) deficiency, and the mood-stabilizing drug lithium (Li) are both linked to the induction of human congenital heart and neural tube defects. We demonstrated previously that acute administration of Li to pregnant mice on embryonic day (E)6.75 induced cardiac valve defects by potentiating Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. We hypothesized that HCy may similarly induce cardiac defects during gastrulation by targeting the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway. Because dietary FA supplementation protects from neural tube defects, we sought to determine whether FA also protects the embryonic heart from Li- or HCy-induced birth defects and whether the protection occurs by impacting Wnt signaling. Maternal elevation of HCy or Li on E6.75 induced defective heart and placental function on E15.5, as identified non-invasively using echocardiography. This functional analysis of HCy-exposed mouse hearts revealed defects in tricuspid and semilunar valves, together with altered myocardial thickness. A smaller embryo and placental size was observed in the treated groups. FA supplementation ameliorates the observed developmental errors in the Li- or HCy-exposed mouse embryos and normalized heart function. Molecular analysis of gene expression within the avian cardiogenic crescent determined that Li, HCy or Wnt3A suppress Wnt-modulated Hex (also known as Hhex) and Islet-1 (also known as Isl1) expression, and that FA protects from the gene misexpression that is induced by all three factors. Furthermore, myoinositol with FA synergistically enhances the protective effect. Although the specific molecular epigenetic control mechanisms remain to be defined, it appears that Li or HCy induction and FA protection of cardiac defects involve intimate control of the canonical Wnt pathway at a crucial time preceding, and during, early heart organogenesis.",M1
19630087,"Determination of folic acid by high-performance liquid chromatography with direct electrogenerated chemiluminescence reaction.In our present work, it was found that the electrooxidation of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) was accompanied by electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) emission.

Coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography separation, this simple ECL method was used for post-column determination of FA. Under the optimal conditions, the ECL intensity has a linear relationship with the concentration of FA in the range of 1.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-5) g/mL and the detection limit was 5 x 10(-8) g/mL (signal-to-noise ratio = 3).

The morphology and particle size of the nanoparticles were determined by atomic force microscope (AFM). HPLC was used to analyse the entrapment efficiency and drug loading rate of EGCG The amount of folate conjugation on the BSANP was determined by quantitative ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer analysis. The targeting ability to PC-3 was observed using laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) and fluorophotometer microscope. And the activity of FA-EGCG-BSANP was mensurated by MTT method. The morphology and particle size distribution of FA-EGCG-BSANP were uniform and even with the mean particle size of 200 nm. The entrapment efficiency and loading rate of EGCG were (81.5 +/- 1.8) % and (29.3 +/- 0.6) %, respectively, and the amount of folate conjugation was 18.363 microg x mg(-1) BSA. The FA-EGCG-BSANP uptakes by cultured PC-3 cells were 23.65 times the amount of EGCG-BSANP in a concentration dependant manner. The lethality of PC-3 cells treated with FA-EGCG-BSA was 82.8%, while those treated with EGCG and EGCG-BSANP were 58.6% and 55.1%, respectively. And lethality of PC-3 cells was positively correlated with the nanoparticles uptake amount. FA-EGCG-BSANP can significantly promote EGCG to PC-3 cells sites and improve their efficacy, which is considered to an experimental foundation for further research on its activity, targeting ability and metabolism in vivo.",M1
19616087,"Folic acid uptake by the human syncytiotrophoblast: interference by pharmacotherapy, drugs of abuse and pathological conditions.Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is crucial for fetal development. We aimed to study the modulation of FA placental uptake by: hyperserotoninemia and hyperglycaemia, anti-hypertensives, insulin and drugs of abuse. For this, we characterized (3)H-FA uptake by primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts (TB cells) and tested the effects of these compounds upon (3)H-FA uptake, TB cell viability and gene expression. Our results show that: (a) acutely, (3)H-FA uptake was decreased by labetalol (0.1-1000 microM), ecstasy and amphetamine (0.025-25 microM); and (b) chronically, (3)H-FA uptake was decreased by high glucose (30 mM), atenolol, nicotine (0.1 and 10 microM), ethanol (0.01 and 10mM), ecstasy, amphetamine (0.25 and 1 microM) and tetrahydrocannabinol (1 and 100 nM). Moreover, many of these drugs were cytotoxic and they differentially modulated the mRNA expression of FA placental transport systems. Our results suggest that inhibition of FA placental uptake may constitute one of the mechanisms involved in the fetotoxicity of many of the compounds tested.",M1
19603491,"Comparison of the internalization of targeted dendrimers and dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles into cancer cells.Dendrimer-based nanotechnology significantly advances the area of targeted cancer imaging and therapy. Herein, we compared the difference of surface acetylated fluorescein isocyanate (FI) and folic acid (<e>FA</e>) modified generation 5 (G5) poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NHAc-FI-FA), and dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles with similar modifications ([(Au(0))(51.2)-G5.NHAc-FI-FA]) in terms of their specific internalization to FA receptor (FAR)-overexpressing cancer cells. Confocal microscopic studies show that both G5.NHAc-FI-FA and [(Au(0))(51.2-)G5.NHAc-FI-FA] exhibit similar internalization kinetics regardless of the existence of Au nanoparticles (NPs). Molecular dynamics simulation of the two different nanostructures reveals that the surface area and the FA moiety distribution from the center of the geometry are slightly different. This slight difference may not be recognized by the FARs on the cell membrane, consequently leading to similar internalization kinetics. This study underlines the fact that metal or inorganic NPs entrapped within dendrimers interact with cells in a similar way to that of dendrimers lacking host NPs.",M1
19591231,"Evaluation of folate-PAMAM for the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides to rat C6 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo.In the current study, we evaluated the efficiency of folate-polyamidoamine dendrimers conjugates (<e>FA</e>-PAMAM) for the in situ delivery of therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides (ASODN) that could inhibit the growth of C6 glioma cells. Folic acid was coupled to the surface amino groups of G5-PAMAM dendrimer (G5D) through a 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide bond, and ASODNs corresponding to rat epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were then complexed with FA-PAMAM. At an ASODN to PAMAM ratio of 16:1, agarose electrophoresis indicated that antisense oligonucleotides were completely complexed with PAMAM or FA-PAMAM. The ASODN transfection rates mediated by FA-PAMAM and PAMAM were superior to oligofectamine, resulting in greater suppression of EGFR expression and glioma cell growth. Stereotactic injection of EGFR ASODN:FA-PAMAM complexes into established rat C6 intracranial gliomas resulted in greater suppression of tumor growth and longer survival time of tumor-bearing rats compared with PAMAM and oligofectamine-mediated EGFR-ASODN therapy. The current study demonstrates the suitability of folate-PAMAM dendrimer conjugates for efficient EGFR ASODN delivery into glioma cells, wherein they release the ASODN from the FA-PAMAM to knock down EGFR expression in C6 glioma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. FA-PAMAM may thus represent a novel delivery system for short oligonucleotides in glioma-targeted therapy.",M1
19560199,"Folic acid-Pluronic F127 magnetic nanoparticle clusters for combined targeting, diagnosis, and therapy applications.Superparamagnetic iron oxides possess specific magnetic properties in the presence of an external magnetic field, which make them an attractive platform as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as carriers for drug delivery. In this study, we investigate the drug delivery and the MRI properties of folate-mediated water-soluble iron oxide incorporated into micelles. Pluronic F127 (PF127), which can be self-assembled into micelles upon increasing concentration or raising temperatures, is used to decorate water-soluble polyacrylic acid-bound iron oxides (PAAIO) via a chemical reaction. Next, the hydrophobic dye Nile red is encapsulated into the hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) compartment of PF127 as a model drug and as a fluorescent agent. Upon encapsulation, PAAIO retains its superparamagnetic characteristics, and thus can be used for MR imaging. A tumor-specific targeting ligand, folic acid (<e>FA</e>), is conjugated onto PF127-PAAIO to produce a multifunctional superparamagnetic iron oxide, FA-PF127-PAAIO. FA-PF127-PAAIO can be simultaneously applied as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent that specifically targets cancer cells that overexpress folate receptors in their cell membranes. PF127-PAAIO is used as a reference group. Based on FTIR and UV-vis absorbance spectra, the successful synthesis of PF127-PAAIO and FA-PF127-PAAIO is realized. The magnetic nanoparticle clusters of PF127-PAAIO and FA-PF127-PAAIO are visualized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). FA-PF127-PAAIO, together with a targeting ligand, displays a higher intracellular uptake into KB cells. This result is confirmed by laser confocal scanning microscopy (CLSM), flow cytometry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) studies. The hysteresis curves, generated by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer analysis, demonstrate that the magnetic nanoparticles are superparamagnetic with insignificant hysteresis. The MTT assay explains the negligible cell cytotoxicity of PF127-PAAIO and FA-PF127-PAAIO. In KB cells, the in vitro MRI study indicates the better T(2)-weighted images in FA-PF127-PAAIO than in PF127-PAAIO.",M1
19540339,"Folate-mediated chondroitin sulfate-Pluronic 127 nanogels as a drug carrier.Pluronic F127 (PF127), one of the polymers which can inhibit drug efflux transporters in cancer therapy, was used to produce amphiphilic nanocarriers for doxorubicin (DOX). In order to stabilize the nanocarriers, the hydroxyl groups on both termini of PF127 were acrylated and reacted with methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (CSMA) to form CS-PF127 nanogel. The introducing CSMA has carboxylic acid groups which can be used to react with a folic acid-polyethylene glycol (<e>FA</e>-PEG). Folic acid, having high binding affinity to tumor-associated folate receptors (FR), provides a selective delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) to FR-positive tumor cells. DOX was loaded either in a cationic DOX.HCl form through the electrostatic interactions with the negative charges of chondroitin sulfate, or in a free DOX form by solubilization into the PPO core compartment of PF127. The loading efficiency and release behavior of DOX prepared from two different formulations are compared. The synthesis of CS-PF127 and FA-PEG grafted CS-PF127 (FA-CS-PF127) was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR), ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (UV), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). With a fluorescent probe technique, the critical aggregation concentrations (CAC) are 7.5 x 10(-2)mg/mL for CS-PF127 and 7.9 x 10(-2)mg/mL for FA-CS-PF127, respectively. The spherical images of nanogels were visualized with the use of the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle diameters measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) are 299.6+/-8.2nm for CS-PF127 and 138.3+/-12.3 for FA-CS-PF127, neither aggregation nor change in sizes in double deionized (DD) water after 20 days. The better cellular uptake of FA-CS-PF127 in KB cells was evidenced by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry upon loading Rhodamine123 as a probe.",M1
19534845,"Neuroprotection of soyabean isoflavone co-administration with folic acid against beta-amyloid 1-40-induced neurotoxicity in rats.Soya isoflavones (SIF) and folic acid (<e>FA</e>) both confer the biological properties of antioxidation; however, the mechanism of their antioxidant effect on nervous system development is unclear. Our purpose is to investigate the neuroprotective effects of SIF, FA or co-administration of SIF with FA against beta-amyloid 1-40 (Abeta1-40)-induced learning and memory impairment in rats. In the present study, the learning and memory ability of rats and the amount of amyloid-positive neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 area were measured. The levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in serum and brain tissue were also measured. The results showed that intracerebroventricular administration of Abeta1-40 resulted in a dramatic prolongation of the escape latency; however, in the SIF, FA and SIF+FA treatment groups, the functional deficits of learning and memory were significantly improved. Moreover, after Abeta1-40 injection, the levels of T-AOC and GSH were profoundly decreased, suggesting a decline of antioxidant activity in the rats. However, intragastric pre-treatment with SIF, or FA, or SIF+FA resulted in a significant increase of antioxidative activity. SIF, or FA, or SIF+FA treatments also reversed the Abeta1-40-induced increase in the amount of amyloid-positive neurons. These results suggest that: (1) learning or memory impairment in experimental rats was caused by Abeta1-40, which is probably attributed to Abeta-induced oxidative damage and deposition of beta-amyloid peptides in the brain; (2) pre-administration of SIF and/or FA may prevent the pathological alterations caused by Abeta1-40 treatment and the neuroprotective effects of SIF and/or FA are indicated.",M1
19534582,"Folate conjugated phosphorylcholine-based polycations for specific targeting in nucleic acids delivery.Folic acid has been investigated as a targeting ligand for imaging and therapeutic agent for over a decade; however, studies on its use in targeting of nonviral gene or nucleic acids delivery systems are sparse. This study assesses potential application of a new folic acid conjugate with aminomethacrylate-phosphoryl-choline based copolymer (DMAEMA-MPC-<e>FA</e>) as a targeting gene delivery vector. The folate-conjugated polymers produce colloidally stable polyplexes with a particle size &lt;200 nm and demonstrate the ability to protect DNA from enzymatic degradation to a certain extent. In cells that overexpress folate receptors (MCF-7 and KB cultures), the conjugated systems show a folate-specific association and achieved significantly enhanced transfection efficiency, compared to the nonconjugated control, with a dramatically reduced nonspecific cellular association. The transfection enhancement is achieved without a corresponding increase in cellular association, suggesting that an internal cellular trafficking of folate-conjugated system may be altered, resulting in an increased transfection efficacy. In summary, a new folate-conjugated aminomethacrylate-phosphorylcholine copolymer is capable of forming colloidal complexes with DNA, modulating their specific cell uptake and improving the level of cell transfection in folate expressing cells.",M1

Bare GC electrode fails to determine the concentration of FA in the presence of AA and UA due to the surface fouling caused by the oxidized products of AA and FA. However, the p-AMT film modified electrode not only separates the voltammetric signals of AA, UA and FA with potential differences of 170 and 410 mV between AA-UA and UA-FA, respectively but also shows higher oxidation current for these analytes. The p-AMT film modified electrode displays an excellent selectivity towards the determination of FA even in the presence of 200-fold AA and 100-fold UA. Using amperometric method, we achieved the lowest detection of 75 nM UA and 100 nM each AA and FA. The amperometric current response was increased linearly with increasing FA concentration in the range of 1.0 x 10(-7)-8.0 x 10(-4)M and the detection limit was found to be 2.3 x 10(-10)M (S/N=3).

Distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol)2000-folic acid (DSPE-PEG2000-FA) was synthesized through carbodiimide-mediated coupling of FA and DSPE-PEG2000-amine and characterized using thin layer chromatography, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Liposomal biolabels were constructed using the synthesized DSPE-PEG2000-FA in conjunction with other phospholipids. A stationary phase having affinity for FA was prepared by covalently linking purified anti-FA monoclonal antibodies onto N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads, which were subsequently packed into a 1.9 cm diameter polypropylene column. The calibration curve for FA had a linear range from 10(-8) to 10(-4) M. The limit of detection was 6.8 ng (equivalent to 500 microL of 3.1 x 10(-8) M FA). The elution buffer (35% methanol in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) also served as the regeneration buffer, which allowed the same column to be used for up to 50 times without any observable loss of reactivity. The immunoaffinity chromatographic column was reusable and capable of concentrating analytes from sample solution; in conjunction with folic acid-sensitized liposomal biolabels, however, they hold great potential as sensitive immunoaffinity assays for the determination for FA. To confirm the feasibility of using this system in the analysis of real samples, the folic acid contents of three over-the-counter vitamin supplements were tested. The recoveries of folic acid of 90-112% for these three samples were obtained, suggesting contents that were consistent with the information obtained from their nutritional facts panels.",M1
19518018,"[Periconceptional use of folic acid in health centers from the territorial sanitary jurisdiction of Tlalpan, Mexico City]BACKGROUND: In 1992, the United States Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Institute of Medicine recommended periconceptional intake of 400 microg of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD) by 70%. Our objective was to assess among pregnant women the periconceptional intake of FA and to assess the level of knowledge among health professionals regarding the benefits associated with FA intake as a preventive measure of NTD. METHODS: We designed a prospective and cross-sectional study to assess certain sociodemographic and reproductive health characteristics, knowledge of periconceptional intake, benefits of FA intake among pregnant women and among health workers. Descriptive statistics was employed. RESULTS: From 200 pregnant women, only 1.7% had taken 400 microg doses of periconceptional FA. Among participating health care personnel only 10.17% knew about the benefits of periconceptional intake of 400 microg of FA. CONCLUSIONS: Periconceptional intake of FA among our sample of pregnant woman was very low and knowledge of its benefits among health professionals was also scarce.",M1
19508863,"Hereditary folate malabsorption: a positively charged amino acid at position 113 of the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) is required for folic acid binding.The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) mediates intestinal folate uptake at acidic pH. Some loss of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) transport mutations in PCFT from hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) patients cluster in R113, thereby suggesting a functional role for this residue. Herein, unlike non-conservative substitutions, an R113H mutant displayed 80-fold increase in the FA transport Km while retaining parental Vmax, hence indicating a major fall in folate substrate affinity. Furthermore, consistent with the preservation of 9% of parental transport activity, R113H transfectants displayed a substantial decrease in the FA growth requirement relative to mock transfectants. Homology modeling based on the crystal structures of the Escherichia coli transporter homologues EmrD and glycerol-3-phosphate transporter revealed that the R113H rotamer properly protrudes into the cytoplasmic face of the minor cleft normally occupied by R113. These findings constitute the first demonstration that a basic amino acid at position 113 is required for folate substrate binding.",M1
19427690,"The use of folate-PEG-grafted-hybranched-PEI nonviral vector for the inhibition of glioma growth in the rat.Combined treatment using nonviral agent-mediated enzyme/prodrug therapy and immunotherapy had been proposed as a powerful alternative method of cancer therapy. The present study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity in vitro and the therapeutic efficacy in vivo when the cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine (CD/5-FC) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) genes were jointly used against rat C6 glioma cells. The potency of the <e>FA</e>-PEG-PEI used as a nonviral vector was tested in the FR-expressed C6 glioma cells and Wistar rats. The C6 glioma cells and animal model were treated by the combined application of FA-PEG-PEI/pCD/5-FC and FA-PEG-PEI/pTRAIL. The antitumor effect was evaluated by survival assays and tumor volume. This study revealed a significant increase of cytotoxicity in vitro following the combined application of FA-PEG-PEI/pCD/5-FC and FA-PEG-PEI/pTRAIL treatments in C6 glioma cells. Animal studies showed a significant growth inhibition of the C6 glioma xenografts using the combined treatment. These results demonstrated that the combined treatment generated additive cytotoxic effect in C6 glioma cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, and indicated that such treatment method using both enzyme/prodrug therapy and TRAIL immunotherapy might be a promising therapeutic strategy in treating glioma.",M1
19372453,"Ethnicity does not affect the homocysteine-lowering effect of B-vitamin therapy in Singaporean stroke patients.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Increased total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for stroke. This study examines whether the efficacy of B-vitamins in reducing tHcy is modified by ethnicity in a Singaporean ischemic stroke population. METHODS: 505 patients (419 Chinese, 41 Malays and 45 Indians) with ischemic stroke were randomized to receive placebo or B-vitamins. Fasting blood samples collected at baseline and 1 year were assayed for tHcy. MTHFR polymorphisms were genotyped. RESULTS: Ethnicity did not independently determine tHcy at baseline. The magnitude of tHcy reduction by B-vitamin treatment was consistent across ethnic groups (Chinese -3.8+/-4.5, Malay -4.9+/-4.2, and Indian -3.3+/-3.6 micromol/L) despite ethnic differences in MTHFR genotype and baseline folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and vitamin B(12) (vitB(12)) concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnicity does not appear to affect the tHcy-lowering effect of B-vitamins, despite differences in dietary intake and prevalence of MTHFR polymorphisms. This suggests that the effect of B-vitamins in lowering tHcy is generalizable across Asian populations. However, due to relatively small numbers of non-Chinese studied, confirmation in other populations is required.",M1
19370751,"Thermosensitive micelles based on folate-conjugated poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) for tumor-targeted drug delivery.Thermosensitive PNVCL-b-PEG block copolymer coupled with folic acid was prepared as an anti-cancer drug carrier. This polymer self-assembled into stable micelles in aqueous solutions at above 33 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the release profile of PNVCL-b-PEG-<e>FA</e> micelles showed a slower and more controlled release of the entrapped 5-FU than that at 25 degrees C. The blank and 5-FU-loaded PNVCL-b-PEG-FA micelles did not induce remarkable cytotoxicity against the EA.hy 926 human endothelial cell line; however, 5-FU-loaded PNVCL-b-PEG-FA micelles showed a cytotoxicity effect against 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells due to the availability of loaded anti-cancer drugs delivered to the inside of the cancer cells by the folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis process.",M1
19359539,"Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of folate and folate catabolites in human serum.BACKGROUND: Folate status is associated with several chronic diseases; thus accurate assessment of folate status has become important in the clinical setting and in epidemiological studies. The diversity of folate forms complicates the task of assaying endogenous folate. We developed and validated an assay that measures various forms of folate in addition to folate catabolites in human serum. METHODS: We added ascorbic acid to serum samples from 168 healthy blood donors and 39 patients with renal failure, and precipitated the proteins with acetonitrile containing (13)C-labeled folate forms as internal standards. The supernatant was evaporated and the analytes redissolved in water. We then used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantify 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5mTHF), 4-alpha-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (hmTHF), folic acid (<e>FA</e>), 5-formyltrahydrofolate (5fTHF), p-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG), and p-acetamidobenzoylglutamate (apABG). RESULTS: Detection limits were 0.07-0.52 nmol/L, and the assay was linear to 140 nmol/L for all analytes. The mean serum folate concentration from 168 blood donors was 22.7 nmol/L, of which 85.8% was 5mTHF, 12.1% hmTHF, 2.1% FA, and 0.0% 5fTHF. In the same individuals, the mean concentrations of pABG and apABG were 0.07 nmol/L and 0.47 nmol/L, respectively. The concentrations of folate catabolites were 22-30 times higher in 39 patients with renal failure. This folate assay correlated well with the microbiologic assay (r(2) = 0.92) and with measurement of serum folate as pABG equivalents (r(2) = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: This method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measures the most abundant folate species and 2 folate catabolites in human serum.",M1
19342442,"Controlled study on folate status following folic acid supplementation and discontinuation in women of child-bearing age.BACKGROUND: To decrease the incidence of neural tube defects, active efforts are currently undertaken to promote folic acid (<e>FA</e>) intake among women. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved the proposal of introducing an oral contraceptive (OC) and FA combination pill. It is unknown whether these pills will reduce neural tube defect incidence for couples who do not become pregnant soon after discontinuation. We studied FA kinetics up to 12 weeks discontinuation of eight weeks 500 microg/d FA in 27 healthy Dutch women of child-bearing age. METHODS: In this controlled study, women were assigned to an intervention group (n = 13) or a control group (n = 14). The total study duration was 20 weeks, during which the subjects had to give blood on nine occasions (week -8 [baseline], -4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12) for analyses of serum and erythrocyte folate, and plasma total homocysteine. The intervention group received 500 microg/d FA during the first eight weeks, and discontinued the intake from weeks 0 to 12. No supplements were supplied to the control group. RESULTS: Serum folate and plasma total homocysteine returned to baseline after 12 weeks of FA discontinuation, erythrocyte folate did not. CONCLUSION: An FA/OC combination pill seems to be of value for only a minor portion of women. Active efforts to stimulate women of child-bearing age to take FA remain essential.",M1
19282359,"Tumor cell targeting using folate-conjugated fluorescent quantum dots and receptor-mediated endocytosis.BACKGROUND: Luminescent nanobioprobes with cell-targeting specificity are likely to find important applications in bioanalysis, biomedicine, and clinical diagnosis. Quantum dots (QDs) are unique and promising materials for such a purpose because of their fluorescence and large surface area for attaching cell-targeting molecules. METHODS: We produced water-dispersible QDs by coating hydrophobic QDs with small amphiphilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules via hydrophobic interactions. We covalently coupled folate (<e>FA</e>) onto the water-dispersible PEG-coated QDs (PEG-QDs) to produce FA-coupled PEG-QDs (FA-PEG-QDs). RESULTS: These FA-PEG-QD nanoparticles functioned as fluorescent nanobioprobes that specifically recognized folate receptors (FRs) overexpressed in human nasopharyngeal cells (KB cells) but not in an FR-deficient lung carcinoma cell line (A549 cells). Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated uptake of FA-PEG-QDs by KB cells but no uptake of folate-free PEG-QDs. The specificity of this receptor-mediated internalization was confirmed by comparing the uptake by KB vs A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that such cell-targeting fluorescent nanobioprobes are potentially very powerful tools for recognizing target cells and delivering and tracking drugs and other therapeutic materials.",M1

19250665,"Folate-conjugated amphiphilic hyperbranched block copolymers based on Boltorn H40, poly(L-lactide) and poly(ethylene glycol) for tumor-targeted drug delivery.Folate-conjugated amphiphilic hyperbranched block copolymer (H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-<e>FA</e>) with a dendritic Boltorn H40 core, a hydrophobic poly(l-lactide) (PLA) inner shell and a hydrophilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) and folate-conjugated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-FA) outer shell was synthesized as a carrier for tumor-targeted drug delivery. The block copolymer was characterized using (1)H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Due to its core-shell structure, this block polymer forms unimolecular micelles in aqueous solutions. The micellar properties of H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-FA block copolymer were extensively studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An anticancer drug, doxorubicin in the free base form (DOX) was encapsulated into H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-FA micelles. The DOX-loaded micelles provided an initial burst release (up to 4h) followed by a sustained release of the entrapped DOX over a period of about 40 h. Cellular uptake of the DOX-loaded H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-FA micelles was found to be higher than that of the DOX-loaded H40-PLA-b-MPEG micelles because of the folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis, thereby providing higher cytotoxicity against the 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line. In vitro degradation studies revealed that the H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-FA block copolymer hydrolytically degraded into polymer fragments within six weeks. These results indicated that the micelles prepared from the H40-PLA-b-MPEG/PEG-FA block copolymer have great potential as tumor-targeted drug delivery nanocarriers.",M1

The intake of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) prior to conception and during the early stages of pregnancy plays an important role in preventing neural tube defects, severe anomalies of brain embryogenesis, and other malformations such as cardiac and urinary tract anomalies, oro-facial clefts and limb reduction defects. The Italian Network for Folic Acid Promotion, coordinated by the National Center on Rare Diseases of the Italian National Institute of Health, has elaborated and diffused a recommendation for the periconceptional FA supplementation:  Women of child-bearing age, are recommended to consume 0,4 mg/day of FA, to reduce the risk of congenital defects. The intake of folic acid should start at least one month before the conception and should continue for the first quarter of pregnancy . This paper discusses various strategies in order to promote FA intake during periconceptional period. Food fortification, adopted in several countries such as USA, has raised concerns about the risk of an excessive FA intake which may lead to adverse effect such as tumour promotion. Currently, periconceptional supplementation and healthy dietary habits promotion appear to be the most effective strategies.",M1
19219877,"Multimodal-luminescence core-shell nanocomposites for targeted imaging of tumor cells.Uniform silica-coated NaYF(4): 20 mol % Yb, 2 mol % Er nanocomposites with good dispersibility, containing organic dye incorporated in the silica shell and folic acid conjugated on the surface of the shell, were prepared and characterized. The core-shell nanocomposites are 20-22 nm in size, water soluble, and buffer stable, with good photostability and biocompatibility. Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) offers a means of targeting human cells that greatly overexpress the folate receptor (FR). By the use of confocal microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrate the receptor-mediated delivery of FA-conjugated nanocomposites targeting FR-positive cell lines, such as KB cells. The receptor-mediated targeting was confirmed by a comparison with the uptake of these nanocomposites in FR-negative cell lines, such as MCF-7. These results show that the silica-coated upconverting nanophosphor (UCNP) nanocomposites prepared by our strategy can potentially be useful as multimodal bioimaging agents.",M1
19201400,"Fluoxetine treatment for anxiety in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.OBJECTIVE: To compare anxiety levels experienced during 4 stressful periods of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and treatment outcomes between women taking fluoxetine and a placebo. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients allocated to receive either fluoxetine (FLX) or folic acid (<e>FA</e>). Anxiety state was assessed at the beginning of ovarian stimulation (OS), ovum pick-up, embryo transfer, and on the day of the pregnancy test (DPT) using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Baseline STAI-S and STAI-T were normal. From OS to DPT, STAI-S increased from 42.8+/-10.6 to 44+/-9.0 in the FLX group and from 40.9+/-8.1 to 45.3+/-8.3 in the FA group (P=0.03 and P=0.001, respectively). IVF outcome was not affected by the treatment in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Caution is needed in prescribing fluoxetine to alleviate anxiety in patients undergoing IVF. Studies are needed to determine whether other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or higher fluoxetine doses can relieve emotional distress without affecting IVF outcome.",M1
19166923,"9-NC-loaded folate-conjugated polymer micelles as tumor targeted drug delivery system: preparation and evaluation in vitro.In this study, folate-conjugated polymer micelles were synthesized by mixing folate-poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (<e>FA</e>-PEG-DSPE) and methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (MPEG-DSPE) to encapsulate anticancer agent 9-nitro-camptothecin (9-NC). Formulations were characterized by critical micellization concentration (CMC) values of copolymers, micelle particle size, zeta-potential, encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency. The molar ratio of FA-PEG-DSPE and MPEG-DSPE was chosen to avoid the macrophages and at the same time express highly active targeting ability. The targeting ability of folate-conjugated polymer micelles was investigated against three kinds of tumor cell lines (HeLa, SGC7901 and BXPC3). The drug efficacy in vitro of folate-conjugated polymer micelles was evaluated by using the methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) method. The results showed that the CMC values of MPEG-DSPE and FA-PEG-DSPE were 0.97 x 10(-5)M and 1.0 x 10(-5)M, respectively. The average size of folate-conjugated micelle was about 21-24 nm and the micelle size distribution of both empty and drug-loaded micelles were rather narrow. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency were 97.6% and 4.64%, respectively. The drug-loaded micelles were stable during storage at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks. Micelles maintain the similar size and did not show 9-NC leakage. The best molar ratio of FA-PEG-DSPE and MPEG-DSPE in folate-conjugated micelles was 1:100 which can effectively solubilize 9-NC, avoid the macrophages in vitro and has a higher anti-tumor activity than both drug-loaded MPEG-DSPE micelles and free anticancer agents. The folate-conjugated polymer micelle which can avoid the macrophages is a kind of promising carrier for poorly soluble anticancer agents via folate receptor (FR) that mediated endocytosis to target tumor cells.",M1
19162536,"Complexation of anthracene with folic acid studied by FTIR and UV spectroscopies.Toxicity and transformation process of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is strongly depended on the interaction between PAHs and the coexisting compounds. Complexation between folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and a typical PAH, anthracene, was investigated using FTIR and UV spectra. Appearance of a new IR band at 2362cm(-1) demonstrates that NH(2)-CN(1)- moiety on pterin (PT) ring in FA is protonated when anthracene is introduced. The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene. These experiments confirm that anthracene could combine with the pterin ring of folic acid through pi-pi donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) and induce the protonation process in FA upon strengthening electron accepting ability of PT ring.",M1
19145103,"Effect of cannabinoids upon the uptake of folic acid by BeWo cells.Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is an essential micronutrient that is particularly important during pregnancy for normal placental and fetal development and growth. The placenta and the fetus become frequently exposed to drugs of abuse such as cannabinoids because of maternal use of these substances. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of cannabinoids on the uptake of FA by BeWo cells. Acute treatment with anandamide (1-10 micromol/l) caused a 15% decrease in (3)H-FA uptake at pH 7.5. Moreover, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (1-10 micromol/l) caused a 30% increase, and AM630 (1 mumol/l) a 15% decrease in this parameter at pH 6.5. Neither the inhibitory effect of anandamide nor the stimulatory effect of THC were changed in the presence of cannabi- noid receptor type 1 or type 2 antagonists (AM251 and AM630, respectively). Chronic treatment (48 h) with THC (100 nmol/l) and AM251 (100 nmol/l) decreased the uptake of (3)H-FA by 20% at pH 7.5, and anandamide (1 micromol/l) and AM630 (10-500 nmol/l) increased it by 30%. Moreover, CP55,940 (10 nmol/l) increased the uptake of (3)H-FA by 30% at pH 6.5. RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of the reduced folate transporter 1 increased by 9% after chronic treatment with AM630 (500 nmol/l). The mRNA levels of the proton-coupled folate transporter decreased by 17% and increased by 18% after chronic treatment with THC (0.1 mumol/l) and AM251 (100 nmol/l), respectively. In conclusion, (3)H-FA uptake by BeWo cells is significantly, although not very markedly, changed by several distinct CB receptor agonists and antagonists, both after acute and chronic exposure of the cells. The acute effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists do not seem to be mediated by the cannabinoid receptor, and with a few exceptions the chronic effects do not seem to be related to changes in the expression levels of FA transporters.",M1
19121630,"Effects of folic acid deficiency and MTHFRC677T polymorphisms on cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.Apoptosis (APO) and necrosis (NEC) are two different types of cell death occurring in response to cellular stress factors. Cells with DNA damage may undergo APO or NEC. Folate is an essential micronutrient associated with DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) regulates intracellular folate metabolism. Folate deficiency and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms have been shown to be related to DNA damage. To verify the cytotoxic effects of folate deficiency on cells with different MTHFR C677T genotypes, 15 human peripheral lymphocyte cases with different MTHFR C677T genotypes were cultured in folic acid (<e>FA</e>)-deficient and -sufficient media for 9 days. Cytotoxicity was quantified using the frequencies of APO and NEC as endpoints, the nuclear division index (NDI), and the number of viable cells (NVC). These results showed that FA is an important factor in reducing cytotoxicity and increasing cell proliferation. Lymphocytes with the TT genotype proliferated easily under stress and exhibited different responses to FA deficiency than lymphocytes with the CC and CT genotypes. A TT individual may accumulate more cytotoxicity under cytotoxic stress, suggesting that the effects of FA deficiency on cytotoxicity are greater than the effects in individuals with the other MTHFR C677T variants.",M1
19116334,"Vitamin B-12 and neural tube defects: the Canadian experience.Although early epidemiologic studies showed a protective effect of adequate maternal folic acid (<e>FA</e>) status against neural tube defects (NTDs), the role of adequate vitamin B-12 nutrition in the putative reduction of NTD frequency has remained uncertain. Evaluating vitamin B-12 status was complicated by the need to control for altered FA status after fortification in Canada. More recent studies have made use of better biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status, including methylmalonic acid and holotranscobalamin (holoTC). HoloTC provides a useful measure of vitamin B-12 status because it represents the bioavailable fraction of circulating vitamin B-12. By assessing bioavailable vitamin B-12 status in a large Canadian cohort accrued before and after FA fortification, we found a 3-fold increase in the risk of NTDs in mothers who had vitamin B-12 status in the lower quartile, regardless of FA fortification. Our work suggests that vitamin B-12 fortification, analogous to the FA fortification program, may reduce NTDs more than FA fortification alone. A multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing periconceptional vitamin B-12 in combination with FA against FA alone is warranted.",M1
19114352,"[Synthesis and characterization of folic acid-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles as a tumor-targeted drug carrier]OBJECTIVE: To synthesize and characterize paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded folate-conjugated chitosan (<e>FA</e>-CTS/PTX) nanoparticles and evaluate its cytotoxicity in vitro. METHODS: CTS/PTX and FA-CTS/PTX nanoparticles were prepared using reductive amidation and ionic gelation of chitosan with tripolyphosphate anions (TPP). The particle size was determined by laser scattering and the morphology observed using transmission electron microscopy, and the PTX content in the nanoparticles was determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 227 nm. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles against HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the HeLa cells incubated with FA-chitosan nanoparticles in the presence or absence of folic acid in the culture medium. RESULTS: PTX loading did not cause adhesion of the FA-CTS nanoparticles, which presented with uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of 282.8 nm. The loading and encapsulation efficiencies of FA-CTS/PTX were 9.0% and 75.4%, respectively. The FA-CTS nanoparticles showed a greater extent of intracellular uptake in the absence of folic acid, indicating that the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles occurred through endocytosis mediated by the folate receptors. The PTX-loaded FA-CTS nanoparticles exhibited potent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells, an effect 2- to 3-fold stronger than that of PTX-loaded CTS nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: FA-CTS can be a promising drug carrier with high efficiency in condensing drug, good tumor-targeting ability and low cytotoxicity.",M1
19110071,"Methotrexate-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in germ cells of mice: intervention of folic and folinic acid.Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-metabolite widely used in the treatment of neoplastic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The basis for its therapeutic efficacy is the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the folic acid (<e>FA</e>) metabolism. FA is a water-soluble vitamin which is involved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, the essential precursors of DNA. Folinic acid (FNA) is the reduced form of FA that circumvents the inhibition of DHFR. Folate supplementation during MTX therapy for psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis reduces both toxicity and side effects without compromising the efficacy. Further, FNA supplementation reduces the common side effects of MTX in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. FA and FNA are reported to have protective effects on MTX-induced genotoxicity in the somatic cells; however their protective effects on the germ cells have not been much explored. Previously, we evaluated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of MTX in the germ cells of mice. In the present study, we have intervened FA and FNA for the protection of germ cell toxicity induced by MTX in male swiss mice. The animals were pre-treated with FA at the doses of 50, 100 and 200 microg/kg for 4 consecutive days per week and on day five; MTX was administered at the dose of 20mg/kg once. FNA was administered at the doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, 6 h (h) after single administration of MTX at the dose of 20 mg/kg. The dosing regimen was continued up to 10 weeks. The germ cell toxicity was evaluated using testes weight (wt), sperm count, sperm head morphology, sperm comet assay, histology, TUNEL and halo assay in testis. The results clearly demonstrate that prior administration of FA and post-treatment with FNA reduces the germ cell toxicity induced by MTX as evident from the decreased sperm head abnormalities, seminiferous tubule damage, sperm DNA damage, TUNEL positive cells and increased sperm counts. In the present study, we report that FA and FNA ameliorate the germ cell toxicity of MTX in mice.",M1
19105859,"Factors associated with a positive intake of folic acid in the periconceptional period among Korean women.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the factors associated with a positive intake of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) during the periconceptional period among Korean women. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study of demographic, obstetric and socio-economic data, history of periconceptional intake of FA and awareness of the benefits of FA supplementation in pregnancy were obtained and analysed using the chi2 test, followed by multiple logistic regression analysis. SETTING: The Maternity School, Cheil General Hospital and Women's Healthcare Center, Seoul, South Korea, between October 2005 and March 2006. SUBJECTS: In total 1313 pregnant women participating in a two-day training course available every month. RESULTS: After excluding subjects with incomplete or inconsistent data, there were 1277 women included in the analysis. Participants were aged 29.4 (sd 2.9) years and had a mean gestational age of 27.9 (sd 7.1) weeks. Only 131 (10.3 %) women took FA during the periconceptional period. According to multiple logistic regression analyses, the adjusted OR for FA supplementation was 1.79 (95 % CI 1.10, 2.91) in women who had previous spontaneous abortions, 4.10 (95 % CI 2.43, 6.78) in women who planned their pregnancy and 6.63 (95 % CI 2.08, 21.12) in those who were aware of the protective effects of FA. CONCLUSIONS: Periconceptional intake of FA was more likely among Korean women with a history of previous spontaneous abortion, who planned their pregnancy or who were aware of the protective effects of FA during pregnancy. However, the proportion of women who took FA in the periconceptional period was low.",M1
19098451,"Folic acid and sodium butyrate prevent tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colorectal cancer.Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its incidence has been increasing in recent years. The role of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, has only recently been investigated. In this study, the effects of epigenetic agents such as folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and sodium butyrate (NaBu) on the development of colorectal cancer induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) using ICR mice was examined. Of the mice treated in a chemopreventive manner with epigenetic agents, FA and NaBu, 15-50% developed colorectal cancer at 24 weeks compared with a 95% incidence of colorectal cancer in DMH-treated control mice. Folate deficiency can alter cytosine methylation in DNA leading to inappropriate activation of the proto-oncogene c-myc. We detected lower levels of p21(WAF1) gene expression in colorectal cancer samples, as well as significantly lower levels of acetylated histone H3, compared with samples from corresponding normal colorectal mucosa. In contrast, administration of NaBu increased levels of p21(WAF1) mRNA and p21(WAF1) protein, and was associated with an accumulation of histone acetylation. In summary, our results show that FA and NaBu reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer induced by DMH-induced in ICR mice, and therefore we hypothesize that targeting epigenetic targets should be further investigated for the prevention of colorectal cancer in humans.",M1
19084389,"Immunoassay for folic acid detection in vitamin-fortified milk based on electrochemical magneto sensors.An immunoassay-based strategy for folic acid in vitamin-fortified milk with electrochemical detection using magneto sensors is described for the first time. Among direct and indirect competitive formats, best performance was achieved with an indirect competitive immunoassay. The immunological reaction for folic acid (<e>FA</e>) detection was performed, for the first time on the magnetic bead as solid support by the covalent immobilization of a protein conjugate BSA-FA on tosyl-activated magnetic bead. Further competition for the specific antibody between FA in the food sample and FA immobilized on the magnetic bead was achieved, followed by the reaction with a secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (AntiIgG-HRP). Then, the modified magnetic beads were easily captured by a magneto sensor made of graphite-epoxy composite (m-GEC) which was also used as the transducer for the electrochemical detection. The performance of the immunoassay-based strategy with electrochemical detection using magneto sensors was successfully evaluated using spiked-milk samples and compared with a novel magneto-ELISA based on optical detection. The detection limit was found to be of the order of microgl(-1) (13.1 nmoll(-1), 5.8 microgl(-1)) for skimmed milk. Commercial vitamin-fortified milk samples were also evaluated obtaining good accuracy in the results. This novel strategy offers great promise for rapid, simple, cost-effective and on-site analysis of biological and food samples.",M1
18980119,"Simultaneous determination of a ternary mixture of doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and folic acid by the ratio spectra-zero-crossing, double divisor-ratio spectra derivative, and column high-performance liquid chromatographic methods.Three simple, rapid, and accurate methods, i.e., the derivative ratio spectra-zero-crossing method (method I), double divisor-ratio spectra derivative method (method II), and column reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method (method III) were developed for the simultaneous determination of doxylamine succinate (DOX), pyridoxine hydrochloride (PYR), and folic acid (<e>FA</e>) in their ternary mixtures and in tablets. In methods I and II, the calibration graphs were linear in the range of 2.5-80, 1.0-40, and 1.0-30 microg/mL for DOX, PYR, and FA, respectively. In the HPLC method, the separation of these compounds was performed using mobile phase consisting of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.3)-methanol-acetonitrile (50 + 20 + 30, v/v/v), and UV detection was performed at 263 nm. Linearity was observed between the concentrations of the analytes and peak areas [correlation coefficient (r) &gt; or =0.9998] in the concentration range of 1.0-200, 4.0-600, and 4.0-600 microg/mL for DOX, PYR, and FA, respectively. The standard deviation of retention time in method III was 0.011, 0.015, and 0.016 for DOX, PYR, and FA, respectively. The precision studies for all of the methods gave relative standard deviation values of &lt;2%. The results obtained from the methods were statistically compared by means of Student's t-test and the variance ratio F-test. It was concluded that all of the developed methods were equally accurate, sensitive, and precise. These methods could be applied to determine DOX, PYR, and FA in their combined dosage forms.",M1
18930464,"Investigation of folic acid stability in fortified instant noodles by use of capillary electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography.A single enzyme treatment with alpha-amylase, prior to the quantification of added folic acid (<e>FA</e>) in fortified instant fried Asian noodles with analysis performed by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV detection, is described. The method was validated and optimized for capillary electrophoresis (CE) with separation achieved using a 8 mM phosphate-12 mM borate run buffer with 5% MeOH at pH 9.5. FA was well separated from matrix components with nicotinic acid (NA) employed as an internal standard. In a comparative study, separation of FA was performed using HPLC with a mobile phase consisting of 27% MeOH (v/v) in aqueous potassium phosphate buffer (3.5 mM KH(2)PO(4) and 3.2 mM K(2)HPO(4)), pH 8.5, and containing 5 mM tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate as an ion-pairing agent. For both methods, excellent results were obtained for various analytical parameters including linearity, accuracy and precision. The limit of detection was calculated to be 2.2 mg/L for CE without sample stacking and 0.10 mg/L with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sample extraction involved homogenization and enzymatic extraction with alpha-amylase. Results indicated that FA was stable during four main stages of instant fried noodle manufacturing (dough crumbs, cut sheets, steaming and frying).",M1
18781038,"Folic acid prevents congenital malformations in the offspring of diabetic mice.It is well known that maternal diabetes causes various congenital malformations. Although there are many reports that folic acid (<e>FA</e>) administration in pregnancy reduces the risk of birth defects including neural tube defects (NTDs), a precise analysis on the preventive effect of FA against diabetic embryopathy has not been done yet. In this study, we analyzed the preventive effects of FA on congenital malformations including NTDs, cardiovascular, and skeletal malformations using a diabetic mouse model. Female mice were rendered hyperglycemic by streptozotocin and then mated. Pregnant diabetic mice were treated daily with FA (3 mg/kg body weight) or saline between gestational days (GD) 6 and 10. On GD 18, fetuses were examined for congenital malformations. FA did not affect plasma glucose levels. In the DM control group, the incidence of NTDs, cardiovascular, and skeletal malformations was 28.4%, 28.5%, and 29.7%, respectively. In the FA-treated group, the corresponding proportions reduced to 6.0%, 2.5% and 12.5%, respectively. A whole-mount TUNEL revealed an increased apoptosis in the hindbrain region of embryos from DM control group on day 9.5, and the apoptosis was decreased by FA treatment. Maternal plasma homocysteine levels on GD 9.5 were significantly lowered in DM control group compared with those in non-DM group, and FA treatment did not show a significant effect. These results indicate that FA is effective for the prevention of various diabetic embryopathy including NTDs, cardiovascular, and skeletal malformations, and suggested that this effect is independent from homocysteine metabolism and possibly mediated by decreasing the abnormal apoptosis during organogenesis.",M1
18778356,"The administration of folic acid improves erectile function and reduces intracavernosal oxidative stress in the diabetic rabbit.OBJECTIVE: To test the possibility that folic acid (<e>FA</e>) may be a means of treating erectile dysfunction (ED) in diabetes mellitus (DM), by studying the effect of FA administration to DM rabbits on cavernosal function and intrapenile oxidative stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the effect of administering FA to DM rabbits on erectile function and oxidative stress the formation of superoxide (O(2)(-)), 8-isoprostane F(2 alpha) (8-IPF(2 alpha)) and prostacyclin (as 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)) were assessed, as well as carbachol- and electrical field stimulated (EFS) relaxation and p47(phox) content (active component of NADPH oxidase complex). Non-ketotic DM was induced in New Zealand rabbits with alloxan and FA administered orally daily for 1 month. Rabbits were killed, penises excised and segments prepared. These were mounted in an organ bath and relaxation elicited with carbachol or EFS. O(2)(-) release was measured spectrophotometrically, p47(phox) expression by Western blotting and 8-IPF(2 alpha) and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) formation by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Blood was collected for measurement of homocysteine, red blood cell (RBC) folate and glucose. RESULTS: In cavernosal tissue from DM rabbits, carbachol-and EFS-induced relaxation was significantly impaired compared with the untreated controls. O(2)(-) release, p47(phox) expression and 8-IPF(2 alpha) formation were all enhanced and 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) formation reduced compared with the controls. All these effects were reversed by FA. Plasma total homocysteine was reduced and RBC folate elevated. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of FA may constitute a strategy for reducing ED in patients with DM.",M1
18762276,"The interactive effect of alcohol and folic acid on genome stability in human WIL2-NS cells measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay.Chromosomal mutations are commonly found in cancer cells, and can be caused by several factors including dietary insufficiency and exposure to environmental and life-style genotoxins. Folate (vitamin B9), one of the essential micronutrients, is required for DNA repair and synthesis and to maintain genome stability. Since excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption may alter folate status and low folate might alter susceptibility to alcohol toxicity, a study was performed to investigate the individual and interactive impacts of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and ethanol on genome stability in vitro. The experiments were performed using WIL2-NS cells cross-tested at three FA (20, 200 and 2000 nM) and four ethanol concentrations (0, 0.09, 0.36 and 1.34%, v/v) over a two-week culture time. Chromosomal damage and cytotoxicity were measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay. The present study showed dose-related genotoxic effects of both decreasing folic acid concentration and increased ethanol on day 15 resulting in significant induction of micronuclei, nuclear buds and nucleoplasmic bridges which are biomarkers of chromosome breakage or loss, gene amplification and chromosomal rearrangement, respectively. Increased ethanol and FA deficiency interacted to further significantly increase micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges. However there was no evidence showing alcohol's ability to cleave FA. The findings from this study suggest a protective effect of FA against alcohol-induced DNA damage and that FA deficiency in the physiological range has a stronger impact on genome stability than exposure to cytotoxic doses of ethanol achievable in binge drinking.",M1
18717517,"Preventive role of folic acid on the developmental toxicity of phenol in Drosophila melanogaster.Phenol (PN), obtained from coal tar, is used commonly in medical treatments, industrial areas, petroleum refineries, production of glue, fiber, and nylon. PN is used in the production of benzene and it is emitted in the atmosphere by motor vehicles. Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is an essential nutrient among the B complex group of vitamins. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PN and PN + FA on various developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster. Different concentrations of PN and PN + FA were administered during the developmental periods of the fly (egg, larva and pupa). When F1 progeny of control and experimental groups were compared, PN was found to extend the process of metamorphosis and decrease the total offspring numbers. However, these negative effects were inhibited by FA treatment at different concentrations (0.25-2.50 mg/kg). These results suggest that FA could effectively inhibit PN-induced abnormalities in developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster.",M1
18668503,"Folate-equipped pegylated archaeal lipid derivatives: synthesis and transfection properties.We have previously shown that synthetic archaeal lipid analogues are useful vectors for drug/gene delivery. We report herein the synthesis and gene transfer properties of a series of novel di- and tetraether-type archaeal derivatives with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain and further equipped with a folic acid (<e>FA</e>) group. The synthetic strategy and the purification by dialysis ensured complete removal of free FA. The lipids were mixed with a conventional glycine betaine-based cationic lipid and the resulting formulations were tested in transfection assays after complexation with plasmid DNA. All four novel co-lipids afforded efficient in vitro gene transfection. Moreover, the FA-equipped derivatives permitted ligand/receptor-based targeted transfection; their activity was inhibited when free FA was added to the transfection medium. These novel archaeal derivatives equipped with FA-PEG moieties may thus be of great interest for targeted in vivo transfection.",M1
18661990,"Targeted single-wall carbon nanotube-mediated Pt(IV) prodrug delivery using folate as a homing device.Most low-molecular-weight platinum anticancer drugs have short blood circulation times that are reflected in their reduced tumor uptake and intracellular DNA binding. A platinum(IV) complex of the formula c, c, t-[Pt(NH 3) 2Cl 2(O 2CCH 2CH 2CO 2H)(O 2CCH 2CH 2CONH-PEG-<e>FA</e>)] ( 1), containing a folate derivative (FA) at an axial position, was prepared and characterized. Folic acid offers a means of targeting human cells that highly overexpress the folate receptor (FR). Compound 1 was attached to the surface of an amine-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT-PL-PEG-NH 2) through multiple amide linkages to use the SWNTs as a  longboat delivery system  for the platinum warhead, carrying it to the tumor cell and releasing cisplatin upon intracellular reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). The ability of SWNT tethered 1 to destroy selectively FR(+) vs FR(-) cells demonstrated its ability to target tumor cells that overexpress the FR on their surface. That the SWNTs deliver the folate-bearing Pt(IV) cargos into FR(+) cancer cells by endocytosis was demonstrated by the localization of fluorophore-labeled SWNTs using fluorescence microscopy. Once inside the cell, cisplatin, formed upon reductive release from the longboat oars, enters the nucleus and reacts with its target nuclear DNA, as determined by platinum atomic absorption spectroscopy of cell extracts. Formation of the major cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-links on the nuclear DNA was demonstrated by use of a monoclonal antibody specific for this adduct. The SWNT-tethered compound 1 is the first construct in which both the targeting and delivery moieties have been incorporated into the same molecule; it is also the first demonstration that intracellular reduction of a Pt(IV) prodrug leads to the cis-{Pt((NH 3) 2} 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link in nuclear DNA.",M1
18656328,"Efficacy of folic acid and enalapril combined therapy on reduction of blood pressure and plasma glucose: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) plus enalapril with enalapril alone on the reduction of blood pressure (BP) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in adult Chinese hypertensive patients. METHODS: Four hundred eighty subjects with mild to moderate BP were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: 1) 10 mg of enalapril (control group), 2) 10 mg of enalapril plus 0.4 mg of FA (low-FA group), or 3) 10 mg of enalapril plus 0.8 mg of FA (high-FA group) daily for 8 wk. Generalized linear mixed models were used to compare the reduction in BP and FPG level from baseline to week 8 of the treatment and the difference among the three treatment groups, adjusting for pertinent covariates. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-three subjects (57.3% women, 27-75 y of age) successfully completed the trial. After the 8-wk treatment, compared with baseline, all treatment groups showed significant reduction of BP but not of FPG. There was no significant difference in BP or FPG reduction among the three treatment groups. In subgroup analysis, we found that in subjects with hyperglycemia (FPG &gt;or=6.1 mmol/L) at baseline, FPG reduction was significantly greater in the high-FA group (-0.80 +/- 1.20 mmol/L) than in the low-FA group (-0.39 +/- 1.44 mmol/L) and the control group (-0.23 +/- 1.30 mmol/L). Regression analysis further confirmed that FPG reduction in the high-FA group was -0.68 +/- 0.28 mmol/L greater than in the control group (P = 0.015), even after adjustment for important covariates. A dose-response trend was evident (P for trend = 0.025) and the test for an interaction between treatment group and baseline FPG was significant (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this sample of adult Chinese hypertensive patients, FA combined with enalapril showed a greater beneficial effect on reduction of FPG in a dose-related fashion than did enalapril alone among subjects with hyperglycemia.",M1
18651631,"Targeting the folate receptor (FR): imaging and cytotoxicity of ReI conjugates in FR-overexpressing cancer cells.The synthesis, characterization, in vitro imaging, and cytotoxic properties of a new folate conjugate of rhenium(I) are reported. The conjugate [<e>FA</e>-PEG-BQAV-Re(CO)3]+ (gamma-4) was screened against an adriamycin- and cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line (A2780/AD) that overexpresses the folate receptor (FR). Compound gamma-4 was internalized by a folate-receptor-mediated endocytotic pathway, which results in internal accumulation of gamma-4. This was contrasted with a FR-negative Chinese hamster ovary cell line in which no internalization of gamma-4 was observed. gamma-4 was found to be cytotoxic with IC(50) values of 189 and 78 microM at 6 and 24 h, respectively, toward the FR-positive cell line. This is in contrast to the IC(50) value of 502 microM at 6 h and 84 microM at 24 h for cisplatin in the same cell line, with a significantly greater toxicity at the earlier time point. The cytotoxicity of gamma-4 as explained by interactions that occur between the rhenium(I) complex moiety and DNA is described.",M1
18641196,"Weekly may be as efficacious as daily folic acid supplementation in improving folate status and lowering serum homocysteine concentrations in Guatemalan women.Daily folic acid (<e>FA</e>) supplementation improves folate status, lowers circulating homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, and reduces the risk of neural tube defects. Little is known about the efficacy of weekly FA supplementation. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of weekly and daily FA supplementations in improving folate and vitamin B-12 status and lowering Hcy concentrations in healthy reproductive-aged women. A randomized, double-blind supplementation trial was conducted in Guatemala. A total of 459 women were assigned randomly to 4 groups to receive weekly (5000 or 2800 microg) or daily (400 or 200 microg) FA for 12 wk. Daily and weekly iron, zinc, and vitamin B-12 were also provided. We determined serum and RBC folate by microbiological assays, but the latter was available only at baseline. Serum Hcy and vitamin B-12 were also measured. We used generalized linear regression models to assess the effects of treatment on biochemical indicators. Supplementation improved folate status similarly across all 4 groups. Overall, mean serum folate concentrations increased by 15.4 nmol/L (95% CI: 13.8, 16.9) and the geometric mean serum Hcy concentration decreased by 9.8% (95% CI: -12.3, -7.1). Daily supplementation improved serum vitamin B-12 by 20% (95% CI: 8, 33.2), whereas weekly supplementation had no effect. In conclusion, weekly FA (either high or low dose) plus vitamin B-12 may be as efficacious as daily supplementation in improving serum folate and lowering Hcy concentrations in healthy women of reproductive age.",M1
18623116,"Folate deprivation induces BCRP (ABCG2) expression and mitoxantrone resistance in Caco-2 cells.Folates can induce the expression and activity of the breast-cancer-resistance-protein (BCRP) and the multidrug-resistance-protein-1 (MRP1). Our aim was to study the time-dependent effect of folate deprivation/supplementation on (i) BCRP and MRP expression and (ii) on drug resistance mediated by these transporters. Therefore Caco-2 colon cancer cells usually grown in standard RPMI-medium containing supraphysiological folic acid (<e>FA</e>) concentrations (2.3 muM; high-folate, HF) were gradually adapted to more physiological folate concentrations (1 nM leucovorin (LV) or 1 nM FA; low-folate, LF), resulting in the sublines Caco-2-LF/LV and Caco-2-LF/FA. Caco-2-LF/LV and LF/FA cells exhibited a maximal increase of 5.2- and 9.6-fold for BCRP-mRNA and 3.9- and 5.7-fold for BCRP protein expression, respectively, but no major changes on MRP expression. Overexpression of BCRP in the LF-cells resulted in 3.6- to 6.3-fold resistance to mitoxantrone (MR), which was completely reverted by the BCRP inhibitor Ko143. On the other hand, LF-adapted cells were markedly more sensitive to methotrexate than the HF-counterpart, both after 4-hr (9,870- and 23,923-fold for Caco-2-LF/LV and LF/FA, respectively) and 72-hr (11- and 22-fold for Caco-2-LF/LV and LF/FA, respectively) exposure. Immunofluorescent staining observed with a confocal-laser-scan-microscope revealed that in Caco-2 cells (both HF and LF), BCRP is mainly located in the cytoplasm. In conclusion, folate deprivation induces BCRP expression associated with MR resistance in Caco-2 cells. The intracellular localization of BCRP in these cells suggests that this transporter is not primarily extruding its substrates out of the cell, but rather to an intracellular compartment where folates can be kept as storage.",M1
18586075,"Reversal activity of nanostructured lipid carriers loading cytotoxic drug in multi-drug resistant cancer cells.To overcome multi-drug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells, paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) were prepared by solvent diffusion method using monostearin as solid lipid and oleic acid as liquid lipid matrix. The cytotoxicities and reversal activity of drug-loaded NLC were tested against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells, human ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cells and their multi-drug resistant (MCF-7/ADR and SKOV3-TR30) cells. The chemical conjugant of folic acid and stearic acid (<e>FA</e>-SA) was further synthesized to prepare folated NLC. Comparing with taxol and doxorubicin solution, the NLC loading PTX exhibited high cytotoxicities in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells, while the NLC loading DOX only indicated high cytotoxicity in MCF-7/ADR cells. The reversal powers of the NLC loading PTX and DOX were 34.3 and 6.4 folds, respectively. The NLC loading PTX and DOX showed the same trends of enhanced cytotoxicity against SKOV3 and SKOV3-TR30 cells. The reversal powers were 31.3 and 2.2 folds for the NLC loading PTX and DOX, respectively. The modification of NLC with FA-SA could further enhance the cytotoxicities of drug in drug sensitive and drug resistant cells.",M1
18570689,"Laying hens can convert high doses of folic acid added to the feed into natural folates in eggs providing a novel source of food folate.There are few good sources of natural food folates apart from green leafy vegetables and these may have a limited potential to increase folate status because of substantial losses that can occur during cooking. Fortified foods can overcome this but are controversial because of safety concerns regarding chronic exposure to high-dose folic acid (<e>FA</e>; the synthetic form). The aim of the present study was to develop eggs with an enriched natural folate content and minimal unmetabolised FA. Forty-eight, 30-week-old laying hens were randomised to receive the basal feed (formulated to provide 1 mg folate/kg feed) to which had been added one of the following FA levels (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mg/kg feed). Total folate was measured in eggs collected throughout the 12-week study period and the FA content estimated at 12 weeks. Results showed that the maximal egg folate content was achieved by adding 16 mg FA/kg feed. At this optimal dose, the total folate content per egg was 75 microg (compared with 32 microg in a regular egg) of which FA represented at most 10%, a level which would probably be converted into natural folates by humans after ingestion. The results demonstrate that it is possible to use synthetic FA at high doses to produce novel animal foods enriched with natural folates in a cost-efficient process. Such foods may be particularly relevant to European populations without access to FA fortification and therefore dependent on natural food folate sources for the primary prevention of folate-related disease.",M1
18541378,"Folic acid supplementation affects apoptosis and differentiation of embryonic neural stem cells exposed to high glucose.Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) supplementation has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs), one of the most common birth defects associated with diabetic pregnancy. However, the antiteratogenic mechanism of FA in diabetes-induced NTDs is unclear. This study investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of FA in neural stem cells (NSCs) exposed to high glucose in vitro. The undifferentiated or differentiated NSCs were cultured in normal D-glucose concentration (NG) or high D-glucose concentration (HG) with or without FA. FA supplementation significantly decreased apoptosis induced by HG and lowered the expression of p53 in the nucleus of undifferentiated NSCs exposed to HG. Administration of FA in differentiated NSCs did not alter their precocious differentiation induced by HG. The increased mRNA expression levels of the basic helix-loop-helix factors including Neurog1, Neurog2, NeuroD2, Mash1, Id1, Id2, and Hes5 in the presence of HG were not significantly affected by FA. The present results provided a cellular mechanism by which FA supplementation may have a potential role in prevention of NTDs in diabetic pregnancies. On the other hand, FA increased the mRNA expression levels of the above transcription factors and accelerated the differentiation of NSCs in the NG medium, suggesting that it may adversely affect the normal differentiation of NSCs. Therefore, the timing and dose of FA would be critical factors in considering FA supplementation in normal maternal pregnancy.",M1

This modified electrode exhibited potent and persistent electron mediating behavior followed by well-separated oxidation peaks towards EP, UA and FA with activation overpotential. For the ternary mixture containing EP, UA and FA the three compounds can be well separated from each other at the scan rate of 20 mV s(-1). The obtained catalytic peak current, was linearly dependent on the EP, UA and FA concentrations in the range of 0.7-1200 microM, 25-750 microM and 15-800 microM and the detection limits for EP, UA and FA were 0.216+/-0.004, 8.8+/-0.2 and 11.0+/-0.3 microM, respectively. The diffusion coefficient (D), and the kinetic parameters such as electron transfer coefficient, (alpha) and heterogeneous rate constant, (k') for EP were also determined using electrochemical approaches. The modified electrode showed good sensitivity, selectivity and stability, and was employed for the determination of EP, UA and FA in the real samples.",M1
18436268,"Folic acid protects motor neurons against the increased homocysteine, inflammation and apoptosis in SOD1 G93A transgenic mice.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons. Mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) account for 20% cases of familial ALS (fALS), but the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are largely unknown. Using SOD1(G93A) mice model of ALS, we demonstrated that mutation in SOD1 caused a significant increase in the level of plasma homocysteine (Hcy). To investigate whether Hcy-lowering therapy is beneficial to this disease, we applied folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and vitamin B12 which are important factors involved in the Hcy metabolism to assess the neuroprotective effect of FA and B12 in the SOD1(G93A) mice. Our results showed FA or FA+B12 treatment significantly delayed the disease onset and prolonged the lifespan, accompanied by the significant reduction of motor neuron loss. Furthermore, we found that FA or FA+B12 treatment significantly attenuated the plasma Hcy level, suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in spinal cord. Moreover, FA or FA+B12 treatment decreased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) but up-regulated the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. However, B12 treatment alone did not show any significant benefit to this disease. These results provide evidence to demonstrate that elevated Hcy is involved in the pathogenesis of fALS and FA therapy may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of the disease.",M1

The diblock copolymer used in this study comprised a hydrophilic poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine] (MPC) block, carrying at the chain end the folate targeting moiety, and a pH-sensitive hydrophobic poly[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (DPA) block (<e>FA</e>-MPC-DPA). The drug-loading capacities of tamoxifen- and paclitaxel-loaded micelles were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and the micelle dimensions were determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Cell viability studies were carried out on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia (K-562) and colon carcinoma cell lines (Caco-2) in order to demonstrate that drug-loaded FA-MPC-DPA micelles exhibited higher cytotoxicities toward cancer cells than unfunctionalized MPC-DPA micelles.

18375715,"Mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for folic acid in cardiovascular disease.Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is a member of the B-vitamin family with cardiovascular roles in homocysteine regulation and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Its interaction with eNOS is thought to be due to the enhancement of tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability, helping maintain eNOS in its coupled state to favor the generation of nitric oxide rather than oxygen free radicals. FA also plays a role in the prevention of several cardiac and noncardiac malformations, has potent direct antioxidant and antithrombotic effects, and can interfere with the production of the endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor. These multiple mechanisms of action have led to studies regarding the therapeutic potential of FA in cardiovascular disease. To date, studies have demonstrated that FA ameliorates endothelial dysfunction and nitrate tolerance and can improve pathological features of atherosclerosis. These effects appear to be homocysteine independent but rather related to their role in eNOS function. Given the growing evidence that nitric oxide synthase uncoupling plays a major role in many cardiovascular disorders, the potential of exogenous FA as an inexpensive and safe oral therapy is intriguing and is stimulating ongoing investigations.",M1
18374705,"Effects of interaction of folic acid with uranium (VI) and basic triphenylmethane dyes on resonance Rayleigh scattering spectra and their analytical applications.In pH 4.2-4.8 HAc-NaAc buffer solution, folic acid (<e>FA</e>) could react with uranium (VI) to form a 2:1 anionic chelate which further reacted with some basic triphenylmethane dyes (BTPMD) such as Ethyl Violet (EV), Methyl Violet (MV) and Crystal Violet (CV) to form 1:2 ion-association complexes. As a result, not only the absorption spectra were changed, but also the intensities of resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) were enhanced greatly and the new RRS spectra were observed. The maximum RRS wavelengths were located at 328 nm for EV system, 325 nm for MV system and 328 nm for CV system. The fading degree (DeltaA) and RRS intensities (DeltaI) of three systems were different. Under given conditions, the DeltaA and DeltaI were all directly proportional to the concentration of FA. The linear ranges and the detection limits of RRS methods were 0.0039-5.0 microg mL(-1) and 1.2 ng mL(-1) for EV system, 0.0073-4.0 microg mL(-1) and 2.2 ng mL(-1) for MV system, 0.014-3.5 microg mL(-1) and 4.7 ng mL(-1) for CV system. The RRS methods exhibited higher sensitivity, so they are more suitable for the determination of trace FA. The optimum conditions, the influencing factors and the effects of coexisting substances on the reaction were investigated. The method can be applied to the determination of FA in serum and urine samples with satisfactory results. The structure of the ternary ion-association complex and the reaction mechanism were discussed in this work.",M1
18362233,"High-dose folic acid pretreatment blunts cardiac dysfunction during ischemia coupled to maintenance of high-energy phosphates and reduces postreperfusion injury.BACKGROUND: The B vitamin folic acid (<e>FA</e>) is important to mitochondrial protein and nucleic acid synthesis, is an antioxidant, and enhances nitric oxide synthase activity. Here, we tested whether FA reduces myocardial ischemic dysfunction and postreperfusion injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats were pretreated with either FA (10 mg/d) or placebo for 1 week and then underwent in vivo transient left coronary artery occlusion for 30 minutes with or without 90 minutes of reperfusion (total n=131; subgroups used for various analyses). FA (4.5x10(-6) mol/L i.c.) pretreatment and global ischemia/reperfusion (30 minutes/30 minutes) also were performed in vitro (n=28). After 30 minutes of ischemia, global function declined more in controls than in FA-pretreated rats (Delta dP/dtmax, -878+/-586 versus -1956+/-351 mm Hg/s placebo; P=0.03), and regional thickening was better preserved (37.3+/-5.3% versus 5.1+/-0.6% placebo; P=0.004). Anterior wall perfusion fell similarly (-78.4+/-9.3% versus -71.2+/-13.8% placebo at 30 minutes), yet myocardial high-energy phosphates ATP and ADP reduced by ischemia in controls were better preserved by FA pretreatment (ATP: control, 2740+/-58 nmol/g; ischemia, 947+/-55 nmol/g; ischemia plus FA, 1332+/-101 nmol/g; P=0.02). Basal oxypurines (xanthine, hypoxanthine, and urate) rose with FA pretreatment but increased less during ischemia than in controls. Ischemic superoxide generation declined (3124+/-280 cpm/mg FA versus 5898+/-474 cpm/mg placebo; P=0.001). After reperfusion, FA-treated hearts had smaller infarcts (3.8+/-1.2% versus 60.3+/-4.1% placebo area at risk; P&lt;0.002) and less contraction band necrosis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling positivity, superoxide, and nitric oxide synthase uncoupling. Infarct size declined similarly with 1 mg/d FA. CONCLUSIONS: FA pretreatment blunts myocardial dysfunction during ischemia and ameliorates postreperfusion injury. This is coupled to preservation of high-energy phosphates, reducing subsequent reactive oxygen species generation, eNOS-uncoupling, and postreperfusion cell death.",M1
18308888,"Walking or vitamin B for cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment? A randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of aerobic exercise or vitamin B supplementation on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 70-80 with MCI. Interventions : The 152 participants were randomly assigned to two INTERVENTIONS: (1) a twice-weekly, group-based, moderate-intensity walking programme (WP, n = 77) or a low-intensity placebo activity programme (n = 75) for one year; and (2) daily vitamin pill containing 5 mg folic acid, 0.4 mg vitamin B-12, 50 mg vitamin B-6 (<e>FA</e>/B12/B6, n = 78) or placebo pill (n = 74) for one year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive function, measured with neuropsychological tests at baseline and after six and 12 months. RESULTS: Median session attendance at the exercise programmes (25th-75th percentile) was 63% (2%-81%) and median compliance with taking pills (25th-75th percentile) was 100% (99%-100%). Gender was an effect modifier. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no main intervention effect for either intervention. In women in the WP, attention (Stroop combination task) improved by 0.3 seconds (p = 0.04) and memory (auditory verbal learning test) by 0.04 words (p = 0.06) with each percentage increase in session attendance. In men attending at least 75% of the sessions, the WP improved memory (beta 1.5 (95% CI: 0.1 to 3.0) words). CONCLUSION: The walking programme and/or FA/B12/B6 supplementation were not effective in improving cognition within one year. The walking programme, however, was efficacious in improving memory in men and memory and attention in women with better adherence.

18289475,"[Neuroprotective effects of topiramate and folic acid on young rats with kindling-induced epilepsy]OBJECTIVE: To study the neuroprotective effects of topiramate (TPM) alone or together with folic acid (<e>FA</e>) on young rats with kindling-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Rat models of epilepsy were prepared by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling. Seventy-two 3-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: four TPM-treated epilepsy groups (TPM 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg/d and TPM 40 mg/kg/d + FA 5 mg/kg/d), a positive control group (untreated epilepsy group) and a negative control group (normal control group). After two months of administration, behaviors of the rats were recorded; serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured using ELISA; pathological changes in the hippocampus were observed. RESULTS: The frequency of convulsion seizures in the 20, 40 and 80 mg TPM treatment and TPM+FA groups was 44.7 +/- 2.9, 44.3 +/- 3.1, 42.7 +/- 3.2, and 40.8 +/- 3.7 respectively, which were significantly lower than that in the positive control group (48.4 +/- 3.7) (P &lt;0.01). Twenty, forty and eighty mg TPM treatment and TPM+FA treatment significantly reduced NSE levels from 35.71 +/- 5.97 microg/L of the control group to 27.40+/- 6.40, 24.79 +/- 6.22, 21.47 +/- 6.87 and 22.55 +/- 7.02 microg/L respectively (P &lt;0.05). Neuronal apoptosis in the CA3 and CA1 regions were alleviated in the four TPM treatment groups compared with positive control. The number of necrotic neurons was progressively reduced with the increased dose of TPM. The 40 mg TPM+FA treatment group showed less necrotic neurons in the CA3 and CA1 regions than the 40 mg TPM alone treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: TPM has protective effects against epilepsy-induced neuronal damage. The effect is dose-dependent. A combination of TPM and FA can produce a synergistic effect.",M1
18259776,"Effect of folate derivatives on the activity of antifolate drugs used against malaria and cancer.The folate derivatives folic acid (<e>FA</e>) and folinic acid (FNA) decrease the in vivo and in vitro activities of antifolate drugs in Plasmodium falciparum. However, the effects of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF), the two dominant circulating folate forms in humans, have not been explored yet. We have investigated the effects of FA, FNA, 5-Me-THF, and THF on the in vitro activity of the antimalarial antifolates pyrimethamine and chlorcycloguanil and the anticancer antifolates methotrexate (MTX), aminopterin, and trimetrexate (TMX), against P. falciparum. The results indicate that these anticancers are potent against P. falciparum, with IC50 &lt; 50 nM. 5-Me-THF does not significantly decrease the activity of all tested drugs, and none of the tested folate derivatives significantly decrease the activity of these anticancers. Thus, malaria folate metabolism has features different from those in human, and the exploitation of this difference could lead to the discovery of new drugs to treat malaria. For instance, the combination of 5-Me-THF with a low dose of TMX could be used to treat malaria. In addition, the safety of a low dose of MTX in the treatment of arthritis indicates that this drug could be used alone to treat malaria.",M1
18216662,"Periconceptional folic acid use and the prevalence of positional plagiocephaly.The incidence of positional plagiocephaly (PP) has increased during the last 2 decades in the Netherlands. Although this is generally solely attributed to the advice to put babies on the back during their sleep, other factors might be of influence. Because the advice to take folic acid (<e>FA</e>) was initiated in the same period as the sleeping advice, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of FA on PP. It is known that a daily intake of 400 microg of FA around the time of conception is advised in periconceptive women to prevent development of neural tube defects. The maximal daily dietary folate intake is considered to be 250 mg with a bioavailability of 50% to 70%. However, periconceptional women may take a multivitamin containing pteroylmonoglutamine in addition to a FA supplement (isolated pteroylmonoglutamine). Therefore, the daily intake of FA will exceed 1 mg daily, which is considered the upper limit of daily folate ingestion. Data from the  Maastricht Cohort and Intervention study about pregnancy related girdlepain  were used to study the amount of folate containing supplemental intake of all the 7526 women. In this study, women were prospectively questioned about their FA intake. The entire cohort, considered the control group, was compared with a subgroup of women within this cohort with children with PP, treated by a plastic surgeon, considered the PP group. Double use, defined as isolated FA preparations in addition to folate containing supplements (vitamins), was seen more frequently in women giving birth to children with PP. In the PP group, double use was seen in 33.3% of the women compared to 13.2% in the control group. Although no statistical analysis could be made because the PP group was too small, the use of too high dosages of FA might have an adverse effect in causing more PP. This article does not want to discuss the beneficial effect of FA during pregnancy. However, we observed a potential empirical relation between PP and FA double intake requiring attention in more extensive studies.",M1
18201560,"Synthesis and characterization of folate-PEG-grafted-hyperbranched-PEI for tumor-targeted gene delivery.A great challenge for gene therapy is to develop a high efficient gene delivery system with low toxicity. Nonviral vectors are still attractive although the current agents displayed some disadvantages (i.e., low transfection efficiency, high toxicity). To overcome the high toxicity of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and low transfection efficiency of PEGylated PEI (PEG-PEI), we linked a cell specific target molecule folate (<e>FA</e>) on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and then grafted the FA-PEG onto hyperbranched PEI 25kDa. The FA-PEG- grafted-hyperbranched-PEI (FA-PEG-PEI) effectively condensed plasmid DNA (pDNA) into nanoparticles with positive surface charge under a suitable N/P ratio. Tested in deferent cell lines (i.e., HEK 293T, glioma C6 and hepatoma HepG2 cells), no significant cytotoxicity of FA-PEG-PEI was added to PEG-PEI. More importantly, significant transfection efficiency was exhibited in FA-targeted cells. Reporter assay showed that FA-PEG-PEI/pDNA complexes had significantly higher transgene activity than that of PEI/pDNA in folate-receptor (FR) positive (HEK 293T and C6) cells but not FR-negative (HepG2) cells. These results indicated that FA-PEG-PEI might be a promising candidate for gene delivery with the characteristics of good biocompatibility, potential biodegradability, and relatively high gene transfection efficiency.",M1
18176110,"Preclinical antitumor efficacy evaluation of dendrimer-based methotrexate conjugates.Our previous studies have demonstrated the in-vitro and in-vivo targeting of a generation-5 (G5) dendrimer-based multifunctional conjugate, which used folic acid (<e>FA</e>) as the targeting agent and methotrexate (MTX) as the chemotherapeutic drug. For the synthesized G5-FA-MTX nanodevice conjugate to be clinically applicable as a cancer therapeutic drug, it is important that the compound elicits cytotoxicity specifically and consistently. The aim of this work was to evaluate four independently synthesized batches of G5-FA-MTX conjugates for their cytotoxic potential and specificity. For determination of specificity, we have used a unique 'coculture' assay in which FA receptor-positive and FA receptor-negative cells were cultured together and have examined the preferential killing of the former. The results of our study show the batch-to-batch consistency and specificity of the G5-FA-MTX nanodevice in the preferential killing of FA receptor-positive cells. The coculture assay shows the consistency of the four different G5-FA-MTX conjugate lots in the specific killing of targeted cells. Further in-vivo studies are, however, necessary to prove the clinical potential of this targeted therapeutic nanodevice.",M1
18164602,"Minimalism in fabrication of self-organized nanogels holding both anti-cancer drug and targeting moiety.Recent researches to develop nano-carrier systems in anti-cancer drug delivery have focused on more complicated design to improve therapeutic efficacy and to reduce side effects. Although such efforts have great impact to biomedical science and engineering, the complexity has been a huddle because of clinical and economic problems. In order to overcome the problems, a simplest strategy to fabricate nano-carriers to deliver doxorubicin (DOX) was proposed in the present study. Two significant subjects (i) formation of nanoparticles loading and releasing DOX and (ii) binding specificity of them to cells, were examined. Folic acid (<e>FA</e>) was directly coupled with pullulan (Pul) backbone by ester linkage (FA/Pul conjugate) and the degree of substitution (DS) was varied, which were confirmed by 1H NMR and UV spectrophotometry. Light scattering results revealed that the nanogels possessed two major size distributions around 70 and 270 nm in an aqueous solution. Their critical aggregation concentrations (CACs) were less than 10 microg/mL, which are lower than general critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) of low-molecular-weight surfactants. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed well-dispersed nanogel morphology in a dried state. Depending on the DS, the nanogels showed different DOX-loading and releasing profiles. The DOX release rate from FA8/Pul (with the highest DS) for 24h was slower than that from FA4/or FA6/Pul, indicating that the FA worked as a hydrophobic moiety for drug holding. Cellular uptake of the nanogels (KB cells) was also monitored by confocal microscopy. All nanogels were internalized regardless of the DS of FA. Based on the results, the objectives of this study, to suggest a new method overcoming the complications in the drug carrier design, were successfully verified.",M1
18163165,"The effect of folic acid supplementation on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral methotrexate during the remission-induction period of treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) during the remission-induction phase of psoriasis treatment. METHODS: In a 32-week, open-label, two-way cross-over study, patients (n=20, seven men, aged 35-70 years) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive MTX plus FA (20 mg/week) for 16 weeks followed by MTX monotherapy (three doses of MTX separated by 12-h intervals once a week) for an additional 16 weeks (treatment arm A, n=10) or to receive the opposite sequence of treatments (arm B, n=10). Dosing of MTX was individualised with the help of pre-study evaluation of plasma MTX pharmacokinetics. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), biochemistry and haematology tests and erythrocyte concentration of MTX polyglutamates (MTXPG) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: In arms A and B, the mean (range) concentrations of MTXPG (nmol/L) were comparable [week 16: 96.2 (32.0-157) vs. 111 (73.7-175), P=0.32; week 32: 103 (55.8-173) vs. 83.6 (27.4-129), P=0.24]. After 16 weeks, the mean+/-SEM PASI decreased from 20.1+/-2.1 to 8.8+/-1.3 in arm A, while a greater reduction from 27.2+/-2.1 to 5.1+/-1.0 occurred in arm B (P&lt;0.001). Positive correlations were found between the percent improvement in PASI at week 16 and the ratios of the concentration of MTXPG to plasma folate (rho=0.59, P=0.008) or RBC folate concentration (rho=0.56, P=0.013). Due to an accelerated decline in PASI in arm A and a trend to its worsening in arm B after crossing over of treatments, the mean absolute PASI scores in both arms were comparable at week 32. CONCLUSION: The antipsoriatic effect of MTX during the remission-induction phase of treatment is influenced by folate status and may be significantly less if combined treatment with FA is used, irrespective of pre-treatment folate levels. The individual tailoring of MTX dosing needs further attention because the mean percent PASI improvement from baseline was 83% and the inter-patient variability in response was low after 16 weeks of monotherapy with MTX.",M1

The SPIO-PEG-FA nanoparticles are well-dispersed and have good stability in various pH solutions. The lack of hysterestis and remanence at ambient temperatures is characteristic of superparamagnetic materials for SPIO-PEG-FA. The uptake by macrophage for SPIO-PEG-FA is lower than that of Feridex I.V. even at higher concentration. Internalization of SPIO-PEG-FA in targeted cells (KB cells) was observed by flow-cytometric analysis and in vitro MR imaging. The intensity change of positive KB cell tumor (-20 to 25%) is significantly lower than that of negative HT-1080 cell tumor from precontrast to postcontrast images of the tumor by in vivo MR imaging. These preliminary results demonstrated that SPIO-PEG-FA have the ability to target folate receptor.",M1
18043498,"Will increasing folic acid in fortified grain products further reduce neural tube defects without causing harm?: consideration of the evidence.To reduce neural tube defects (NTDs), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated that by January 1998 all enriched grain products should contain 140 microg of folic acid (<e>FA</e>)/100 g of flour. Groups concerned with optimal prevention of NTDs had argued that the level should be 350 microg/100 g. However, when it appeared that the debate might delay implementation of any fortification, these groups petitioned the FDA to implement fortification at the originally proposed level of 140 microg/100 g, anticipating that the FDA might consider increasing the level at a later time. Mandated FA fortification (FAF) has now been in place in the United States for 9 y. The impact of this important public health intervention on NTD rates, the possible benefit to other disease conditions, and potential harms have been evaluated. As background for a possible request that the FDA consider increasing FAF, evidence bearing on the question of whether an increase can further reduce NTD births without causing harm is reviewed here. The published data indicate that it is appropriate that the FDA conduct or commission a balanced analysis of the evidence by scientists who will act on that evidence to decide this important question.",M1

18038943,"Folic acid fortification and supplementation--good for some but not so good for others.Evidence has established the protective effect of folic acid (<e>FA</e>) fortification and periconceptional supplementation on neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid fortification and periconceptional supplementation of women may reduce the risk of certain childhood cancers in their offspring. However, recent human studies have suggested that FA supplementation and fortification may promote the progression of already existing, undiagnosed, preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, thereby corroborating earlier observations from animal and in vitro studies. Following the success of mandatory FA fortification on the reduction of NTD rates in the United States and Canada, several countries are currently considering whether or not, and at what dose, to institute FA fortification. Future debates and decisions regarding FA fortification should take into consideration all potential adverse effects and dose-responses of such a measure because it may be associated with very serious consequences for many generations. In addition to careful monitoring of adverse effects, preclinical and population-based studied are warranted in order to determine the efficacy, safety, and potential deleterious effects of FA fortification and supplementation on cancer risk and other health outcomes.",M1
18034701,"Formic acid, a novel metabolite of chronic ethanol abuse, causes neurotoxicity, which is prevented by folic acid.BACKGROUND: Methanol is endogenously formed in the brain and is present as a congener in most alcoholic beverages. Because ethanol is preferentially metabolized over methanol (MeOH) by alcohol dehydrogenase, it is not surprising that MeOH accumulates in the alcohol-abusing population. This suggests that the alcohol-drinking population will have higher levels of MeOH's neurotoxic metabolite, formic acid (<e>FA</e>). FA elimination is mediated by folic acid. Neurotoxicity is a common result of chronic alcoholism. This study shows for the first time that FA, found in chronic alcoholics, is neurotoxic and this toxicity can be mitigated by folic acid administration. OBJECTIVE: To determine if FA levels are higher in the alcohol-drinking population and to assess its neurotoxicity in organotypic hippocampal rat brain slice cultures. Methods: Serum and CSF FA was measured in samples from both ethanol abusing and control patients, who presented to a hospital emergency department. FA's neurotoxicity and its reversibility by folic acid were assessed using organotypic rat brain hippocampal slice cultures using clinically relevant concentrations. RESULTS: Serum FA levels in the alcoholics (mean +/- SE: 0.416 +/- 0.093 mmol/l, n = 23) were significantly higher than in controls (mean +/- SE: 0.154 +/- 0.009 mmol/l, n = 82) (p &lt; 0.0002). FA was not detected in the controls' CSF (n = 20), whereas it was &gt;0.15 mmol/l in CSF of 3 of the 4 alcoholic cases. Low doses of FA from 1 to 5 mmol/l added for 24, 48 or 72 hours to the rat brain slice cultures caused neuronal death as measured by propidium iodide staining. When folic acid (1 micromol/l) was added with the FA, neuronal death was prevented. CONCLUSIONS: Formic acid may be a significant factor in the neurotoxicity of ethanol abuse. This neurotoxicity can be mitigated by folic acid administration at a clinically relevant dose.",M1

PEGylation of CPMV completely eliminated background binding of the virus to tumor cells. The PEG-folate moiety allowed CPMV-specific recognition of tumor cells bearing the folate receptor. In addition, by testing CPMV formulations with different amounts of the PEG-<e>FA</e> moiety displayed on the surface, we show that higher-density loading of targeting ligands on CPMV may not be necessary for efficient targeting to tumor cells.

20407210,"FAVL elevation in human tumors disrupts Fanconi anemia pathway signaling and promotes genomic instability and tumor growth.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare human genetic disease caused by mutations in any one of 13 known genes that encode proteins functioning in one common signaling pathway, the FA pathway, or in unknown genes. One characteristic of FA is an extremely high incidence of cancer, indicating the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression. However, the role of this pathway in the development and progression of human cancers in individuals who do not have FA has not been clearly determined. Here, we report that elevated expression of what we believe to be a novel splice variant of FA complementation group L (FANCL), which we identified and named FAVL, can impair the FA pathway in non-FA human tumor cells and act as a tumor promoting factor. FAVL expression was elevated in half of the human carcinoma cell lines and carcinoma tissue samples tested. Expression of FAVL resulted in decreased FANCL expression by sequestering FANCL to the cytoplasm and enhancing its degradation. Importantly, this impairment of the FA pathway by FAVL elevation provided human cancer cells with a growth advantage, caused chromosomal instability in vitro, and promoted tumor development in a xenograft mouse model. These data indicate that FAVL impairment of the FA pathway likely contributes to the development of non-FA human cancers and therefore add a challenging layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of human cancer. We further believe that these data will prove useful for developing additional tools for fighting human cancer.",M2

We have identified a homozygous missense mutation in the RAD51C gene in a consanguineous family with multiple severe congenital abnormalities characteristic of FA. RAD51C is a member of the RAD51-like gene family involved in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. The mutation results in loss of RAD51 focus formation in response to DNA damage and in increased cellular sensitivity to the DNA interstrand cross-linking agent mitomycin C and the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin. Thus, biallelic germline mutations in a RAD51 paralog are associated with an FA-like syndrome.",M2

The aim of this study was to assess the stimulated salivary flow rate (SSFR) and calcium, urea, total protein, and amylase levels in saliva of FA patients. METHODS: Stimulated whole saliva was collected from 34 randomly selected FA patients and 34 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Both samples were analyzed for salivary flow rate, calcium, urea, total proteins, and amylase. The SSFR was analyzed by gravimetric method and calcium, urea, total protein, and amylase concentrations were realized by chemistry tests. RESULTS: Mean values of SSFR for experimental and control groups were, respectively, 0.5 mL/min and 0.8 mL/min (P&lt;0.05). Calcium concentration was 36% (P&lt;0.05) and urea concentration was 21% (P&lt;0.01) lower in the FA group saliva compared with saliva from the controls. The saliva concentration of amylase was almost equal in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: FA patients may exhibit significant changes in SSFR, calcium, and urea concentration of saliva.",M2

To understand further the nature of the USP12 and USP46 complexes, we attempted to identify proteins that interact with the USP12 and USP46 deubiquitinating enzyme complexes. We identified WDR20, a WD40-repeat containing protein, as a common binding partner of UAF1, USP12, and USP46. Further analysis showed that WDR20 associates exclusively with USP12 and USP46, not with USP1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the purification of a ternary USP12 x UAF1 x WDR20 complex. Interestingly, and consistent with the binding assays, WDR20 stimulated the enzymatic activity of USP12 x UAF1, but not of USP1 x UAF1. Consistent with our previous report that USP12 and USP46 do not regulate the FA pathway, small interference RNA-mediated depletion of WDR20 protein did not affect the FA pathway or DNA damage responses. We provide a model in which WDR20 serves as a stimulatory subunit for preserving and regulating the activity of the subset of the UAF1 x USP complexes.",M2
20136826,"Haematopoeitic cell transplantation for Fanconi anaemia - when and how?Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the only treatment that can correct the haematological manifestations in patients with Fanconi anaemia. Over the last two decades, sequential changes to the approach to HCT have resulted in reduced regimen-related toxicity, superior engraftment and less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), resulting in improved survival. The two pivotal changes that most influenced these improvements were the addition of fludarabine to the preparative regimen to augment engraftment, and the use of T cell depletion to reduce GVHD. With these improved HCT outcomes, indications for HCT are quite consistent regardless of donor source. Emphasis is now being placed on developing HCT regimens that will improve quality of life by reducing late effects, particularly the risk of malignancy, sterility and endocrinopathies. This paper will review the unique challenges of HCT in <e>FA</e> patients, with particular emphasis on the timing and approach to HCT.",M2
20132664,"Clinical, genetic and cytogenetic study of Fanconi anemia in an Indian population.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease, associated with congenital anomalies and a predisposition to cancers. FA patients exhibit spontaneous chromosome breakage and FA cells are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslink agents and expresses high frequency of chromosome breakage. Recently 13 genes have been shown to be involved with the FA phenotype. We have carried out a detailed study in clinically diagnosed FA patients in an Indian population. Thirty three patients were clinically diagnosed with FA and had aplastic anemia and bleeding abnormalities. The genetic analysis revealed a significantly (P&lt;0.0001) high frequency (36.4%) of parental consanguinity in FA patients compared to controls (3.33%). Chromosomal analysis revealed spontaneous chromosome breakage in 63.64% FA patients. The mitomycin C and diepoxybutane induced cultures showed a significantly (P&lt;0.001) high frequency of chromosome breakage and radial formation compared to controls. Among 33 patients, nine (27.27%) patients developed malignancies and chromosomal abnormalities were detected in five (55.5%) patients bone marrow cells including monosomy 5 and 7, trisomy 10, der(1q) and inv(7). Cytogenetic investigation is important in aplastic anemia to rule out FA. The clinical presentation and the associated high frequency of consanguinity in FA, and the molecular analysis are complementary in the study of an Indian population.",M2
20122765,"The influence of the aziridinyl substituent of benzimidazoles and benzimidazolequinones on toxicity towards normal and Fanconi anaemia cells.Aziridinyl substituted benzimidazolequinones are more toxic than methoxy analogues towards normal human fibroblast cells (GM00637). The aziridinyl substituent is required for hypersensitive killing of Fanconi anaemia (<e>FA</e>) cells (PD20i) deficient in FANCD2. Despite lacking quinone functionality, 4,7-dimethoxy-N-[(aziridin-2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole also induces hypersensitivity from FA cells, similar to their response towards mitomycin C. Expression of FANCD2 (in PD20:RV) corrects FA cell hypersensitivity supporting cellular response via the FANC pathway.",M2
20089964,"Knockdown of Fanconi anemia genes in human embryonic stem cells reveals early developmental defects in the hematopoietic lineage.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pediatric bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies. The effect of FA gene deficiency on hematopoietic development in utero remains poorly described as mouse models of FA do not develop hematopoietic failure and such studies cannot be performed on patients. We have created a human-specific in vitro system to study early hematopoietic development in FA using a lentiviral RNA interference (RNAi) strategy in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We show that knockdown of FANCA and FANCD2 in hESCs leads to a reduction in hematopoietic fates and progenitor numbers that can be rescued by FA gene complementation. Our data indicate that hematopoiesis is impaired in FA from the earliest stages of development, suggesting that deficiencies in embryonic hematopoiesis may underlie the progression to bone marrow failure in FA. This work illustrates how hESCs can provide unique insights into human development and further our understanding of genetic disease.",M2
20075016,"The involvement of FANCM, FANCI, and checkpoint proteins in the interstrand DNA crosslink repair pathway is conserved in C. elegans.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) patients are specifically defective in the repair of interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs), a complex process involving at least 13 FA proteins and other repair/checkpoint proteins. Of the 13 FA proteins, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, and FANCJ were previously found to be functionally conserved in C. elegans. We have also identified C. elegans homologs of FANCM and FANCI, and determined their epistatic relationships with homologs of FANCD2, checkpoint proteins, and RAD51 upon DNA crosslinking. The counterparts of FANCM, FANCI, and three checkpoint proteins (RPA, ATR and CHK1) are required for focus formation and ubiquitination associated with FANCD2 in C. elegans. However, C. elegans FANCM affects neither RPA focus formation nor CHK1 phosphorylation induced by ICLs, unlike the reported role of human FANCM, which influences ATR-CHK1 signaling at stalled replication forks. Although focus formation by both FANCD2 and RAD51 requires ATR-CHK1 signaling, FANCD2 and RAD51 acted independently in the formation of their respective foci. Thus, the FANCD2 activation pathway involving FANCM, FANCI, and the checkpoint proteins is conserved in C. elegans but with distinct differences.",M2
20068062,"Constitutive activation of caspase-3 and Poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage in fanconi anemia cells.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare syndrome characterized by developmental abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposition. Cells from FA patients exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and oxidative stress that may trigger apoptosis. Damage-induced activation of caspases and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes have been described for some of the FA complementation groups. Here, we show the constitutive activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in the FA cells without exposure to exogenous DNA-damaging factors. These effects can be reversed in the presence of reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcystein. We also show the accumulation of oxidized proteins in FA cells, which is accompanied by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha oversecretion and the upregulation of early stress response kinases pERK1/2 and p-P38. Suppression of TNF-alpha secretion by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD98059 results in reduction of caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism of caspases-3 activation in FA cells. Thus, the current study is the first evidence demonstrating the damage-independent activation of caspase-3 and PARP in FA cells, which seems to occur through mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and TNF-alpha oversecretion.",M2
20064461,"FANCM connects the genome instability disorders Bloom's Syndrome and Fanconi Anemia.Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) and Bloom's Syndrome (BS) are genetic disorders characterized by overlapping phenotypes, including aberrant DNA repair and cancer predisposition. Here, we show that the FANCM gene product, FANCM protein, links FA and BS by acting as a protein anchor and bridge that targets key components of the FA and BS pathways to stalled replication forks, thus linking multiple components that are necessary for efficient DNA repair. Two highly conserved protein:protein interaction motifs in FANCM, designated MM1 and MM2, were identified. MM1 interacts with the FA core complex by binding to FANCF, whereas MM2 interacts with RM1 and topoisomerase IIIalpha, components of the BS complex. The MM1 and MM2 motifs were independently required to activate the FA and BS pathways. Moreover, a common phenotype of BS and FA cells-an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges-was due to a loss of interaction of the two complexes through FANCM.",M2

20043851,"Monoketone analogs of curcumin, a new class of Fanconi anemia pathway inhibitors.BACKGROUND: The Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) pathway is a multigene DNA damage response network implicated in the repair of DNA lesions that arise during replication or after exogenous DNA damage. The FA pathway displays synthetic lethal relationship with certain DNA repair genes such as ATM (Ataxia Telangectasia Mutated) that are frequently mutated in tumors. Thus, inhibition of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation (FANCD2-Ub), a key step in the FA pathway, might target tumor cells defective in ATM through synthetic lethal interaction. Curcumin was previously identified as a weak inhibitor of FANCD2-Ub. The aim of this study is to identify derivatives of curcumin with better activity and specificity. RESULTS: Using a replication-free assay in Xenopus extracts, we screened monoketone analogs of curcumin for inhibition of FANCD2-Ub and identified analog EF24 as a strong inhibitor. Mechanistic studies suggest that EF24 targets the FA pathway through inhibition of the NF-kB pathway kinase IKK. In HeLa cells, nanomolar concentrations of EF24 inhibited hydroxyurea (HU)-induced FANCD2-Ub and foci in a cell-cycle independent manner. Survival assays revealed that EF24 specifically sensitizes FA-competent cells to the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C (MMC). In addition, in contrast with curcumin, ATM-deficient cells are twofold more sensitive to EF24 than matched wild-type cells, consistent with a synthetic lethal effect between FA pathway inhibition and ATM deficiency. An independent screen identified 4H-TTD, a compound structurally related to EF24 that displays similar activity in egg extracts and in cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that monoketone analogs of curcumin are potent inhibitors of the FA pathway and constitute a promising new class of targeted anticancer compounds.",M2
20043063,"New aspects on chromosomal instability: chromosomal break-points in Fanconi anemia patients co-localize on the molecular level with fragile sites.Within cytogenetic preparations chromosomal breaks can be observed in patients suffering from Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>), a recessively inherited syndrome with an extremely elevated cancer risk, but also in healthy individuals as so-called fragile sites (FS). It is known that FS cytogenetically co-localize with tumor- and evolutionary-conserved chromosomal break-points. The also suggested co-localization of FS and FA associated break-points (FA-bp) was studied here for the first time systematically by molecular cytogenetics. Metaphase chromosomes were obtained from lymphocytes of two FA patients (FANC-A and FANC-C, respectively). Overall 50.58% of the investigated FA-bp correspond to cytogenetic regions with known FS. A detailed molecular cytogenetic study applying FS-spanning probes revealed that 24/29 (82.8%) of analyzed FS are in concordance with FA-bp. Notably, FA-bp show a distribution pattern deviating from that of Aphidicolin induced FS. FA-bp appear more frequently within GTG-light bands and additionally, a yet unreported correlation was observed between break rate and chromosomal banding level. In future, FA-bp might serve as model for the mapping and analysis of otherwise rarely observable FS.",M2
20023263,"Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome among a cohort of 119 patients with fanconi anemia: morphologic and cytogenetic characteristics.Predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia is a hallmark of Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). Morphologic criteria for MDS in FA are not well established, nor is the significance of clonal chromosomal abnormalities. We reviewed bone marrow samples of 119 FA patients: 23 had MDS, with the most common subtype refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. The presence of MDS was highly correlated with the presence of clonal abnormalities. Neutrophil dysplasia and increased blasts were always associated with the presence of a clone, in contrast with dyserythropoiesis. The most frequent clones had gains of 1q and 3q and/or loss of 7. Karyotype complexity also correlated with MDS. One third of patients with 3q as a sole abnormality had no MDS; patients with 3q and an additional abnormality all had MDS. The data provide a rationale for integrating cytogenetic findings with independently evaluated morphologic findings for monitoring bone marrow status in FA.",M2
20022886,"FANCC suppresses short telomere-initiated telomere sister chromatid exchange.Telomere shortening has been linked to rare human disorders that present with bone marrow failure including Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). FANCC is one of the most commonly mutated FA genes in FA patients and the FANCC subtype tends to have a relatively early onset of bone marrow failure and hematologic malignancies. Here, we studied the role of Fancc in telomere length regulation in mice. Deletion of Fancc (Fancc(-/-)) did not affect telomerase activity, telomere length or telomeric end-capping in a mouse strain possessing intrinsically long telomeres. However, ablation of Fancc did exacerbate telomere attrition when murine bone marrow cells experienced high cell turnover after serial transplantation. When Fancc(-/-) mice were crossed into a telomerase reverse transcriptase heterozygous or null background (Tert(+/-) or Tert(-/-)) with short telomeres, Fancc deficiency led to an increase in the incidence of telomere sister chromatid exchange. In contrast, these phenotypes were not observed in Tert mutant mice with long telomeres. Our data indicate that Fancc deficiency accelerates telomere shortening during high turnover of hematopoietic cells and promotes telomere recombination initiated by short telomeres.",M2
20022637,"Ocular and orbital manifestations of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes: Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita.PURPOSE: The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that share the inability of the bone marrow to produce an adequate number of blood cells. The 4 most frequent syndromes are Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). All 4 syndromes have been associated with various physical abnormalities. As part of a genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility study, we determined the prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations in these 4 syndromes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a patient cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five patients with an IBMFS and 121 of their first-degree relatives were seen in the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, from 2001 to 2007. The patient group included 22 with FA, 28 with DC, 19 with DBA, and 6 with SDS. METHODS: Every participant underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation and digital facial photography with an adhesive paper ruler on the patient's forehead for an internal measure of scale. Interpupillary distance (IPD), inner canthal distance (ICD), outer canthal distance (OCD), palpebral fissure length (PFL), and corneal diameter (CD) were measured. Thirteen of the 22 patients with FA underwent axial length (AL) measurements by A-scan ultrasonography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and prevalence of ophthalmic manifestations. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients with FA had at least 1 abnormal parameter, and 25% of patients had at least 4 abnormal parameters. Eighty-two percent of patients had small palpebral fissures, 69% of patients had simple microphthalmia, 64% of patients had small OCD, 55% of patients had microcornea, 28% of patients had ptosis, and 6% of patients had epicanthal folds. In patients with DC, abnormalities of the lacrimal drainage system (29%) were the most prevalent findings, followed by retinal abnormalities (pigmentary changes, retinal neovascularization, retinal detachment, exudative retinopathy) in 21%, cicatricial entropion with trichiasis and blepharitis in 7% each, and sparse eyelashes and congenital cataract in 3.5% each. No significant ophthalmic abnormalities were seen in patients with DBA or SDS. CONCLUSIONS: Syndrome-specific ocular findings are associated with FA and DC and may antedate diagnosis of the specific syndrome. Early recognition of these abnormalities is important for optimal management.",M2
19934329,"Embryonic lethality after combined inactivation of Fancd2 and Mlh1 in mice.DNA repair defects are frequently encountered in human cancers. These defects are utilized by traditional therapeutics but also offer novel cancer treatment strategies based on synthetic lethality. To determine the consequences of combined Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) and mismatch repair pathway inactivation, defects in Fancd2 and Mlh1 were combined in one mouse model. Fancd2/Mlh1 double-mutant embryos displayed growth retardation resulting in embryonic lethality and significant underrepresentation among progeny. Additional inactivation of Trp53 failed to improve the survival of Fancd2/Mlh1-deficient embryos. Mouse fibroblasts were obtained and challenged with cross-linking agents. Fancd2-deficient cells displayed the FA-characteristic growth inhibition after mitomycin C (MMC) exposure. In primary fibroblasts, the absence of Mlh1 did not greatly affect the MMC sensitivity of Fancd2-deficient and Fancd2-proficient cells. However, in Trp53 mutant immortalized fibroblasts, Mlh1 deficiency reduced the growth-inhibiting effect of MMC in Fancd2 mutant and complemented cells. Similar data were obtained using psoralen/UVA, signifying that MLH1 influences the cellular sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links. Next, the effect of MLH1 deficiency on the formation of chromosomal aberrations in response to cross-linking agents was determined. Surprisingly, Mlh1 mutant fibroblasts displayed a modest but noticeable decrease in induced chromosomal breakage and interchange frequencies, suggesting that MLH1 promotes interstrand cross-link repair catastrophe. In conclusion, the combined inactivation of Fancd2 and Mlh1 did not result in synthetic lethality at the cellular level. Although the absence of Fancd2 sensitized Mlh1/Trp53 mutant fibroblasts to MMC, the differential survival of primary and immortalized fibroblasts advocates against systemic inactivation of FANCD2 to enhance treatment of MLH1-deficient tumors.",M2
19934314,"Targeting the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway circumvents drug resistance in multiple myeloma.The Fanconi anemia/BRCA (<e>FA</e>/BRCA) DNA damage repair pathway plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to replicative stress induced by DNA alkylating agents and greatly influences drug response in cancer treatment. We recently reported that FA/BRCA genes are overexpressed and causative for drug resistance in human melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines. However, the transcriptional regulation of the FA/BRCA pathway is not understood. In this report, we describe for the first time a novel function of the NF-kappaB subunits, RelB/p50, as transcriptional activators of the FA/BRCA pathway. Specifically, our findings point to constitutive phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase alpha and subsequent alterations in FANCD2 expression and function as underlying events leading to melphalan resistance in repeatedly exposed multiple myeloma cells. Inhibiting NF-kappaB by small interfering RNA, blocking the IkappaB kinase complex with BMS-345541, or using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib drastically reduced FA/BRCA gene expression and FANCD2 protein expression in myeloma cells, resulting in diminished DNA damage repair and enhanced melphalan sensitivity. Importantly, we also found that bortezomib decreases FA/BRCA gene expression in multiple myeloma patients. These results show for the first time that NF-kappaB transcriptionally regulates the FA/BRCA pathway and provide evidence for targeting Fanconi anemia-mediated DNA repair to enhance chemotherapeutic response and circumvent drug resistance in myeloma patients.",M2
19850743,"TLR8-dependent TNF-(alpha) overexpression in Fanconi anemia group C cells.Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production is abnormally high in Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) cells and contributes to the hematopoietic defects seen in FA complementation group C-deficient (Fancc(-/-)) mice. Applying gene expression microarray and proteomic methods to studies on FANCC-deficient cells we found that genes encoding proteins directly involved in ubiquitinylation are overrepresented in the signature of FA bone marrow cells and that ubiquitinylation profiles of FA-C and complemented cells were substantially different. Finding that Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) was one of the proteins ubiquitinylated only in mutant cells, we confirmed that TLR8 (or a TLR8-associated protein) is ubiquitinylated in mutant FA-C cells and that TNF-alpha production in mutant cells depended upon TLR8 and the canonical downstream signaling intermediates interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and IkappaB kinase-alpha/beta. FANCC-deficient THP-1 cells and macrophages from Fancc(-/-) mice overexpressed TNF-alpha in response to TLR8 agonists but not other TLR agonists. Ectopically expressed FANCC point mutants were capable of fully complementing the mitomycin-C hypersensitivity phenotype of FA-C cells but did not suppress TNF-alpha overproduction. In conclusion, FANCC suppresses TNF-alpha production in mononuclear phagocytes by suppressing TLR8 activity and this particular function of FANCC is independent of its function in protecting the genome from cross-linking agents.",M2

A FA patient started to receive deferiprone (L1) therapy due to iron overload. We report here that the white blood cell counts, hemoglobin (Hb) levels and platelet counts were significantly higher during the L1-treated period than when without L1 therapy.

19774700,"Fanconi anemia proteins and endogenous stresses.Each of the thirteen identified Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) genes is required for resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C, cisplatin, and melphalan. While these agents are excellent tools for understanding the function of FA proteins in DNA repair, it is uncertain whether a defect in the removal of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) is the basis for the pathophysiology of FA. For example, DNA interstrand crosslinking agents induce other types of DNA damage, in addition to ICLs. Further, other DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, activate the FA pathway, leading to monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. Also, FA patients display congenital abnormalities, hematologic deficiencies, and a predisposition to cancer in the absence of an environmental source of ICLs that is external to cells. Here we consider potential sources of endogenous DNA damage, or endogenous stresses, to which FA proteins may respond. These include ICLs formed by products of lipid peroxidation, and other forms of oxidative DNA damage. FA proteins may also potentially respond to telomere shortening or replication stress. Defining these endogenous sources of DNA damage or stresses is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of deficiencies for FA proteins.We propose that FA proteins are centrally involved in the response to replication stress, including replication stress arising from oxidative DNA damage.",M2
19748926,"Involvement of p29 in DNA damage responses and Fanconi anemia pathway.Human p29 is a chromatin-associated protein and the silencing of p29 expression increases cell population in G(1) phase and decreases phosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2 in response to UV treatment. To further characterize the function of p29, U2OS and Fanconi anemia complementation group G (<e>FA</e>-G) cells with constitutive p29 expression have been established. Analyses of these cells identified increased phosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2, which were accompanied by elevated amounts of chromatin-associated Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and ATR-IP. Monoubiquitination of the FA ID complex was restored in p29 stably expressing FA-G cells. Moreover, lower tumor incidence was observed in mp29 transgenic mice after UV irradiation.

19738377,"Topo IIIalpha and BLM act within the Fanconi anemia pathway in response to DNA-crosslinking agents.The Bloom protein (BLM) and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are found in association with proteins of the Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) pathway, a disorder manifesting increased cellular sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. In order to determine if the association reflects a functional interaction for the maintenance of genome stability, we have analyzed the effects of siRNA-mediated depletion of the proteins in human cells. Depletion of Topoisomerase IIIalpha or BLM leads to increased radial formation, as is seen in FA. BLM and Topoisomerase IIIalpha are epistatic to the FA pathway for suppression of radial formation in response to DNA interstrand crosslinks since depletion of either of them in FA cells does not increase radial formation. Depletion of Topoisomerase IIIalpha or BLM also causes an increase in sister chromatid exchanges, as is seen in Bloom syndrome cells. Human Fanconi anemia cells, however, do not demonstrate increased sister chromatid exchanges, separating this response from radial formation. Primary cell lines from mice defective in both Blm and Fancd2 have the same interstrand crosslink-induced genome instability as cells from mice deficient in the Fancd2 protein alone. These observations demonstrate that the association of BLM and Topoisomerase IIIalpha with Fanconi proteins is a functional one, delineating a BLM-Topoisomerase IIIalpha-Fanconi pathway that is critical for suppression of chromosome radial formation.",M2
19737859,"Mutational analysis of FANCL, FANCM and the recently identified FANCI suggests that among the 13 known Fanconi Anemia genes, only FANCD1/BRCA2 plays a major role in high-risk breast cancer predisposition.Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare recessive syndrome characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-cross-linking agents. To date, 13 FA complementation groups have been described and all 13 genes associated to each of these groups have been currently identified. Three of the known FA genes are also high-risk (FANCD1/BRCA2) or moderate-risk (FANCN/PALB2 and FANCJ/BRIP1) breast cancer susceptibility genes, which makes all members of the FA pathway particularly attractive breast cancer candidate genes. Most FA genes have been screened for mutations in breast cancer families negative for BRCA1/2 mutations but the role of FANCL, FANCM and the recently identified FANCI has not been evaluated to date. This fact and novel data sustaining greater functional relevance of the three genes within the FA pathway prompted us to scrutinize all coding sequences and splicing sites of FANCI, FANCL and FANCM in 95 BRCA1/2-negative index cases from Spanish high-risk breast cancer families. We identified 68 sequence variants of which 24 were coding and 44 non-coding. Six exonic and 26 non-coding variants had not been described previously. None of the coding changes caused clearly pathogenic changes and computational analysis of all non-described intronic variants did not revealed major impact in splicing. With the present study, all known FA genes have been evaluated within the context of breast cancer high-risk predisposition. Our results rule out a major role of FANCI, FANCL and FANCM in familial breast cancer susceptibility, suggesting that among the 13 known FA genes, only FANCD1/BRCA2 plays a major role in high-risk breast cancer predisposition.",M2
19704162,"Functional interaction between the Fanconi Anemia D2 protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via a conserved putative PCNA interaction motif.Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare recessive disease characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and cancer susceptibility. The FA proteins and the familial breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and FANCD1/BRCA2, function cooperatively in the FA-BRCA pathway to repair damaged DNA and to prevent cellular transformation. Activation of this pathway occurs via the mono-ubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein, targeting it to nuclear foci where it co-localizes with FANCD1/BRCA2, RAD51, and PCNA. The regulation of the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, as well as its function in DNA repair remain poorly understood. In this study, we have further characterized the interaction between the FANCD2 and PCNA proteins. We have identified a highly conserved, putative FANCD2 PCNA interaction motif (PIP-box), and demonstrate that mutation of this motif disrupts FANCD2-PCNA binding and precludes the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2. Consequently, the FANCD2 PIP-box mutant protein fails to correct the mitomycin C hypersensitivity of FA-D2 patient cells. Our results suggest that PCNA may function as a molecular platform to facilitate the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and activation of the FA-BRCA pathway.",M2

19622404,"Cellular and molecular consequences of defective Fanconi anemia proteins in replication-coupled DNA repair: mechanistic insights.The Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) molecular network consists of 15  FANC  proteins, of which 13 are associated with mutations in patients with this cancer-prone chromosome instability disorder. Whereas historically the common phenotype associated with FA mutations is marked sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, the literature supports a more global role for FANC proteins in coping with diverse stresses encountered by replicative polymerases. We have attempted to reconcile and integrate numerous observations into a model in which FANC proteins coordinate the following physiological events during DNA crosslink repair: (a) activating a FANCM-ATR-dependent S-phase checkpoint, (b) mediating enzymatic replication-fork breakage and crosslink unhooking, (c) filling the resulting gap by translesion synthesis (TLS) by error-prone polymerase(s), and (d) restoring the resulting one-ended double-strand break by homologous recombination repair (HRR). The FANC core subcomplex (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L, FAAP100) promotes TLS for both crosslink and non-crosslink damage such as spontaneous oxidative base damage, UV-C photoproducts, and alkylated bases. TLS likely helps prevent stalled replication forks from breaking, thereby maintaining chromosome continuity. Diverse DNA damages and replication inhibitors result in monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI complex by the FANCL ubiquitin ligase activity of the core subcomplex upon its recruitment to chromatin by the FANCM-FAAP24 heterodimeric translocase. We speculate that this translocase activity acts as the primary damage sensor and helps remodel blocked replication forks to facilitate checkpoint activation and repair. Monoubiquitination of FANCD2-FANCI is needed for promoting HRR, in which the FANCD1/BRCA2 and FANCN/PALB2 proteins act at an early step. We conclude that the core subcomplex is required for both TLS and HRR occurring separately for non-crosslink damages and for both events during crosslink repair. The FANCJ/BRIP1/BACH1 helicase functions in association with BRCA1 and may remove structural barriers to replication, such as guanine quadruplex structures, and/or assist in crosslink unhooking.",M2

19572808,"Bone marrow microenvironment in fanconi anemia: a prospective functional study in a cohort of fanconi anemia patients.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare condition due to the genetic inactivation of the FA/BRCA pathway. During childhood, most FA patients display progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), the mechanism of which has not been clarified to date. We analyzed BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from a series of 20 FA patients with BMF (patient median age 12.5 years old, range 7-34). Expression of FANCD2 and sensitivity to mitomycin C, differentiation capacities, and hematopoiesis-supporting abilities, as well as proliferation, cell senescence, and telomere length were assessed. FA MSCs demonstrated hypersensitivity to mitomycin C compared to control MSCs, as expected for FA cells. FA MSCs had normal immunophenotype, support long-term culture of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and display normal differentiation capacities. Telomere loss during cell aging was similar for FA and control MSCs. However, FA MSCs showed reduced long-term proliferation ability, higher stem cell factor and interleukin-6 levels, and increased expression of senescent-associated beta-galactosidase compared to normal MSCs, suggesting a potential role of the BM microenvironment in long-term BMF.",M2
19564748,"Better posttransplant outcome with fludarabine based conditioning in multitransfused fanconi anemia patients who underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.Several investigators have been looking for less toxic conditioning regimen for stem cell transplantation in Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) patients because of sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and tendency to malignancy. We report 16 multitransfused FA patients who underwent peripheral stem cell transplantation from 13 related and 3 unrelated donors. Although the first 6 patients received thoraco-abdominal irradiation + cyclophosphamide + antithymocyte globulin (regimen A) for conditioning, fludarabine (FLU) + cyclophosphamide + antithymocyte globulin (regimen B) were used in the last 10 patients in which 3 of them received unrelated graft. Cyclosporin A was given alone for the related allografts but also included mycophenolate mofetil for the unrelated allograft as graft versus host disease prophylaxis. We observed a lower risk of peritransplant morbidity and mortality with fewer and milder graft versus host disease in FLU based group. We lost 3 patients in regimen A group and 1 of them from secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Three patients are alive with transfusion independent. In regimen B group, 9 of 10 patients are alive with normal hematologic parameters and full donor chimerism. The longest follow-up durations are 90 and 60 months in regimen A and B, respectively. In conclusion, FLU based conditioning is more effective and successful with lower toxicity in multitransfused FA patients. However, it needs more experience and longer follow up duration.",M2
19561169,"Fancm-deficient mice reveal unique features of Fanconi anemia complementation group M.The Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) core complex member FANCM remodels synthetic replication forks and recombination intermediates. Thus far, only one FA patient with FANCM mutations has been described, but the relevance of these mutations for the FA phenotype is uncertain. To provide further experimental access to the FA-M complementation group we have generated Fancm-deficient mice by deleting exon 2. FANCM deficiency caused hypogonadism in mice and hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), thus phenocopying other FA mouse models. However, Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice also showed unique features atypical for FA mice, including underrepresentation of female Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice and decreased overall and tumor-free survival. This increased cancer incidence may be correlated to the role of FANCM in the suppression of spontaneous sister chromatid exchanges as observed in MEFs. In addition, FANCM appeared to have a stimulatory rather than essential role in FANCD2 monoubiquitination. The FA-M mouse model presented here suggests that FANCM functions both inside and outside the FA core complex to maintain genome stability and to prevent tumorigenesis.",M2
19519404,"FANCJ helicase operates in the Fanconi Anemia DNA repair pathway and the response to replicational stress.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, progressive bone marrow failure, and high cancer risk. Cells from FA patients exhibit spontaneous chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents. Although the precise mechanistic details of the FA/BRCA pathway of ICL-repair are not well understood, progress has been made in the identification of the FA proteins that are required for the pathway. Among the 13 FA complementation groups from which all the FA genes have been cloned, only a few of the FA proteins are predicted to have direct roles in DNA metabolism. One of the more recently identified FA proteins, shown to be responsible for complementation of the FA complementation group J, is the BRCA1 Associated C-terminal Helicase (BACH1, designated FANCJ), originally identified as a protein associated with breast cancer. FANCJ has been proposed to function downstream of FANCD2 monoubiquitination, a critical event in the FA pathway. Evidence supports a role for FANCJ in a homologous recombination (HR) pathway of double strand break (DSB) repair. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge in terms of FANCJ functions through its enzymatic activities and protein interactions. The molecular roles of FANCJ in DNA repair and the response to replicational stress will be discussed.",M2

Childhood onset of aplastic anemia is one of the hallmarks of this condition. Supportive therapy in the form of blood products, androgens, and hematopoietic growth factors may boost blood counts temporarily. However, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) currently remains the only curative treatment option for the hematologic manifestations of Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). Here we review current clinical and pre-clinical strategies for treating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure, including the experience with mobilizing and collecting CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as target cells for somatic gene therapy, the current state of FA gene therapy trials, and future prospects for cell and gene therapy.",M2
19473116,"Elevated levels of IL-1beta in Fanconi anaemia group A patients due to a constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway are capable of promoting tumour cell proliferation.<e>FA</e> (Fanconi anaemia) is a hereditary disease characterized by congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure and an extraordinary elevated predisposition to develop cancer. In the present manuscript we describe an anomalous high level of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta (interleukin-1beta) present in the serum of FA patients. The elevated levels of IL-1beta were completely reverted by transduction of a wild-type copy of the FancA cDNA into FA-A (FA group A) lymphocytes. Although the transcription factor NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) is a well established regulator of IL-1beta expression, our experiments did not show any proof of elevated NF-kappaB activity in FA-A cells. However, we found that the overexpression of IL-1beta in FA-A cells is related to a constitutively activated PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-Akt pathway in these cells. We provide evidence that the effect of Akt on IL-1beta activation is mediated by the inhibition of GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase 3beta). Finally, our data indicate that the levels of IL-1beta produced by FA-A lymphoblasts are enough to promote an activation of the cell cycle in primary glioblastoma progenitor cells. Together, these results demonstrate that the constitutive activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in FA cells upregulates the expression of IL-1beta through an NF-kappaB-independent mechanism and that this overproduction activates the proliferation of tumour cells.",M2
19464302,"Genotype-phenotype correlations in Fanconi anemia.Although still incomplete, we now have a remarkably detailed and nuanced picture of both phenotypic and genotypic components of the <e>FA</e> spectrum. Initially described as a combination of pancytopenia with a limited number of physical anomalies, it was later recognized that additional features were compatible with the FA phenotype, including a form without detectable malformations (Estren-Dameshek variant). The discovery of somatic mosaicism extended the boundaries of the FA phenotype to cases even without any overt hematological manifestations. This clinical heterogeneity was augmented by new conceptualizations. There was the realization of a constant risk for the development of myelodysplasia and certain malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma, and there was the emergence of a distinctive cellular phenotype. A striking degree of genetic heterogeneity became apparent with the delineation of at least 12 complementation groups and the identification of their underlying genes. Although functional genetic insights have fostered the interpretation of many phenotypic features, surprisingly few stringent genotype-phenotype connections have emerged. In addition to myriad genetic alterations, less predictable influences are likely to modulate the FA phenotype, including modifier genes, environmental factors and chance effects. In reviewing the current status of genotype-phenotype correlations, we arrive at a unifying hypothesis to explain the remarkably wide range of FA phenotypes. Given the large body of evidence that genomic instability is a major underlying mechanism of accelerated ageing phenotypes, we propose that the numerous FA variants can be viewed as differential modulations and compression in time of intrinsic biological ageing.",M2
19427512,"RAD51D- and FANCG-dependent base substitution mutagenesis at the ATP1A1 locus in mammalian cells.Elaborate processes act at the DNA replication fork to minimize the generation of chromatid discontinuity when lesions are encountered. To prevent collapse of stalled replication forks, mutagenic translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases are recruited temporarily to bypass DNA lesions. When a replication-associated (one-ended) double-strand break occurs, homologous recombination repair (HRR) can restore chromatid continuity in what has traditionally been regarded as an  error-free  process. Our previous mutagenesis studies show an important role for HRR in preventing deletions and rearrangements that would otherwise result from error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) after fork breakage. An analogous, but distinct, role in minimizing mutations is attributed to the proteins defective in the cancer predisposition disease Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). Cells from FA patients and model systems show an increased proportion of gene-disrupting deletions at the hprt locus as well as decreased mutation rates in the hprt assay, suggesting a role for the FANC proteins in promoting TLS, HRR, and possibly also NHEJ. It remains unclear whether HRR, like the FANC pathway, impacts the rate of base substitution mutagenesis. Therefore, we measured, in isogenic rad51d and fancg CHO mutants, mutation rates at the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit (ATP1A1) locus using ouabain resistance, which specifically detects base substitution mutations. Surprisingly, we found that the spontaneous mutation rate was reduced approximately 2.5-fold in rad51d knockout cells, an even greater extent than observed in fancg cells, when compared with parental and isogenic gene-complemented control lines. A approximately 2-fold reduction in induced mutations in rad51d cells was seen after treatment with the DNA alkylating agent ethylnitrosurea while a lesser reduction occurred in fancg cells. Should the model ATP1A1 locus be representative of the genome, we conclude that at least 50% of base substitution mutations in this mammalian system arise through error-prone polymerase(s) acting during HRR-mediated restart of broken replication forks.",M2
19423727,"Impaired FANCD2 monoubiquitination and hypersensitivity to camptothecin uniquely characterize Fanconi anemia complementation group M.FANCM is a component of the Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) core complex and one FA patient (EUFA867) with biallelic mutations in FANCM has been described. Strikingly, we found that EUFA867 also carries biallelic mutations in FANCA. After correcting the FANCA defect in EUFA867 lymphoblasts, a  clean  FA-M cell line was generated. These cells were hypersensitive to mitomycin C, but unlike cells defective in other core complex members, FANCM(-/-) cells were proficient in monoubiquitinating FANCD2 and were sensitive to the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin, a feature shared only with the FA subtype D1 and N. In addition, FANCM(-/-) cells were sensitive to UV light. FANCM and a C-terminal deletion mutant rescued the cross-linker sensitivity of FANCM(-/-) cells, whereas a FANCM ATPase mutant did not. Because both mutants restored the formation of FANCD2 foci, we conclude that FANCM functions in an FA core complex-dependent and -independent manner.",M2

Eight FA proteins (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL and FANCM) and three non-FA proteins (FAAP100, FAAP24 and HES1) form an FA nuclear core complex, which is required for monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer upon DNA damage. FANCL possesses a PHD/RING-finger domain and is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the core complex. In this study, we report an FA patient with an unusual presentation belonging to the FA-L complementation group. The patient lacks an obvious FA phenotype except for the presence of a café-au-lait spot, mild hypocellularity and a family history of leukemia. The molecular diagnosis and identification of the FA subgroup was achieved by FA complementation assay. We identified bi-allelic novel mutations in the FANCL gene and functionally characterized them.

Eight FA proteins (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L and -M) and three non-FA proteins (FAAP100, FAAP24 and HES1) form the FA nuclear core complex that is required for monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer upon DNA damage. The other three FA proteins, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1 and FANCN/PALB2, act in parallel or downstream of the FANCD2-FANCI dimer. Despite the isolation and characterization of several FA proteins, the mechanism by which these proteins protect cells from DNA interstrand crosslinking agents has been unclear. This is because a majority of the FA proteins lack any recognizable functional domains that can provide insight into their function. The recently discovered FANCM (Hef) and FANCJ (BRIP1/BACH1) proteins contain helicase domains, providing potential insight into the role of FA proteins in DNA repair. FANCM with its partner, FAAP24, and FANCJ bind and metabolize a variety of DNA substrates.

19371427,"CHK1 inhibition as a strategy for targeting Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) DNA repair pathway deficient tumors.BACKGROUND: DNA repair deficient tumor cells have been shown to accumulate high levels of DNA damage. Consequently, these cells become hyper-dependent on DNA damage response pathways, including the CHK1-kinase-mediated response. These observations suggest that DNA repair deficient tumors should exhibit increased sensitivity to CHK1 inhibition. Here we offer experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis. RESULTS: Using isogenic pairs of cell lines differing only in the Fanconi Anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, we showed that FA deficient cell lines were hypersensitive to CHK1 silencing by independent siRNAs as well as CHK1 pharmacologic inhibition by Gö6976 and UCN-01. In parallel, an siRNA screen designed to identify gene silencings synthetically lethal with CHK1 inhibition identified genes required for FA pathway function. To confirm these findings in vivo, we demonstrated that whole zebrafish embryos, depleted for FANCD2 by a morpholino approach, were hypersensitive to Gö6976. Silencing of FA genes led to hyper-activation of CHK1 and vice versa. Furthermore, inactivation of CHK1 in FA deficient cell lines caused increased accumulation of DNA strand and chromosomal breakages. These results suggest that the functions subserved by CHK1 and the FA pathway mutually compensate in maintaining genome integrity. As CHK1 inhibition has been under clinical trial in combination with cisplatin, we showed that the FA specific tumoricidal effect of CHK1 inhibition and cisplatin was synergistic. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest CHK1 inhibition as a strategy for targeting FA deficient tumors.",M2
19353625,"First phase insulin release and glucose tolerance in children with Fanconi anemia after hematopoietic cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is an autosomal and X-linked recessive disease of chromosomal instability, which results in bone marrow failure. Children with FA have been shown to have an increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). PROCEDURE: A cross-sectional study of glucose and insulin metabolism was conducted in 17 children with FA who had undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) at the University of Minnesota. First phase insulin release (FPIR) was determined by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), lipid panel, blood pressure, and medical history were reviewed for additional metabolic abnormalities. RESULTS: Seventeen FA participants, median age 11.3 (range 5.5-17.6) years, were evaluated. IVGTT identified three separate groups: low FPIR, normal FPIR, and high FPIR. Those with low FPIR were more likely to have low BMI, but had normal glucose levels. Those with high FPIR, had high BMI, elevated lipids, and body fat. One patient with normal FPIR had impaired glucose tolerance and another with normal FPIR had impaired fasting glucose. No participant was diagnosed with DM by fasting glucose, 2 hr glucose during OGTT, or hemoglobin A1C. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with FA had normal glucose tolerance and normal beta-cell function after HCT. Two small subsets of patients had lower than expected and higher than expected FPIR. The clinical significance of these differences is not yet known given the normal glucose tolerance and fasting glucose levels in these two groups.",M2

These improvements have been made despite the fact that a definitive cellular function for the proteins in the FA pathway has yet to be elucidated. Delineating the cellular functions of the FA pathway could help further improve the treatment options for FA patients and further reduce the probability of succumbing to the disease.

Although FA has been defined as a DNA repair disease based on the hypersensitivity of patient cells to DNA cross-linking agents, FA patients develop various developmental defects such as skeletal abnormalities, microphthalmia, and endocrine abnormalities that may be linked to transcriptional defects. Recently, we reported that the FA core complex interacts with the transcriptional repressor Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) suggesting that the core complex plays a role in transcription. Here we show that the FA core complex contributes to transcriptional regulation of HES1-responsive genes, including HES1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(cip1/waf1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that the FA core complex interacts with the HES1 promoter but not the p21(cip1/waf1) promoter. Furthermore, we show that the FA core complex interferes with HES1 binding to the co-repressor transducin-like-Enhancer of Split, suggesting that the core complex affects transcription both directly and indirectly. Taken together these data suggest a novel function of the FA core complex in transcriptional regulation.",M2
19287902,"FANCD2 Western blot as a diagnostic tool for Brazilian patients with Fanconi anemia.Fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease showing genetic heterogeneity due to a variety of mutations in genes involved in DNA repair pathways, which may lead to different clinical manifestations. Phenotypic variability makes diagnosis difficult based only on clinical manifestations, therefore laboratory tests are necessary. New advances in molecular pathogenesis of this disease led researchers to develop a diagnostic test based on Western blot for FANCD2. The objective of the present study was to determine the efficacy of this method for the diagnosis of 84 Brazilian patients with Fanconi anemia, all of whom tested positive for the diepoxybutane test, and 98 healthy controls. The FANCD2 monoubiquitinated isoform (FANCDS+/FANCD2L-) was not detected in 77 patients (91.7%). In 2 patients (2.4%), there was an absence of both the monoubiquitinated and the non-ubiquitinated proteins (FANCD2S-/FANCD2L-) and 5 patients (5.9%) had both isoforms (FANCD2S+/FANCD2L+). This last phenotype suggests downstream subtypes or mosaicism. All controls were diepoxybutane negative and were also negative on the FANCD2 Western blot. The Western blot for FANCD2 presented a sensitivity of 94% (79/84) and specificity of 100% (98/98). This method was confirmed as an efficient approach to screen Brazilian patients with deleterious mutations on FANCD2 (FANCD2S-/FANCD2L-) or other upstream genes of the <e>FA</e>/BRCA pathway (FANCDS+/FANCD2L-), to confirm the chromosome breakage test and to classify patients according to the level of FA/BRCA pathway defects.

19282663,"FANCM-FAAP24 and HCLK2: roles in ATR signalling and the Fanconi anemia pathway.The ATR signalling pathway coordinates the cellular response to replication stress, which is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. HCLK2/Tel2 is a highly conserved orphan protein that binds directly to ATR and other PI3-kinase related kinases and plays a central role in checkpoint signalling responses.(1) Proteomic analyses of HCLK2 complexes confirmed ATR, ATRIP and DNA-PKcs as HCLK2 interacting factors and also uncovered two surprising interacting proteins, the heterodimeric Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) proteins FANCM and FAAP24. Our subsequent findings that ATR signalling is attenuated in FANCM and FAAP24-depleted cells, together with recent biochemical studies, suggested that remodelling of stalled replication forks by FANCM-FAAP24 is required to facilitate efficient activation of ATR signalling in response to replication stress.(2) Furthermore, our study revealed that the DNA translocase activity of FANCM is essential for efficient activation of the ATR signalling, a function that is separate and distinct from its role in targeting the FA core complex to sites of DNA damage. In this review we discuss the importance of these findings in the context of recent data and raise questions regarding the role of HCLK2 and FANCM-FAAP24 in human disease.",M2
19277017,"Lentiviral-mediated genetic correction of hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cells from Fanconi anemia patients.Previous clinical trials based on the genetic correction of purified CD34(+) cells with gamma-retroviral vectors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in different monogenic diseases, including X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immunodeficiency and chronic granulomatous disease. Similar protocols, however, failed to engraft Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) patients with genetically corrected cells. In this study, we first aimed to correlate the hematological status of 27 FA patients with CD34(+) cell values determined in their bone marrow (BM). Strikingly, no correlation between these parameters was observed, although good correlations were obtained when numbers of colony-forming cells (CFCs) were considered. Based on these results, and because purified FA CD34(+) cells might have suboptimal repopulating properties, we investigated the possibility of genetically correcting unselected BM samples from FA patients. Our data show that the lentiviral transduction of unselected FA BM cells mediates an efficient phenotypic correction of hematopoietic progenitor cells and also of CD34(-) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), with a reported role in hematopoietic engraftment. Our results suggest that gene therapy protocols appropriate for the treatment of different monogenic diseases may not be adequate for stem cell diseases like FA.

Stem cells can theoretically divide to other cells without limit as long as a person is still alive. The stem cells that form blood and immune cells are known as hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells can be acquired from a Fanconi anemia patient, whereas genomic DNA can be obtained easily from blood cells of a normal person. Normal genes also can be synthesised by PCR method. Normal genomic DNA will be delivered into a patient's stem cells via microinjection or transfection after enzyme digestion; the defective genes might be repaired by homologous genetic recombination. The gene-corrected stem cells can be transplanted into the same patient finally. It is possible that human genomic DNA to be considered as materials for homologous genetic recombination to repair defective genes in vivo. This might be an efficient method for gene therapy, which has no or less immunological rejection for Fanconi anemia and some genetic diseases. Several related observations and experiments are discussed to support this possible means of stem cell gene therapy of Fanconi anemia.",M2
19270262,"Ectopic HOXB4 overcomes the inhibitory effect of tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} on Fanconi anemia hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Ectopic delivery of HOXB4 elicits the expansion of engrafting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We hypothesized that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling may be central to the self-renewal signature of HOXB4. Because HSCs derived from Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) knockout mice are hypersensitive to TNF-alpha, we studied Fancc(-/-) HSCs to determine the physiologic effects of HOXB4 on TNF-alpha sensitivity and the relationship of these effects to the engraftment defect of FA HSCs. Overexpression of HOXB4 reversed the in vitro hypersensitivity to TNF-alpha of Fancc(-/-) HSCs and progenitors (P) and partially rescued the engraftment defect of these cells. Coexpression of HOXB4 and the correcting FA-C protein resulted in full correction compared with wild-type (WT) HSCs. Ectopic expression of HOXB4 resulted in a reduction in both apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in Fancc(-/-) but not WT HSC/P. HOXB4 overexpression was also associated with a significant reduction in surface expression of TNF-alpha receptors on Fancc(-/-) HSC/P. Finally, enhanced engraftment was seen even when HOXB4 was expressed in a time-limited fashion during in vivo reconstitution. Thus, the HOXB4 engraftment signature may be related to its effects on TNF-alpha signaling, and this pathway may be a molecular target for timed pharmacologic manipulation of HSC during reconstitution.",M2

19252672,"DNA damage in leukocytes from Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) patients and heterozygotes induced by mitomycin C and ionizing radiation as assessed by the comet and comet-FISH assay.BACKGROUND: Lymphocytes of Fanconi anemia (FA) show an increased sensitivity to the alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), but their responses to gamma-irradiation is controversial. The extent of DNA damage in leukocytes of FA patients following irradiation and MMC treatment was studied at cellular and single chromosome level. METHODS: DNA damage induced by gamma-rays and MMC was measured in leukocytes of FA patients and carriers at whole genome level using the comet assay. Also, at the DNA level of specific chromosome involved in this disease using a modified comet-FISH protocol with whole chromosome painting probes (chromosomes 16 and 13), DNA damage in leukocytes of FA patients and heterozygotes were compared to healthy individuals. RESULTS: Baseline DNA damage in leukocytes of patients and heterozygotes was higher than in controls. Net induced DNA damage by gamma-rays in leukocytes of FA cases was not significantly different from that of healthy donors and heterozygotes. Net induced DNA damage by MMC was statistically higher and significantly different (P&lt;0.05) in patients than other groups. Hybridization of chromosome 16 reveals more signals in the tail but the number of spots in the tail was not significantly higher than the hybridization spots for chromosome 13 in both gamma-irradiated and MMC treated samples. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that DNA damage induced by MMC could be a better index for diagnosis of FA patients compared to gamma-rays. Results of comet-FISH showed no difference between the sensitivity of chromosome 16 and 13 to MMC and radiation. It may indicate that, although the FA-A gene is located on chromosome 16, this chromosome might have a similar sensitivity as other chromosomes.",M2

In order to further demonstrate the importance of the role that alphaIISp plays in normal human cells and in the repair defect in FA, alphaIISp was knocked down in normal cells using siRNA. Depletion of alphaIISp in normal cells by siRNA resulted in chromosomal instability and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents. An increased number of chromosomal aberrations were observed and, following treatment with a DNA interstrand cross-linking agent, mitomycin C, cells showed decreased cell growth and survival and decreased formation of damage-induced alphaIISp and XPF nuclear foci. Thus depletion of alphaIISp in normal cells leads to a number of defects observed in FA cells, such as chromosome instability and a deficiency in cross-link repair.",M2

The FA pathway regulates the repair of DNA crosslinks. A critical step in this pathway is the monoubiquitination and deubiquitination of FANCD2. Deubiquitination of FANCD2 is mediated by the ubiquitin protease, USP1. Here, we demonstrate that targeted deletion of mouse Usp1 results in elevated perinatal lethality, male infertility, crosslinker hypersensitivity, and an FA phenotype. Usp1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts had heightened levels of monoubiquitinated Fancd2 in chromatin. Usp1(-/-) cells exhibited impaired Fancd2 foci assembly and a defect in homologous recombination repair. Double knockout of Usp1 and Fancd2 resulted in a more severe phenotype than either single knockout. Our results indicate that mouse Usp1 functions downstream in the FA pathway. Deubiquitination is a critical event required for Fancd2 nuclear foci assembly, release from chromatin, and function in DNA repair.",M2

Short tandem repeat polymerase chain reaction (STR-PCR) was used to stratify patients into five groups: (A) complete donor chimeras (n = 39), (B) transient mixed chimeras (n = 15) (C) stable mixed chimeras (n = 18), (D) progressive mixed chimeras (n = 14) (E) recipient chimeras with early graft rejection (n = 5). As serial sampling was not possible in Group E, serial chimerism results for 86 patients were available for analysis. The following factors were analysed for association with chimeric status: age, sex match, donor type, aetiology of aplasia, source of stem cells, number of cells engrafted, conditioning regimen, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, occurrence of acute and chronic GvHD and survival. Progressive mixed chimeras (PMCs) were at high risk of late graft rejection (n = 10, P &lt; 0.0001). Seven of these patients lost their graft during withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. STR-PCR indicated an inverse correlation between detection of recipient cells post-SCT and occurrence of acute GvHD (P = 0.008). PMC was a bad prognostic indicator of survival (P = 0.003). Monitoring of chimeric status during cyclosporin withdrawal may facilitate therapeutic intervention to prevent late graft rejection in patients transplanted for SAA.",M2

In this report, we describe a multi-center pilot study of five consecutive FA patients with high-risk features for transplant prepared with fludarabine, without radiation. Four patients engrafted quickly, experienced minimal toxicity and are well at 43-65 months post-transplant. One patient had a C-mismatched unrelated donor transplant and had unsustained engraftment. This fludarabine based regimen without radiation was safe and effective for four high-risk patients, suggesting that eliminating radiation should be further studied as an approach to HSCT in children with FA.",M2
19131774,"Significance of fetal hemoglobin values in detection of heterozygotes in fanconi anemia: reevaluation of fetal hemoglobin values by a sensitive method.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a genetically very heterogeneous disease making routine detection of carriers quite difficult by molecular analysis. Finding alternative method has vital importance especially in populations where prevalence of the disease is quite high because of consanguineous marriages. The aim of this study was to find a considerably reliable parameter to detect FA carriers by methods other than molecular analysis. The subjects of this study were 66 parents of children with FA and 40 age and sex compatible individuals from the normal healthy population. An index family with a known mutation was also included as an evidence for verification of the results. The mean fetal hemoglobin (HbF) values (0.81%+/-0.72%) of FA heterozygotes studied by high-performance liquid chromatography was significantly higher than that (0.37%+/-0.32%) of the control group (P&lt;0.001). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the HbF value of the children (mean: 4.50+/-1.59) and the parents (mean: 0.81+/-0.72) (r: 0.698, P=0.01). No significant difference was detected between the hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet counts of the study and control groups. The results of this study suggest that the HbF values may be used as a marker to predict carriers in the family members of a child with FA when definitive diagnosis by molecular analysis is not possible.",M2
19109555,"ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCA on serine 1449 after DNA damage is important for <e>FA</e> pathway function.Previous work has shown several proteins defective in Fanconi anemia (FA) are phosphorylated in a functionally critical manner. FANCA is phosphorylated after DNA damage and localized to chromatin, but the site and significance of this phosphorylation are unknown. Mass spectrometry of FANCA revealed one phosphopeptide, phosphorylated on serine 1449. Serine 1449 phosphorylation was induced after DNA damage but not during S phase, in contrast to other posttranslational modifications of FA proteins. Furthermore, the S1449A mutant failed to completely correct a variety of FA-associated phenotypes. The DNA damage response is coordinated by phosphorylation events initiated by apical kinases ATM (ataxia telangectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and ATR is essential for proper FA pathway function. Serine 1449 is in a consensus ATM/ATR site, phosphorylation in vivo is dependent on ATR, and ATR phosphorylated FANCA on serine 1449 in vitro. Phosphorylation of FANCA on serine 1449 is a DNA damage-specific event that is downstream of ATR and is functionally important in the FA pathway.",M2
19101576,"The Fanconi anemia protein interaction network: casting a wide net.It has long been hypothesized that a defect in the repair of damaged DNA is central to the etiology of Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). Indeed, an increased sensitivity of FA patient-derived cells to the lethal effects of various forms of DNA damaging agents was described over three decades ago [A.J. Fornace, Jr., J.B. Little, R.R. Weichselbaum, DNA repair in a Fanconi's anemia fibroblast cell strain, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 561 (1979) 99-109; Y. Fujiwara, M. Tatsumi, Repair of mitomycin C damage to DNA in mammalian cells and its impairment in Fanconi's anemia cells, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 66 (1975) 592-598; A.J. Rainbow, M. Howes, Defective repair of ultraviolet- and gamma-ray-damaged DNA in Fanconi's anaemia, Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 31 (1977) 191-195]. Furthermore, the cytological hallmark of FA, the DNA crosslink-induced radial chromosome formation, exemplifies an innate impairment in the repair of these particularly cytotoxic DNA lesions [A.D. Auerbach, Fanconi anemia diagnosis and the diepoxybutane (DEB) test, Exp. Hematol. 21 (1993) 731-733]. Precisely defining the collective role of the FA proteins in DNA repair, however, continues to be one of the most enigmatic and challenging questions in the FA field. The first six identified FA proteins (A, C, E, F, G, and D2) harbored no recognizable enzymatic features, precluding association with a specific metabolic process. Consequently, our knowledge of the role of the FA proteins in the DNA damage response has been gleaned primarily through biochemical association studies with non-FA proteins. Here, we provide a chronological discourse of the major FA protein interaction network discoveries, with particular emphasis on the DNA damage response, that have defined our current understanding of the molecular basis of FA.",M2
19101574,"The Fanconi anemia/BRCA gene network in zebrafish: embryonic expression and comparative genomics.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins to repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression was broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and hematopoietic tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were expressed specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for fin/limb development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA patients. Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium, a site of squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish expressed fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related to microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in specific stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to DNA repair during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in human patients. The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in proliferative zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement of fanc genes in single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish embryos and adults in proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA patients. These results support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive experimental system to help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also to breast cancer, given the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and fancd1 (brca2) in both conditions.",M2
19086307,"Audiologic abnormalities of Fanconi anaemia.CONCLUSIONS: The most common audiologic manifestation in Fanconi anaemia (<e>FA</e>) was asymmetrical bilateral conductive hearing loss that was more severe at lower frequencies and in some cases had a progressive character. The routine screening of all patients diagnosed with FA allowed the recognition of mild hearing loss and the prevention of the deleterious effects of its progression with adequate rehabilitation measures. OBJECTIVES: FA is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by bone marrow failure, multiple congenital anomalies and increased susceptibility to malignancy. Otologic manifestations in FA include morphologic anomalies affecting the ear structures and hearing loss. This report is a retrospective review of the most important features, including audiologic features, in children with FA attending a paediatric hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of eight patients with FA were reviewed and patient demographics, physical abnormalities, haematological characteristics at diagnosis and otological and audiological features were analysed. RESULTS: Eight patients (five females, three males), aged between 3 and 13 years old, have been followed for at least 1 year in our hospital. In all, 50% (four of eight) of our population has hearing loss. It is an asymmetrical, bilateral, conductive hearing loss that is more severe at lower frequencies. Two patients (25%) have unilateral type I microtia and stenotic external ear canal.",M2
19065770,"Flow cytometry for diepoxybutane test analysis.The main feature of Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is the high sensitivity of the cells to the clastogenic agent, diepoxybutane (DEB). Thus, differential diagnosis of this syndrome can be made by cytogenetic analysis; adding DEB to lymphocytes in culture (DEB test) increases the number of chromosome breaks. Fanconi anemia cells have an abnormal cell cycle, with an increased frequency of cells arrested at G2. In order to determine if flow cytometry can be utilized for FA diagnosis, we cultivated lymphocytes with DEB and analyzed them for G2 accumulation. Lymphocytes cultivated for 72 h were labeled with CD3 antibody and propidium iodide for analysis of the cells in the G2 phase. Cultures of lymphocytes from two FA patients who were diagnosed by the DEB test and six control individuals with a negative DEB test had 55.26% (SD +/- 6.97) and 2.81% (SD +/- 0.22) cells arrested at G2, respectively. We conclude that flow-cytometry analysis of cells exposed to DEB can be useful for FA diagnosis.",M2
19061902,"The genetic and molecular basis of Fanconi anemia.The capacity to maintain genomic integrity is shared by all living organisms. Multiple pathways are distinguished that safeguard genomic stability, most of which have originated in primitive life forms. In human individuals, defects in these pathways are typically associated with cancer proneness. The Fanconi anemia pathway, one of these pathways, has evolved relatively late during evolution and exists - in its fully developed form - only in vertebrates. This pathway, in which thus far 13 distinct proteins have been shown to participate, appears essential for error-free DNA replication. Inactivating mutations in the corresponding genes underlie the recessive disease Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>). In the last decade the genetic basis of this disorder has been uncovered by a variety of approaches, including complementation cloning, genetic linkage analysis and protein association studies. Here we review these approaches, introduce the encoded proteins, and discuss their possible role in ensuring genomic integrity.",M2
19059419,"C. elegans: a model of Fanconi anemia and ICL repair.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a severe recessive disorder with a wide range of clinical manifestations [M. Levitus, H. Joenje, J.P. de Winter, The Fanconi anemia pathway of genomic maintenance, Cell Oncol. 28 (2006) 3-29]. In humans, 13 complementation groups have been identified to underlie FA: A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, and N [W. Wang, Emergence of a DNA-damage response network consisting of Fanconi anaemia and BRCA proteins, Nat. Rev. Genet. 8 (2007) 735-748]. Cells defective for any of these genes display chromosomal aberrations and sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). It has therefore been suggested that the 13 FA proteins constitute a pathway for the repair of ICLs, and that a deficiency in this repair process causes genomic instability leading to the different clinical phenotypes. However, the exact nature of this repair pathway, or even whether all 13 FA proteins are involved at some stage of a linear repair process, remains to be defined. Undoubtedly, the recent identification and characterisation of FA homologues in model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, will help facilitate an understanding of the function of the FA proteins by providing new analytical tools. To date, sequence homologues of five FA genes have been identified in C. elegans. Three of these homologues have been confirmed: brc-2 (FANCD1/BRCA2), fcd-2 (FANCD2), and dog-1 (FANCJ/BRIP1); and two remain to be characterised: W02D3.10 (FANCI) and drh-3 (FANCM). Here we review how the nematode can be used to study FA-associated DNA repair, focusing on what is known about the ICL repair genes in C. elegans and which important questions remain for the field.",M2
19048618,"A novel cell-free screen identifies a potent inhibitor of the Fanconi anemia pathway.The Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) DNA damage response pathway is involved in the processing of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). As such, inhibition of the FA pathway could chemosensitize FA-competent tumor cells to commonly used ICL agents like cisplatin. Moreover, suppression of the FA pathway is synthetic lethal with deficiencies in several other DNA repair pathways, suggesting that FA pathway inhibitors could be used in targeted therapies against specific tumors. To identify such inhibitors, we designed a novel in vitro screening assay utilizing Xenopus egg extracts. Using the DNA-stimulated monoubiquitylation of Xenopus FANCD2 (xFANCD2-L) as readout, a chemical library screen identified DDN (2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) as a novel and potent FA pathway inhibitor. DDN inhibited xFANCD2-L formation in a dose-dependent manner in both extracts and human cells without disruption of the upstream FA core complex. DDN also inhibited the characteristic subnuclear FANCD2 foci formation following DNA damage. Moreover, DDN displayed a greater synergistic effect with cisplatin in a FA-proficient cancer cell line compared to its FA-deficient isogenic counterpart, suggesting that DDN might be a good lead candidate as cisplatin chemosensitizer in both FA-deficient and FA-competent tumors. This system constitutes the first cell-free screening assay for identifying compounds that inhibit the FA pathway and provides a new biochemical platform for mapping the functions of its various components with specific chemical inhibitors.",M2

It is not clear whether the FA proteins function in oxidative DNA damage and oncogenic stress response. Here, we report that deficiency in the Fanca gene in mice elicits a p53-dependent growth arrest and DNA damage response to oxidative DNA damage and oncogenic stress. Using a Fanca-/-Trp53-/- double knockout model and a functionally switchable p53 retrovirus, we define the kinetics, dependence, and persistence of p53-mediated response to oxidative and oncogenic stresses in Fanca-/- cells. Notably, oxidative stress induces persistent p53 response in Fanca-/- cells, likely due to accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. On the other hand, whereas wild-type cells exhibit prolonged response to oncogene activation, the p53-activating signals induced by oncogenic ras are short-lived in Fanca-/- cells, suggesting that Fanca may be required for the cell to engage p53 during constitutive ras activation. We propose that the FA proteins protect cells from stress-induced proliferative arrest and tumor evolution by acting as a modulator of the signaling pathways that link FA to p53.",M2

FA patients present spontaneous and induced chromosome breakage. Hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) represents the unique therapeutic option to restore normal hematopoiesis when marrow failure or clonal hematopoietic abnormality occurs. Conventional myeloablative conditioning regimen, especially including a high dose of irradiation, appeared strongly toxic for FA patients. Then, reduced-intensity conditioning regimens were developed successfully for those patients. However, TRM still remained higher than for other HSCT indications. The development of fludarabine containing a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen appears to be a major progress. Long-term follow-up is absolutely necessary.",M2

Previous studies of Fanconi anemia SCCs, mainly from US patients, revealed the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in 21 (84%) of 25 tumors analyzed. We examined a panel of 21 SCCs mainly from European Fanconi anemia patients (n = 19 <e>FA</e> patients; 16 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [HNSCCs], 2 esophageal SCCs, and 3 anogenital SCCs) for their clinical and molecular characteristics, including patterns of allelic loss, TP53 mutations, and the presence of HPV DNA by GP5+/6+ polymerase chain reaction. HPV DNA was detected in only two (10%) of 21 tumors (both anogenital SCCs) but in none of the 16 HNSCCs. Of the 18 tumors analyzed, 10 contained a TP53 mutation. The patterns of allelic loss were comparable to those generally found in sporadic SCCs. Our data show that HPV does not play a major role in squamous cell carcinogenesis in this cohort of Fanconi anemia patients and that the Fanconi anemia SCCs are genetically similar to sporadic SCCs despite having a different etiology.",M2

18995830,"FANCM and FAAP24 function in ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling independently of the Fanconi anemia core complex.The Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) pathway is implicated in DNA repair and cancer predisposition. Central to this pathway is the FA core complex, which is targeted to chromatin by FANCM and FAAP24 following replication stress. Here we show that FANCM and FAAP24 interact with the checkpoint protein HCLK2 independently of the FA core complex. In addition to defects in FA pathway activation, downregulation of FANCM or FAAP24 also compromises ATR/Chk1-mediated checkpoint signaling, leading to defective Chk1, p53, and FANCE phosphorylation; 53BP1 focus formation; and Cdc25A degradation. As a result, FANCM and FAAP24 deficiency results in increased endogenous DNA damage and a failure to efficiently invoke cell-cycle checkpoint responses. Moreover, we find that the DNA translocase activity of FANCM, which is dispensable for FA pathway activation, is required for its role in ATR/Chk1 signaling. Our data suggest that DNA damage recognition and remodeling activities of FANCM and FAAP24 cooperate with ATR/Chk1 to promote efficient activation of DNA damage checkpoints.",M2
18995829,"Chromatin recruitment of DNA repair proteins: lessons from the fanconi anemia and double-strand break repair pathways.In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells must rapidly load DNA repair proteins onto damaged chromatin. Chromatin recruitment often entails ubiquitination of a damage-specific DNA repair protein, interaction with a ubiquitin binding factor, assembly of a multisubunit DNA repair complex, and eventually a deubiquitination event once the DNA repair reaction has been completed. This review focuses on the recent discoveries in the Fanconi Anemia (<e>FA</e>) and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, which underscore the importance of regulated chromatin loading in the DNA damage response. Interestingly, these two pathways share several features, suggesting a more general mechanism for DNA-repair regulation.",M2

Intriguingly, the core complex component FANCM also catalyzes branch migration of model Holliday junctions and replication forks in vitro. Here we have characterized the ortholog of FANCM in fission yeast Fml1 in order to understand the physiological significance of this activity. We show that Fml1 has at least two roles in homologous recombination-it promotes Rad51-dependent gene conversion at stalled/blocked replication forks and limits crossing over during mitotic double-strand break repair. In vitro Fml1 catalyzes both replication fork reversal and D loop disruption, indicating possible mechanisms by which it can fulfill its pro- and antirecombinogenic roles.",M2

METHODS:Nineteen cell lines derived from diverse subtypes of lymphoma for possible FA pathway defects were screened. RESULTS: No defect in FANCD2 ubiquitination was observed. However, the FANCN protein was absent in cell lines HT and Sudhl4. This absence was correlated with enhanced MMC-induced G2 arrest, growth inhibition and high chromosomal breakage rate in both cell lines. In addition, in exon-5a of FANCN gene, a mutation of c.1769 C&gt;T, p. A590V was found in cell line HT, but not in cell line Sudhl4.

18836100,"DNA damage and repair of leukocytes from Fanconi anaemia patients, carriers and healthy individuals as measured by the alkaline comet assay.Fanconi anaemia (<e>FA</e>) patients show cellular sensitivity to a variety of clastogens and prominently to cross-linking agents. Although there is a long-standing clinical impression of radiosensitivity, in vitro studies have yielded conflicting results. In this study, initial radiation-induced DNA damage and kinetics of DNA repair in (60)Co gamma-irradiated leukocytes from healthy volunteers, FA patients and heterozygotes were assessed using alkaline comet assay. Results showed higher levels of baseline DNA damage in leukocytes of patients and heterozygotes than in controls. Gamma-ray-induced initial DNA damage in leukocytes of FA cases was not significantly different from that of healthy donors and heterozygotes. However, after a repair time of 4 h, following irradiation, samples from the healthy individuals and carriers showed less residual DNA damage in their leukocytes, whereas FA patients revealed more DNA damages than their baseline. Although similar initial induced DNA damage was observed for all groups, the repair kinetics of radiation-induced DNA damage of leukocytes from FA patients was statistically different from healthy and carrier subjects. These findings may suggest that hypersensitivity of FA cells to cross-linking and clastogenic agents might be due to inefficient and delayed repair machinery of these cells. Also, the amount of residual DNA damage after irradiation could be used as a putative predictor of FA screening and cellular radiosensitivity.",M2
18831513,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 13 patients with Fanconi anemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a chromosomal instability disorder with a very high risk of developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), most notably after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: In the current study, the authors reported 13 cases of HNSCC in FA patients who underwent HSCT at the Saint Louis Hospital between 1976 and 2007. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at time of HSCT was 9.7 years. All patients received irradiation-based conditioning before HSCT and all developed extensive chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). HNSCC was diagnosed at a median interval of 10 years after HSCT, mainly in numerous sites within the oral cavity (11 patients). Lymph node involvement was diagnosed in 4 patients. The TNM classification was: T1 in 6 patients, T2 in 2 patients, T3 in 2 patients, and T4 in 3 patients. Treatment was comprised of surgery in 10 patients, with clear surgical margins reported in 7 (including cervical lymph node dissection in 6 patients). Surgery was performed in addition to other treatments in only 2 patients (radiotherapy or cryotherapy). For the remaining 3 patients, treatment consisted in radiotherapy (2 patients) or chemotherapy (1 patient). Disease progression while receiving therapy was observed in 5 patients and 5 other patients developed disease recurrence between 3.5 and 23.7 months after treatment. Death occurred in 11 patients. At the time of last follow-up, only 2 patients were alive without any disease between 9 and 23 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: HNSCC developing in FA patients after HSCT is associated with a very poor prognosis. A systematic surveillance of the oral cavity is essential to permit early surgery, which to the authors' knowledge remains the only curative treatment for a minority of patients. It is very important to attempt to prevent this cancer by reducing chronic GVHD and using conditioning without irradiation.",M2
18812474,"In vivo proliferation advantage of genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia <e>FA</e>-D1.Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited recessive DNA repair disorder mainly characterized by bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Studies in mosaic FA patients have shown that reversion of one inherited germ-line mutation resulting in a functional allele in one or a few hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can lead to the proliferation advantage of corrected cells, thus over time normalizing the hematologic status of the patient. In contrast to these observations, it is still unclear whether ex vivo genetic correction of FA HSCs also provides a similar proliferation advantage to FA HSCs. Using an FA mouse model with a marked hematopoietic phenotype, the FA-D1 (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27)) mice, we demonstrate that the lentivirus-mediated gene therapy of FA HSCs results in the progressive expansion of genetically corrected clones in mild-conditioned FA-D1 recipients. Consistent with these data, hematopoietic progenitors from FA recipients progressively became mitomycin C resistant and their chromosomal instability was reverted. No evidence of myelodysplasia, leukemias, or abnormal clonal repopulation was observed at multiple time points in primary or secondary recipients. Our results demonstrate that ectopic expression of BRCA2 confers a beneficial in vivo proliferation advantage to FA-D1 HSCs that enables the full hematopoietic repopulation of FA recipients with genetically corrected cells.",M2

The conditioning regimen varied according to time of SCT and disease status at SCT; 22 patients (group A) received Cy 20 mg/kg, thoraco-abdominal radiation and antithymocyte globulins (ATG); and 34 patients (group B) received Cy 60 mg/kg and ATG. Median time to engraftment was similar (14 days) in both groups. Hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly more common in group B. Overall survival and event-free survival of all patients were 85 and 78.3% respectively. For groups A and B respectively, overall survival was 72.5 and 96.9% (P=0.013); and event-free survival was 72.5 and 82.3% (P=0.3).

In an attempt to decrease the risk and severity of regimen-related toxicities, nonirradiation regimens have been explored. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes after irradiation and nonirradiation regimens in 148 FA patients and identify risk factors impacting upon HCT outcomes. Hematopoietic recovery, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD, GVHD), and mortality were similar after irradiation and nonirradiation regimens. In both groups of recipients aged &gt;10 years, prior use of androgens and cytomegalovirus seropositivity in either the donor or recipient were associated with higher mortality. With median follow-ups &gt;5 years, the 5-year probability of overall survival, adjusted for factors impacting overall mortality was 78% and 81% after irradiation and nonirradiation regimens, P = .61. In view of the high risk of cancer and other radiation-related effects on growth and development, these results support the use of nonirradiation preparatory regimens. As the peak time for developing solid tumors after HCT is 8 to 9 years, longer follow-up is required before definitive statements can be made regarding the impact of nonirradiation regimens on cancer risk.",M2

We have evaluated the effect of amifostine (AMF) on basal and mitomycin C (MMC)-induced chromosomal breakage in FA blood cells using the micronucleus assay. The basal micronuclei count was higher among FA patients than healthy subjects. Pre-treatment with AMF significantly inhibited micronucleation induced by MMC in healthy subjects (23.4 +/- 4.0 - MMC vs 12.3 2.9 - AMF --&gt; MMC) MN/1000CB, p &lt; 0.01, one way ANOVA) as well as in FA patients (80.0 +/- 5.8 - MMC vs 40.1 +/- 5.8 - AMF --&gt; MMC) MN/1000CB, p &lt; 0.01, ANOVA). Release of ROS by peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with AMF -&gt; MMC and measured by chemoluminometry showed that AMF-protection was statistically higher among FA patients than in healthy individuals. Based on these results we suggest that AMF prevents chromosomal breakage induced by MMC, probably by its antioxidant effect.",M2
18786657,"Fanconi anemia proteins stabilize replication forks.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a recessive genetic disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to crosslinking agents that has been attributed to defects in DNA repair and/or replication. FANCD2 and the FA core complex bind to chromatin during DNA replication; however, the role of FA proteins during replication is unknown. Using Xenopus cell-free extracts, we show that FANCL depletion results in defective DNA replication restart following treatment with camptothecin, a drug that results in DSBs during DNA replication. This defect is more pronounced following treatment with mitomycin C, presumably because of an additional role of the FA pathway in DNA crosslink repair. Moreover, we show that chromatin binding of FA core complex proteins during DNA replication follows origin assembly and origin firing and is dependent on the binding of RPA to ssDNA while FANCD2 additionally requires ATR, consistent with FA proteins acting at replication forks. Together, our data suggest that FA proteins play a role in replication restart at collapsed replication forks.",M2
18786261,"Cancer incidence in relatives of British Fanconi Anaemia patients.BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is an autosomal recessive DNA repair disorder with affected individuals having a high risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia and certain solid tumours. Thirteen complementation groups have been identified and the genes for all of these are known (FANCA, B, C, D1/BRCA2, D2, E, F, G, I, J/BRIP1, L, M and N/PALB2). Previous studies of cancer incidence in relatives of Fanconi anemia cases have produced conflicting results. A study of British FA families was therefore carried out to investigate this question, since increases in cancer risk in FA heterozygotes would have implications for counselling FA family members, and possibly also for the implementation of preventative screening measures in FA heterozygotes. METHODS: Thirty-six families took part and data was collected on 575 individuals (276 males, 299 females), representing 18,136 person years. In this cohort, 25 males and 30 females were reported with cancer under the age of 85 years, and 36 cancers (65%) could be confirmed from death certificates, cancer registries or clinical records. RESULTS: A total of 55 cancers were reported in the FA families compared to an estimated incidence of 56.95 in a comparable general population cohort, and the relative risk of cancer was 0.97 (95% C.I. = 0.71-1.23, p = 0.62) for FA family members. Analysis of relative risk for individual cancer types in each carrier probability group did not reveal any significant differences with the possible exception of prostate cancer (RR = 3.089 (95% C.I. = 1.09 - 8.78; Chi2 = 4.767, p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: This study has not shown a significant difference in overall cancer risk in FA families.",M2
18771529,"Impaired removal of DNA interstrand cross-link in Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Fanconi anemia, but not in BRCA-defective group.Human diseases characterized by a high sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL) and predisposition to malignance include Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>), which is further classified to three groups: (1) FA core-complex group; (2) FA-ID complex group; and (3) breast cancer (BRCA)-defective group. The relationships between these four groups and the basic defect in ICL repair remain unclear. To study the details of ICL repair in NBS and FA, a highly sensitive PPB (psoralen-polyethylene oxide-biotin) dot blot assay was developed to provide sensitive quantitative measurements of ICL during the removal process. Studies utilizing this assay demonstrated a decreased rate of ICL removal in cells belonging to the FA core-complex group (e.g. groups A and G) and FA-ID complex group (group D2), while ICL removal was restored to normal levels after these cells were complemented with wt-FANCA, wt-FANCG and wt-FANCD2. Conversely, FA-D1 cells with a defective BRCA2 protein displayed normal ICL removal, although they were compromised with respect to recombination. This normal ICL removal rate in recombination-deficient cells was confirmed by using XRCC3-defective Chinese hamster cells, which are similarly compromised with respect to recombination and are sensitive to mitomycin C. The present study also showed that cells from patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome were defective in ICL removal, while they were impaired in the recombination. These results indicate an obvious defect of FA and NBS in the ICL repair process, except in the BRCA-defective group, and a separate step of recombination-mediated repair pathway between the BRCA group and NBS.",M2
18724063,"Fanconi anemia: causes and consequences of genetic instability.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare recessive disease that reflects the cellular and phenotypic consequences of genetic instability: growth retardation, congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, high risk of neoplasia, and premature aging. At the cellular level, manifestations of genetic instability include chromosomal breakage, cell cycle disturbance, and increased somatic mutation rates. FA cells are exquisitely sensitive towards oxygen and alkylating drugs such as mitomycin C or diepoxybutane, pointing to a function of FA genes in the defense against reactive oxygen species and other DNA damaging agents. FA is caused by biallelic mutations in at least 12 different genes which appear to function in the maintenance of genomic stability. Eight of the FA proteins form a nuclear core complex with a catalytic function involving ubiquitination of the central FANCD2 protein. The posttranslational modification of FANCD2 promotes its accumulation in nuclear foci, together with known DNA maintenance proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and the RAD51 recombinase. Biallelic mutations in BRCA2 cause a severe FA-like phenotype, as do biallelic mutations in FANCD2. In fact, only leaky or hypomorphic mutations in this central group of FA genes appear to be compatible with life birth and survival. The newly discovered FANCJ (= BRIP1) and FANCM (= Hef ) genes correspond to known DNA-maintenance genes (helicase resp. helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA). These genes provide the most convincing evidence to date of a direct involvement of FA genes in DNA repair functions associated with the resolution of DNA crosslinks and stalled replication forks. Even though genetic instability caused by mutational inactivation of the FANC genes has detrimental effects for the majority of FA patients, around 20% of patients appear to benefit from genetic instability since genetic instability also increases the chance of somatic reversion of their constitutional mutations. Intragenic crossover, gene conversion, back mutation and compensating mutations in cis have all been observed in revertant, and, consequently, mosaic FA-patients, leading to improved bone marrow function. There probably is no other experiment of nature in our species in which causes and consequences of genetic instability, including the role of reactive oxygen species, can be better documented and explored than in FA.",M2
18716735,"Correlation of thyroid and growth hormones to chromosomal instability in Egyptian Fanconi anemia patients.OBJECTIVE: Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare inherited genomic instability syndrome and usually associated with endocrine dysfunctions. We aimed to assess the diagnostic standards of chromosomal instability in FA and to correlate the breakage frequency with the severity of endocrinal dysfunctions. METHODS: Twenty seven FA patients were randomly selected from Hematology Unit of Mansoura University Children's Hospital; their mean age 8.8 yr. Sixteen normal children matched for age and sex were used as controls. Cytogenetic studies included peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures using phytohemagglutinin to obtain chromosomal spreads. Chromosomal breakage was induced by (i) Diepoxybutane 0.1 mug/ml. (ii) Mitomycin C 0.1 microg/ml. (iii) Irradiation of cultures to four radiation doses; 75, 150, 300 and 400 rads (rad1, rad2, rad3 and rad4 respectively). Chromosomal aberrations were scored from the previous 6 cultures besides a culture for spontaneous chromosomal breakage; then mean chromosomal breakage was calculated for the seven cultures. Endocrinal evaluation included quantitative determination of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and tetraiodothyronine (T4), serum growth hormone (GH), insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin levels. RESULTS: Chromosomal breakage was found to be significantly higher in patients than control when induced by Diepoxybutane (p = 0.003), Mitomycin (p = 0.001), rad3 (p = 0.043) and rad4 (p = 0.001). Mean chromosomal breakage was significantly negative correlated to head circumference (r = -0.57) and GH level (r = -0.50), with no significant correlation to other hormonal parameters. Mitomycin and rad4 were found more accurate than DEB test for diagnosis of FA in suspected cases. CONCLUSION: Correction of the frequently associated hormonal dysfunction (reduced GH and T4) should be considered in the treatment discipline of FA patients to improve their final height.",M2
18684868,"Overnight transduction with foamyviral vectors restores the long-term repopulating activity of Fancc-/- stem cells.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and myeloid malignancies. Identification of 13 FA genes has been instrumental to explore gene transfer technologies aimed at correction of autologous FA-deficient stem cells. To date, 3 human FA stem cell gene therapy trials with standard 4-day transduction protocols using gammaretroviral vectors failed to provide clinical benefit. In addition, 2- to 4 day ex vivo manipulation of bone marrow from mice containing a disruption of the homologue of human FANCC (Fancc) results in a time-dependent increase in apoptosis and a risk for malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. Here, we show that a 14-hour transduction period allows a foamyviral vector construct expressing the human FANCC cDNA to efficiently transduce murine FA stem cells with 1 to 2 proviral integrations per genome. Functionally, the repopulating activity of Fancc(-/-) stem cells from reconstituted mice expressing the recombinant FANCC transgene was comparable with wild-type controls. Collectively, these data provide evidence that short-term transduction of c-kit(+) cells with a foamyviral vector is sufficient for functional correction of a stem cell phenotype in a murine FA model. These data could have implications for future gene therapy trials for FA patients.",M2
18647660,"Differential expression of TP53 associated genes in Fanconi anemia cells after mitomycin C and hydroxyurea treatment.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare, heritable chromosomal instability disease characterized by several congenital defects and cancer predisposition. Functional interactions between specific FA proteins and DNA damage response and repair activities have been reported, but the interplay between these mechanisms for maintaining genomic stability are not well understood. Many DNA damage response proteins are transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53), suggesting an important regulatory role for the DNA damage and stress response pathway. To better understand the association between FA and the DNA damage stress response we analyzed the levels of chromosomal damage and damage mediated gene transcription responses in lymphoblastoid cells derived from normal individuals and patients carrying the most common FA complementation group (FA-A). Chromosomal aberrations were first measured after exposure to mitomicyn C (MMC) or hydroxyurea (HU). Aliquots of the same cell were than assayed for the transcriptional response of 21 DNA damage and stress response genes using quantitative real-time PCR. The FA-A lymphoblastoid cells showed significant increases in the frequency of chromosome aberrations relative to non-FA-A lymphoblastoid lines after MMC treatment. The MMC induced damage was correlated with a general increase in expression of TP53-modulated DNA damage stress response genes involved in processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Following HU treatment FA cells showed a decreased induction of CAs with much less transcriptional differences between targeted genes. Overall, the differences between the normal and FA-A cells after genotoxic treatments imply an increased activation and reliance of FA cells on the down-stream activities of TP53 for prevention of cell killing and chromosome damage from interstrand crosslinks but not for general replication arrest and double strand breaks. Furthermore, these results imply a regulatory connection between the FA pathway and activation of TP53 for responding to DNA damage. Alterations in the regulation of the DNA damage response may be related to the complex phenotypes seen in FA patients.",M2
18545254,"Fanconi anaemia: new strategies.Fanconi anaemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare genetic disease characterized by chromosomal instability, somatic abnormalities, marrow failure and cancer proness. The main cause of morbidity and mortality is bone marrow failure, which typically arises in the first decade of life and progresses to full-blown transfusion dependence and severe neutropenia in a variable number of years. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML may arise on the background of marrow failure, although cases of patients diagnosed with MDS or overt leukaemia before the full appearance of marrow aplasia are reported. This article reviews the current options for treatment of bone marrow failure in FA and provides an algorithm for supporting decisions on treatment. The use of androgens, corticosteroids and growth factors is reviewed, as well as the results in recent cohorts of matched sibling donor haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants and unrelated donor HSC transplants, including cord blood graft. The conditioning regimens used are analysed and commented. Up-to-date information on second tumours after HSC transplant and on experimental treatments such as gene therapy, prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines is provided.",M2
18627348,"Oxidative stress in Fanconi anemia hematopoiesis and disease progression.Patients with the genomic instability syndrome Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) commonly develop progressive bone marrow failure and have a high risk of cancer. The prominent role of the FA protein family involves DNA damage response and/or repair. Oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defense, is considered to be an important pathogenic factor in leukemia-prone bone marrow diseases such as FA. Cellular responses inducing resistance to oxidative stress are important for cellular survival, organism lifespan, and cancer prevention, but until recently, mammalian factors regulating resistance to oxidative stress have not been well characterized. Significant evidence supports excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, induced by stresses, most significantly oxidative stress, as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure and leukemia progression in FA. In this brief review, we discuss the functional link between FA proteins and oxidative DNA damage response/repair, with emphasis on the implication of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology and abnormal hematopoiesis in FA.",M2
18623197,"Improved growth velocity during thyroid hormone therapy in children with Fanconi anemia and borderline thyroid function.BACKGROUND: Children with Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) tend to have short stature, mild thyrotropin (TSH) elevation, and borderline low free thyroxine (FT4). Objective was to examine whether thyroid hormone therapy improves linear growth in children with FA and borderline thyroid function tests PROCEDURE: Thyroid function tests were performed in 63 children with FA. Eight subjects participated in a random order, double-blind, cross-over treatment for 7 months with levothyroxine and for 7 months with placebo. Monitoring included growth measurements and laboratory assays at 1, 4 and 7 months of each phase. A 1 month lead in/wash out period was excluded from analysis of each treatment phase. RESULTS: The majority (63%) of FA children had borderline thyroid function tests. All eight FA subjects enrolled in the treatment study had FT4 in the lowest third of the normal range of 0.8-1.8 ng/dL (10.3-23.2 pmol/L) [FT4 0.9 +/- 0.1 ng/dL (mean +/- SD), range 0.8-1.2 ng/dL (10.3-15.4 pmol/L)]. TSH (optimal range 0.5-3 mU/L) was borderline elevated in six of eight subjects (4.0 +/- 1.5 mU/L, 1.9-7.3 mU/L). Growth velocity was slow at baseline and improved significantly during the thyroid phase compared to the placebo phase (2.1 +/- 1.2 cm/year vs. 5.4 +/- 1.7 cm/year, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid hormone therapy is safe and may improve linear growth velocity in children with FA who have borderline thyroid function. Subtle hypothyroidism has importance for growth in children. Whether thyroid hormone treatment improves adult height in these children remains to be elucidated.",M2
18604174,"Role of Fanconi DNA repair pathway in neural stem cell homeostasis.Defects in DNA repair pathways have been involved in collapse of early neurogenesis leading to brain development abnormalities and embryonic lethality. However, consequences of DNA repair defects in adult neural stem and progenitor cells and their potential contribution in ageing phenotype are poorly understood. The Fanconi anaemia (<e>FA</e>) pathway, which functions primarily as a DNA damage response system, has been examined in neural stem and progenitor cells during developmental and adult neurogenesis. We have shown that loss of fanca and fancg specifically provokes neural progenitor apoptosis during forebrain development, related to DNA repair defects, which persists in adulthood leading to depletion of the neural stem cell pool with ageing. In addition, neural stem cells from FA mice had a reduced capacity to self-renew in vitro. Here, we expand upon our recent work and give further data examining possible implication of oxidative stress. Therefore, FA phenotype might be interpreted as a premature ageing of stem cells, DNA damages being among the driving forces of ageing.",M2
18550849,"HES1 is a novel interactor of the Fanconi anemia core complex.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) proteins are thought to play a role in chromosome stability and repair of DNA cross-links; however, these functions may not fully explain the developmental abnormalities and bone marrow failure that are characteristic of FA individuals. Here we associate the FA proteins with the Notch1 developmental pathway through a direct protein-protein interaction between the FA core complex and the hairy enhancer of split 1 (HES1). HES1 interaction with FA core complex members is dependent on a functional FA pathway. Cells depleted of HES1 exhibit an FA-like phenotype that includes cellular hypersensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) and lack of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation. HES1 is also required for proper nuclear localization or stability of some members of the core complex. Our results suggest that HES1 is a novel interacting protein of the FA core complex.",M2
18544920,"Microarray mRNA expression analysis of Fanconi anemia fibroblasts.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) cells are generally hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, implying that mutations in the different FANC genes cause a similar DNA repair defect(s). By using a customized cDNA microarray chip for DNA repair- and cell cycle-associated genes, we identified three genes, cathepsin B (CTSB), glutaredoxin (GLRX), and polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), that were misregulated in untreated primary fibroblasts from three unrelated FA-D2 patients, compared to six controls. Quantitative real-time RT PCR was used to validate these results and to study possible molecular links between FA-D2 and other FA subtypes. GLRX was misregulated to opposite directions in a variety of different FA subtypes. Increased CTSB and decreased PLK2 expression was found in all or almost all of the analyzed complementation groups and, therefore, may be related to the defective FA pathway. Transcriptional upregulation of the CTSB proteinase appears to be a secondary phenomenon due to proliferation differences between FA and normal fibroblast cultures. In contrast, PLK2 is known to play a pivotal role in processes that are linked to FA defects and may contribute in multiple ways to the FA phenotype: PLK2 is a target gene for TP53, is likely to function as a tumor suppressor gene in hematologic neoplasia, and Plk2(-/-) mice are small because of defective embryonal development.",M2
18543739,"Oral manifestations of Fanconi's anaemia: a case report.BACKGROUND: Fanconi's anaemia (<e>FA</e>) is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and high predisposition to malignancies. The incidence of the disease is unusually high in the Afrikaner population of South Africa with calculated heterozygote prevalence being approximately 1 in 77. This report describes the oral clinical and radiological findings in a 16 year old male with FA. METHODS: Medical and dental history was noted, the oral mucosa was examined and the teeth were screened for fillings and caries. Periodontal examination consisted of: measurement of probing depths, recession, mobility of teeth, furcation involvement, plaque index and gingival index. An orthopantomograph was taken. RESULTS: There was a generalized black hyper-pigmentation on the buccal mucosa, tongue and palate. The patient had generalized gingival recession and most of the periodontal pockets were deeper than 5mm. Several teeth were mobile and the orthopantomograph showed loss of alveolar bone in the furcation areas of most posterior teeth. A diagnosis of severe generalized periodontitis associated with systemic disease was made. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Fanconi's anaemia are susceptible to severe dental and periodontal diseases.",M2
18495331,"AMD3100 synergizes with G-CSF to mobilize repopulating stem cells in Fanconi anemia knockout mice.Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder characterized by a progressive bone marrow (BM) failure and susceptibility to myeloid leukemia. Genetic correction using gene-transfer technology is one potential therapy. A major hurdle in applying this technology in FA patients is the inability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize sufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem (HSC)/progenitor cells (HPC) from the BM to the peripheral blood. Whether the low number of CD34(+) cells is a result of BM hypoplasia or an inability of G-CSF to adequately mobilize FA HSC/HPC remains incompletely understood. Here we use competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated primary and secondary recipients to show that in two murine models of FA, AMD3100 synergizes with G-CSF resulting in a mobilization of HSC, whereas G-CSF alone fails to mobilize stem cells even in the absence of hypoplasia.",M2

Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>), for example, is an inherited chromosome instability syndrome with a complex array of variable disease phenotypes including congenital malformations, hematological manifestations, and cancer. To better understand specific aspects of the genetic etiology of FA and other rare diseases with complex phenotypes, it is often necessary to reduce the dimensions of the disease phenotype information. Towards this end, we extend a novel non-parametric approach to include information about a hierarchical structure among disease phenotypes. The proposed extension increases information content of the phenotype scores obtained and, thereby, the power of genotype-phenotype relationships studies.",M2
18565850,"Defective homing is associated with altered Cdc42 activity in cells from patients with Fanconi anemia group A.Previous studies showed that Fanconi anemia (<e>FA</e>) murine stem cells have defective reconstitution after bone marrow (BM) transplantation. The mechanism underlying this defect is not known. Here, we report defective homing of FA patient BM progenitors transplanted into mouse models. Using cells from patients carrying mutations in FA complementation group A (FA-A), we show that when transplanted into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) recipient mice, FA-A BM cells exhibited impaired homing activity. FA-A cells also showed defects in both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Complementation of FA-A deficiency by reexpression of FANCA readily restored adhesion of FA-A cells. A significant decrease in the activity of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 was found associated with these defective functions in patient-derived cells, and expression of a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant was able to rescue the adhesion defect of FA-A cells. These results provide the first evidence that FA proteins influence human BM progenitor homing and adhesion via the small GTPase Cdc42-regulated signaling pathway.",M2
