20061033,"Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors inhibit expression of chemokines IP-10 and RANTES and cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in the CNS following a systemic inflammatory challenge.Evidence suggests that noradrenaline has a tonic anti-inflammatory action in the central nervous system (CNS) via its ability to inhibit expression of inflammatory mediators from glial cells. Consequently it is suggested that noradrenaline may play an endogenous neuroprotective role in CNS disorders where inflammatory events contribute to pathology. Infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain is driven by increased chemokine and cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>) expression, and is known to exacerbate neuroinflammation and thereby contribute to the disease process in a number of neurodegenerative disease states. Here we demonstrate that treatment of rats with the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) desipramine and atomoxetine, agents that increase extracellular noradrenaline in the CNS, suppressed chemokine and cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression in rat brain following a systemic challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Specifically, these agents reduced expression of the chemokines, interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10, CXCL-10) and regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, CCL-5), and the CAMs, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) in cortex and hippocampus. The inhibitory action of NRIs on chemokines and CAM expression was mimicked by in vitro exposure of cultured glial cells to noradrenaline, but not to the NRIs themselves. These data indicate that the suppressive action of NRIs on chemokine and CAM expression that occurs in vivo is due to increased noradrenaline availability at glial cells, as opposed to a direct action of the drugs on glial cells per se. These results support the theory that noradrenaline has anti-inflammatory properties, and agents that increase noradrenaline availability in vivo can play a role in combating brain inflammation by reducing expression of chemokines and CAMs; molecules that facilitate leucocyte influx into the CNS.",M1
20052625,"SVEP1 is a novel marker of activated pre-determined skeletal muscle satellite cells.In this study we explored the expression pattern of SVEP1, a novel cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>), in bona fide satellite cells and their immediate progeny. We show that SVEP1 is expressed in activated satellite cells prior to their determination to the myogenic lineage. SVEP1 was also expressed during early phases of myogenic differentiation through the initial stage of myoblast fusion and myotube formation. The expression of SVEP1 was shown by immunostaining two cell culture systems: freshly isolated myofibers and primary myoblasts. Pax7 was used to pinpoint satellite cells situated in their niche on myofibers, and activated satellite cells were determined based on BrdU incorporation (Pax7(+)/BrdU(+)cells). MyoD marked satellite cells fated to undergo myogenesis as well as proliferating and differentiating myoblasts. Differentiating myoblasts and myotubes were identified based on their sarcomeric myosin expression. We showed that SVEP1 was specifically expressed in pre-determined activated satellite cells (Pax7(+)/ BrdU(+) /MyoD(-)) accounting for about 24% of total satellite cells. On the other hand, SVEP1 expression was absent in quiescent satellite cells (Pax7(+)/BrdU(-)/MyoD(-)). Moreover, based on MyoD/sarcomeric myosin co-expression SVEP1 was shown to be expressed throughout the early phases of myogenesis up until myoblast fusion and myotube formation. A decline in SVEP1 expression occurred upon myotube maturation. We suggest SVEP1 as a potential biomarker for pre-fated satellite cells. The impact of this finding is that it may allow scrutinizing signals that affect differentiation commitment. Thus, holds a therapeutic potential for maladies that involve deregulated stem cell fate-decision.",M1
19948502,"The CEACAM1 N-terminal Ig domain mediates cis- and trans-binding and is essential for allosteric rearrangements of CEACAM1 microclusters.Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) sense the extracellular microenvironment and transmit signals to the intracellular compartment. In this investigation, we addressed the mechanism of signal generation by ectodomains of single-pass transmembrane homophilic CAMs. We analyzed the structure and homophilic interactions of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related CAM 1 (CEACAM1), which regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, morphogenesis, and microbial responses. Soluble and membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains were investigated by surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor analysis, molecular electron tomography, and chemical cross-linking. The CEACAM1 ectodomain, which is composed of four glycosylated immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, is highly flexible and participates in both antiparallel (trans) and parallel (cis) homophilic binding. Membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains form microclusters in which all four Ig domains participate. Trans-binding between the N-terminal Ig domains increases formation of CEACAM1 cis-dimers and changes CEACAM1 interactions within the microclusters. These data suggest that CEACAM1 transmembrane signaling is initiated by adhesion-regulated changes of cis-interactions that are transmitted to the inner phase of the plasma membrane.",M1
19807155,"Acteoside and 6-O-acetylacteoside downregulate cell adhesion molecules induced by IL-1beta through inhibition of ERK and JNK in human vascular endothelial cells.Acteoside, an active phenylethanoid glycoside of many medicinal plants and bitter tea, displays anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However, it is unclear whether acteoside and similar compounds may inhibit the expression of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>), which plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and inflammation. Here, we found that acteoside, isoacteoside, and 6-O-acetylacteoside inhibited IL-1beta-activated expression of intercellular CAM-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); the inhibitory potency was as follows: 6-O-acetylacteoside &gt; acteoside &gt; isoacteoside. Acteoside and 6-O-acetylacteoside also dose-dependently inhibited VCAM-1 gene promoter activity in IL-1beta-activated HUVECs. The inhibition of acteoside and 6-O-acetylacteoside on IL-1beta-activated expression of CAMs was manifested by decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results indicate that acteoside and 6-O-acetylacteoside may exert anti-inflammatory activities in vascular endothelium by inhibiting the expression of CAMs, primarily through decreased phosphorylation of ERK and JNK.",M1
19759376,"Differential associations between soluble cellular adhesion molecules and atherosclerosis in the Dallas Heart Study: a distinct role for soluble endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule.OBJECTIVE: Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a junctional-type cellular adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>) that is uniquely expressed in vascular endothelium and activated platelets and mediates neutrophil and monocyte diapedesis across the endothelium. Given its role in endothelial pathobiology, we hypothesized that soluble ESAM (sESAM) would be independently associated with atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured sESAM, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1 in 3222 subjects participating in the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) was measured by electron beam computed tomography, and abdominal aortic wall thickness (AWT), aortic plaque burden (APB), and aortic compliance (AC) by MRI. Increasing levels of sESAM were associated with all major cardiovascular risk factors as well as with inflammatory markers such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, but only weakly correlated with sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. In multivariate analyses, sESAM was independently associated with prevalent CAC (OR 1.2 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; P=0.005), AWT (P=0.035), and AC (P=0.006), but not APB (P=0.15). In contrast, no independent associations were observed between sICAM-1 or sVCAM-1 and any of the atherosclerosis phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In this first reported clinical study of sESAM in humans, sESAM levels were independently associated with CAC, AWT, and AC, whereas sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were not. These findings support a unique role of this cellular adhesion molecule in atherosclerosis and suggest the need for further exploration of sESAM as a predictive biomarker and potential mediator of atherosclerosis.",M1
19596049,"The voltage-gated Na+ channel beta3 subunit does not mediate trans homophilic cell adhesion or associate with the cell adhesion molecule contactin.Voltage-gated Na(+) channel (VGSC) beta1 and beta2 subunits are multifunctional, serving as both channel modulators and cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>). The purpose of this study was to determine whether VGSC beta3 subunits function as CAMs. The beta3 extracellular domain is highly homologous to beta1, suggesting that beta3 may also be a functional CAM. We investigated the trans homophilic cell adhesive properties of beta3, its association with the beta1-interacting CAM contactin, as well as its ability to interact with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin. Our results demonstrate that, unlike beta1, beta3 does not participate in trans homophilic cell-cell adhesion or associate with contactin. Further, beta3 does not associate with ankyrin(G) in a heterologous system. Previous studies have shown that beta3 interacts with the CAM neurofascin-186 but not with VGSC beta1. Taken together, these findings suggest that, although beta1 and beta3 exhibit similar channel modulatory properties in heterologous systems, these subunits differ with regard to their homophilic and heterophilic CAM binding profiles.",M1
19589539,"Perioperative iloprost and endothelial progenitor cells in uremic patients with severe limb ischemia undergoing peripheral revascularization.The incidence of severe limb ischemia (SLI) is high among haemodialysis (HD) patients. Limb rescue rate after surgical revascularization is relatively poor compared with patients with normal renal function. Prostanoids are an interesting category as adjuvants to revascularization. New vessel growth develops not exclusively by proliferation of endothelial cells in vascular extremities but also by cells mobilized from the bone marrow (HSC), transformed into endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contributing to both re-endothelialization and neovascularization. Basal number of HSC and EPC is significantly reduced in HD patients and correlated with a subsequent defective neovascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of perioperative treatment with iloprost in uremic patients with acute ischemia of lower limbs, undergoing surgical revascularization, on endothelial progenitor cells, hypothesizing a possible biological mechanism induced by the prostanoids. A search was also made for vascular remodeling processes through the analysis of the concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (i-<e>CAM</e>, v-CAM, e-selectin), biochemical markers of endothelial activation. Thirty HD patients with SLI undergoing peripheral revascularization were enrolled (15 were treated with iloprost and 15 with a placebo). Iloprost was administered as an intra-arterial bolus of 3000 ng over 1 to 3 min immediately after revascularization and in the same affected artery. Serum samples were taken before revascularization (T0), at 6 (T6) and 24 h (T24) after infusion to measure sICAM-1, sE-selectin, and sVCAM-1, and for quantification of HSC and EPC. Progenitors were identified by specific surface markers CD34+, CD133+ and VEGFR2+. Count was conducted using PROCOUNT performed in a TRUCOUNT tube and with a FACSort flow cytometer. Before revascularization, all patients showed a decreased number of HSC and EPC. After 6 h, HSC augmented significantly compared with T0 in both groups. The iloprost group attained a significant increase compared with the placebo group. HSC levels reduced drastically at T24. EPC augmented significantly compared with basal level after 24 h. In the iloprost group, the increase was considerable compared with the placebo group. A close negative correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient (r), was found between HSC and EPC at T24 in the iloprost group (R = 0.82 P &lt; 0.01). Adhesion molecules had increased levels at T6 and T24 in both groups. Moreover, a close positive correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient, was found between EPC and adhesion molecules in both groups but the iloprost group maintained a better statistical association. Revascularization stimulated HSC and EPC release from bone marrow but at a different time: HSC increased suddenly at 6 h and diminished to a minimal amount at T24, conversely, EPC increased significantly only at T24. Iloprost treatment was able to amplify this mechanism validating recent findings (North TE et al., [31]). Adhesion molecules as markers of endothelial activation and vascular development confirmed this tendency.",M1
19574774,"Overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule in primary, metastatic, and recurrent/chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer: implications for epithelial cell adhesion molecule-specific immunotherapy.To evaluate the potential of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>/TROP-1)-specific immunotherapy against epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs), we have analyzed the expression of Ep-CAM at RNA and protein level in patients harboring primary, metastatic, and chemotherapy-resistant/recurrent EOC. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in 168 fresh-frozen biopsies and paraffin-embedded tissues. In addition, Ep-CAM surface expression was evaluated by flow cytometry in several freshly established ovarian carcinoma cell lines derived from patients harboring tumors resistant to chemotherapy in vivo as well as in vitro. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule transcript was found significantly overexpressed in primary, metastatic, and recurrent EOC when compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelium cell lines and fresh-frozen normal ovarian tissue (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, by immunohistochemistry, Ep-CAM protein expression was found significantly higher in primary, metastatic, and recurrent EOC when compared with normal ovarian tissues. Of interest, metastatic/recurrent tumors were found to express significantly higher levels of Ep-CAM protein when compared with primary ovarian carcinomas (P &lt; 0.001). Finally, a high surface expression of Ep-CAM was found in 100% (5/5) of the chemotherapy-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell lines studied by flow cytometry. These results demonstrate high Ep-CAM overexpression in ovarian carcinoma, especially in metastatic and recurrent/chemotherapy-resistant ovarian disease. The lack of Ep-CAM expression on the chelomic epithelium in the peritoneal cavity, combined with the recent development of fully human monoclonal antibodies against this surface molecule, suggest Ep-CAM as a promising target for antibody-mediated therapies in ovarian carcinoma patients harboring tumors refractory to standard treatment modalities.",M1
19524419,"Budlein A from Viguiera robusta inhibits leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, adhesion molecule expression and inflammatory mediators release.Budlein A has been reported to exert some analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we have evaluated its effect on LPS-induced leukocyte recruitment in vivo and the mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory activity. In vivo, intravital videomicroscopy was used to determine the effects of budlein A on LPS-induced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in the murine cremasteric microcirculation. In vitro, the effects of budlein A on LPS-induced cytokine, chemokine and nitrites release, T-cell proliferative response as well as cell adhesion molecule expression (<e>CAM</e>) were evaluated. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of budlein A (2.6 mM/kg) caused a significant reduction of LPS-induced leukocyte rolling flux, adhesion and emigration by 84, 92 and 96% respectively. In vitro, T-cell proliferative response was also affected by budlein A. When murine J774 macrophages were incubated with the sesquiterpene lactone, LPS-induced IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) release were concentration-dependently inhibited. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), budlein A also reduced the production of TNF-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-8, nitrites and CAM expression elicited by LPS. Budlein A is a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced leukocyte accumulation in vivo. This effect appears to be mediated through inhibition of cytokine and chemokine release and down-regulation of CAM expression. Thus, it has potential therapeutic interest for the control of leukocyte recruitment that occurs in different inflammatory disorders.",M1
19482088,"The functional role of cell adhesion molecules in tumor angiogenesis.Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) are cell surface glycoproteins that mediate the physical interactions between adjacent cells and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. CAMs belong to different protein families, depending on their structural and functional properties. Furthermore, the expression of certain CAMs under physiological conditions is restricted to specific cell types. Besides playing a key homeostatic role in maintaining the architecture of quiescent tissues, CAMs have also to adapt to the microenvironmental changes that occur during certain physiological and pathological processes. This is best exemplified by cancer vascularization, where the expression and function of vascular CAMs are dynamically regulated in response to tissue alterations induced by tumor growth as well as by changes in the surrounding stroma. This enables endothelial cells (ECs) to leave the quiescent state and re-enter the angiogenic cascade. The latter is a multistep process carried out by different types of specialized ECs. This review describes the actual or supposed function of the various CAM subsets in the sequential series of events that underlie vascular changes during tumor angiogenesis. Notably, elucidating the mechanism of action of endothelial CAMs in cancer vasculature is expected to open new therapeutic avenues aimed at interfering with tumor growth and dissemination.",M1
19479183,"Enhanced mobilization of CD34(+) progenitor cells expressing cell adhesion molecules in patients with STEMI.BACKGROUND: Adult stem cells can contribute to myocardial regeneration after ischemic injury. The aim of the study was to determine (1) the amount of mobilized CD34(+)/CD117(+), CD34(+)/KDR(+) cells into peripheral blood (PB) in relation to inflammatory and haematopoietic cytokines, (2) the presence of circulating CD34(+) cells, expressing cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>), in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in comparison to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with STEMI (&lt;12 h), 24 patients with CAD and 15 control subjects were enrolled in this study. The patients were matched in age, 2-CAD, ejection fraction (45%) and end-diastolic volume index (70 ml/m(2)). The number of stem cells and the expression of adhesion molecules were quantified by use of flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor] and chemotactic factors as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: The amount of circulating progenitor cells including CD34(+)/CD117(+) and CD34(+)/KDR(+) cells was significantly higher in patients with STEMI than in patients with CAD (CD34(+)/CD117(+) 433 +/- 128 vs. 100 +/- 17, P = 0.012; CD34(+)/KDR(+) 253 +/- 41 vs. 128 +/- 24, P = 0.02). The mobilization of CD34(+) progenitor cells expressing CXCR4-receptor, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and ICAM-1 into PB was significantly higher in patients with STEMI compared to CAD (CD34(+)/CXCR4(+) 740 +/- 327 vs. 136 +/- 23, P = 0.006; CD34(+)/LFA-1 976 +/- 227 vs. 329 +/- 41, P = 0.025; CD34(+)/VLA4(+) 830 +/- 161 vs. 330 +/- 31, P = 0.007; CD34(+)/ICAM(+) 387 +/- 66 vs. 144 +/- 26, P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the cytokines G-CFS, IL-6 and HGF were upregulated and significantly increase in the STEMI group compared with controls and CAD (G-CSF 50.6 +/- 6.8 vs. 23 +/- 3 vs. 23.8 +/- 2, P (Co vs. STEMI) &lt; 0.001, P (Co vs. CAD) = n.s., P (STEMI vs. CAD) &lt; 0.001; IL-6 8.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 2.6 +/- 1, P (Co vs. STEMI) &lt; 0.001, P (Co vs. CAD) = n.s., P (STEMI vs. CAD) &lt; 0.001; HGF 4,502 +/- 461 vs. 686 +/- 195 vs. 1,746 +/- 461, P (Co vs. STEMI) &lt; 0.001, P (Co vs. CAD) = n.s., P (STEMI vs. CAD) &lt; 0.001), while the level of SDF-1 was increased in patients with CAD compared to controls and patients with STEMI (3,035 +/- 286 vs. 2,028 +/- 76 vs. 2,154 +/- 234, P (Co vs. STEMI) = n.s., P (Co vs. CAD) = n.s., P (STEMI vs. CAD) = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates in patients with STEMI an increased mobilization of progenitor cells like CD34(+)/CD117(+) and CD34(+)/KDR(+) compared to CAD. Furthermore, we could shown that in patients with STEMI the mobilization of CD34(+) progenitor cells with expressed CAM was increased. It is to speculate that an enhanced expression of adhesion molecules may increase the transmigration and implantation of progenitor cells into ischemic myocardium for myocardial repair.",M1
19442730,"Effect of high-dose dexamethasone on endothelial haemostatic gene expression and neutrophil adhesion.Glucocorticoid usage especially at high doses is complicated by adverse outcomes such as thrombotic events or acceleration of inflammatory response in conditions like myeloma and osteonecrosis. The mechanism(s) through which high-dose dexamethasone (HDDEXA) causes vascular injury remains unclear. We hypothesized that HDDEXA sensitizes endothelial cells (EC) to the effect of inflammatory mediators and modulates endothelial haemostatic gene expression and leukocyte adhesion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown in the absence or presence of HDDEXA and were also tested in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or thrombin. mRNA and protein expression were measured and the functional consequences of HDDEXA preconditioning on cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) were determined by agonist-mediated leukocyte adhesion assay. Treatment with HDDEXA resulted in an increased induction of CAM, tissue factor and von Willebrand factor, while down-regulating thrombomodulin and urokinase. HDDEXA alone had no effect on adhesion but resulted in enhanced TNF-alpha- and LPS-mediated adhesion of neutrophils. Together, these findings suggest that HDDEXA sensitizes HUVEC to the effect of inflammatory mediators and induces a pro-adhesive environment in primary EC. This finding is of importance when glucocorticoid usage is required at therapeutic high doses in patients with or without thrombotic risk factors.",M1
19401692,"Activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway induces chemoresistance to interferon-alpha/5-fluorouracil combination therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.Type I IFN receptor type 2 (IFNAR2) expression correlates significantly with clinical response to interferon (IFN)-alpha/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, some IFNAR2-positive patients show no response to the therapy. This result suggests the possibility of other factors, which would be responsible for resistance to IFN-alpha/5-FU therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of anti-proliferative effects of IFN-alpha/5-FU therapy and search for a biological marker of chemoresistance to such therapy. Gene expression profiling and molecular network analysis were used in the analysis of non-responders and responders with IFNAR2-positive HCC. The Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway contributed to resistance to IFN-alpha/5-FU therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) expression, the target molecule of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, only in non-responders. In vitro studies showed that activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by glycogen synthesis kinase-3 inhibitor (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO)) induced chemoresistance to IFN-alpha/5-FU. BrdU-based cell proliferation ELISA and cell cycle analysis showed that concurrent addition of BIO and IFN-alpha/5-FU significantly to hepatoma cell cultures reduced the inhibitory effects of the latter two on DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the S-phase. The results indicate that activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway induces chemoresistance to IFN-alpha/5-FU therapy and suggest that Ep-CAM is a potentially useful marker for resistance to such therapy, especially in IFNAR2-positive cases.",M1
19391212,"MOC-31 exhibits superior reactivity compared with Ber-EP4 in invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma of the breast: a tissue microarray study.Distinguishing between reactive mesothelial proliferations and adenocarcinoma is often very difficult. Ancillary studies, in particular immunohistochemistry, are often critical in detecting malignant epithelial cells, especially in serous effusion specimens. MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 are antibodies which target the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>, TACSTD1) expressed in epithelial cells, and both are useful in distinguishing metastatic adenocarcinoma from reactive mesothelial cells. However, the reactivity of MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 with breast carcinoma, one of the more common carcinomas involving serous effusions, has not been extensively studied. We analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 using tissue microarrays containing invasive ductal carcinoma (191 cases), invasive lobular carcinoma (44 cases), and 102 other carcinoma types comprising primary carcinomas of lung, gynecologic tract, pancreas, colon, gastric, esophageal, prostate, head and neck, hepatic, and renal origin. For MOC-31, 184 of 191 (96%) invasive ductal carcinomas and 39 of 44 (89%) invasive lobular carcinomas exhibited diffuse positive staining. In contrast, for Ber-EP4, 121 of 183 (66%) invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 of 40 (27.5%) invasive lobular carcinomas exhibited diffuse positive staining. With the exception of 1 case of esophageal adenocarcinoma, all other adenocarcinomas (86 of 87 cases) exhibited diffuse staining with both Ber-EP4 and MOC-31. MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 exhibited identical staining with all other carcinoma types. Our findings indicate that MOC-31 is superior to Ber-EP4 in detecting both invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma of the breast.",M1
19389799,"Activation of PPARbeta/delta inhibits leukocyte recruitment, cell adhesion molecule expression, and chemokine release.The infiltration of PMNs into tissues is a prominent feature in inflammation. The mechanism underlying PMN recruitment depends on the release of chemotactic mediators and <e>CAM</e> expression on endothelial cells. The nuclear receptor PPARbeta/delta is widely expressed in many tissues, including the vascular endothelium; however, its role in acute inflammation remains unclear. Using intravital microscopy in the mouse cremasteric microcirculation, we have shown that activation of PPARbeta/delta by its selective ligand GW501516 inhibits TNF-alpha-induced leukocyte rolling flux, adhesion, and emigration in a dose-dependant manner. Moreover, GW501516 reduced the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin in the cremasteric postcapillary venules. Similarly, rolling and adhesion of hPMNs under physiological flow on TNF-alpha-activated HUVECs were also inhibited markedly by GW501516. These inhibitory responses of GW501516 on activated endothelium were accompanied by a reduction in TNF-alpha-induced endothelial GRO-alpha release and VCAM-1, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 mRNA expression. Taken together, our results show that PPARbeta/delta modulates acute inflammation in vivo and in vitro under flow by targeting the neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction.",M1
19380349,"Non-conventional markers of atherosclerosis before and after gastric banding surgery.AIMS: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and elevation of traditional and non-traditional risk markers. As bariatric surgery reduces overweight and improves metabolic derangement, we examined a cluster of established and emerging cardiovascular risk factors, such as soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), which might improve prediction of future cardiovascular events because of their more direct involvement in plaque destabilization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Obese patients [n = 32, body mass index (BMI) 46.1 +/- 5.9 kg/m(2)] underwent clinical examinations and blood sampling for measurement of glucose and lipid parameters as well as non-traditional cardiovascular risk markers, i.e. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), soluble cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>), MMP-2, MMP-9, CD40L, and Lp-PLA(2) before and after 1 year following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), respectively. In patients undergoing LAGB, blood pressure (P &lt; 0.0001) and blood glucose (P = 0.02) were significantly lowered by approximately 16% as well as triglyceride levels by approximately 29% (P = 0.002). In addition to a decrease of the inflammatory and pro-thrombotic marker PAI-1 (P = 0.001), CAMs, and MMP-9 (P = 0.004) were reduced, whereas no change was observed for plasma levels of MMP-2, sCD40L, and Lp-PLA(2) after LAGB, respectively. Individual changes in (ICAM-1) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (DeltaICAM-1) were related to changes in insulin (Deltafasting insulin) before and after LAGB (r = 0.36 and r = 0.38; both P = 0.04). E-selectin correlated positively with changes in BMI (r = 0.38; P = 0.04 and r = 0.36; P = 0.05), while Lp-PLA(2) concentration was negatively correlated with BMI (r =-0.41; P = 0.02) after 1 year. Changes were comparable in both overweight diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSION: LAGB not only induced weight loss but also an improvement in the subclinical pro-inflammatory state. However, concentrations of most of the non-traditional risk factors for plaque instability, i.e. MMP-9, sCD40L, and Lp-PLA(2) remained unchanged.",M1
19302955,"Expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule and pituitary tumor transforming gene in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma and its correlation with recurrence of the tumor.Craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors of the sellar region generally associated with endocrine disorders and often locally aggressive. The reliable criteria for predicting the tumor behavior are still lacking. It has been suggested that proliferative potential of the tumor cells is necessary for recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity and correlation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) and pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG-1) immunoexpression that is possibly related to relapse in 40 patients with adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. The study involved clinical and pathologic analysis. Of the subjects, 49% were females and 51% were males. The mean age of the patients was 37 years. Relapsing rate at 5 years was 46% and for death was 22.5%. Histologically, whorl-like arrays and dense or hypercellular stellate reticulum cells were correlated with recurrence. Epithelial CAM and PTTG-1 were also higher in stellate reticulum cells and in whorl-like arrays. Both were higher in recurrence/regrowth tumors than in primary one. The PTGG-1 expression in craniopharyngioma may suggest hypophyseal metaplasia. The Ep-CAM and PTTG-1 expression in craniopharyngioma could be used as prediction markers of relapsing tumor. It has been suggested that proliferative potential of the tumor cells is necessary for recurrence.",M1
19250612,"The bio-complex  reaction pattern in vertebrate cells  reduces cytokine-induced cellular adhesion molecule mRNA expression in human endothelial cells by attenuation of NF-kappaB translocation.The bio-complex  reaction pattern in vertebrate cells  (RiV) is mainly represented by characteristic exosome-like particles--probably as reaction products of cells to specific stress. The transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a central role in inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that RiV particle preparations (RiV-PP) reduce cellular adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>) expression (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) by the attenuation of NF-kappaB translocation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). After 4 hours, pre-incubation of HUVEC with RiV-PP before stimulation with TNF-alpha significantly reduced ICAM-1 (65.5+/-10.3%) and VCAM-1 (71.1+/-12.3%) mRNA expression compared to TNF-alpha-treated cells (100%, n=7). ICAM-1 surface expression was significantly albeit marginally reduced in RiV/TNF-alpha- treated cells (92.0+/-5.6%, n=4). No significant effect was observed on VCAM-1 surface expression. In RiV/TNF-alpha-treated cells (n=4), NF-kappaB subunits p50 (85.7+/-4.1%) and p65 (85.0+/-1.8%) nuclear translocation was significantly reduced. RiV-PP may exert an anti-inflammatory effect in HUVEC by reducing CAM mRNA expression via attenuation of p50 and p65 translocation.",M1
19212205,"Polymorphism in ICAM-1, PECAM-1, E-selectin, and L-selectin genes in Tunisian patients with inflammatory bowel disease.BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic intestinal disorders characterized by immune dysregulation and leukocytes recruitment into gastrointestinal tract. Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) mediate the extravasation of leukocytes and their accumulation in inflamed intestinal mucosa. Recently, CAM genes have been implicated in determining susceptibility to UC and CD. We investigate seven mutations in CAM: G241R and K469E in ICAM-1, V125L in PECAM-1, G98T, S128R, and L554F in E-selectin and F206L in L-selectin in 197 Tunisian patients (73 with UC and 124 with CD) and 194 controls. These polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers and restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: A significant increase in allele frequencies of 206L of L-selectin and the associated genotype F/L was observed in both patients with UC and CD compared with controls. Subgroup analysis showed that the L206 allele and F/L206 genotype frequencies were significantly increased in UC patients with left-sided type; whereas, the F/L206 genotype was significant in CD patients with ileocolonic location and stricturing behavior compared with controls. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were observed for ICAM-1 K469E, E-selectin, and PECAM-1 polymorphisms between UC patients, CD patients, and controls. CONCLUSION: We found an association of inflammatory bowel disease with allele L206 of L-selectin gene, whereas genotype L/F was associated with a subgroup of UC (left-sided type) and CD patients with more extensive location of disease and stricturing behavior. However, further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",M1
19197150,"Cell adhesion molecules as targets for therapy of neuroblastoma.Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) are glycoproteins expressed on the surface of cell membranes. In normal cells, CAMs participate in a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. In tumor cells, CAMs have been reported to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, in signal transduction and as regulators of tumor progression and metastasis. CAMs interact directly with each other as well as with multiple intracellular proteins and extracellular matrix components. Relevant to this review, direct and indirect interactions of CAMs with the extracellular matrix and with the actin cytoskeletal network control cell motility. Cell motility, in turn, regulates the migratory and invasive potential, i.e., the metastatic potential, of tumor cells. The question to be addressed in this review is whether CAM-mediated molecular interactions that regulate metastasis represent potential therapeutic targets for metastatic neuroblastoma.",M1
19135695,"West Nile virus infection modulates human brain microvascular endothelial cells tight junction proteins and cell adhesion molecules: Transmigration across the in vitro blood-brain barrier.Neurological complications such as inflammation, failure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuronal death contribute to the mortality and morbidity associated with WNV-induced meningitis. Compromised BBB indicates the ability of the virus to gain entry into the CNS via the BBB, however, the underlying mechanisms, and the specific cell types associated with WNV-CNS trafficking are not well understood. Brain microvascular endothelial cells, the main component of the BBB, represent a barrier to virus dissemination into the CNS and could play key role in WNV spread via hematogenous route. To investigate WNV entry into the CNS, we infected primary human brain microvascular endothelial (HBMVE) cells with the neurovirulent strain of WNV (NY99) and examined WNV replication kinetics together with the changes in the expressions of key tight junction proteins (TJP) and cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>). WNV infection of HBMVE cells was productive as analyzed by plaque assay and qRT-PCR, and did not induce cytopathic effect. Increased mRNA and protein expressions of TJP (claudin-1) and CAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule and E-selectin) were observed at days 2 and 3 after infection, respectively, which coincided with the peak in WNV replication. Further, using an in vitro BBB model comprised of HBMVE cells, we demonstrate that cell-free WNV can cross the BBB, without compromising the BBB integrity. These data suggest that infection of HBMVE cells can facilitate entry of cell-free virus into the CNS without disturbing the BBB, and increased CAM may assist in the trafficking of WNV-infected immune cells into the CNS, via 'Trojan horse' mechanism, thereby contributing to WNV dissemination in the CNS and associated pathology.",M1
19098912,"Heritable somatic methylation and inactivation of MSH2 in families with Lynch syndrome due to deletion of the 3' exons of TACSTD1.Lynch syndrome patients are susceptible to colorectal and endometrial cancers owing to inactivating germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2 (ref. 1). Here we describe patients from Dutch and Chinese families with MSH2-deficient tumors carrying heterozygous germline deletions of the last exons of TACSTD1, a gene directly upstream of MSH2 encoding Ep-<e>CAM</e>. Due to these deletions, transcription of TACSTD1 extends into MSH2. The MSH2 promoter in cis with the deletion is methylated in Ep-CAM positive but not in Ep-CAM negative normal tissues, thus revealing a correlation between activity of the mutated TACSTD1 allele and epigenetic inactivation of the corresponding MSH2 allele. Gene silencing by transcriptional read-through of a neighboring gene in either sense, as demonstrated here, or antisense direction, could represent a general mutational mechanism. Depending on the expression pattern of the neighboring gene that lacks its normal polyadenylation signal, this may cause either generalized or mosaic patterns of epigenetic inactivation.",M1
19019843,"Cell discohesion and multifocality of carcinoma in situ of the bladder: new insight from the adhesion molecule profile (e-cadherin, Ep-<e>CAM</e>, and MUC1).Urothelial cell carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder is a superficially diffusive and highly discohesive disease. The authors analyzed the expression of some adhesion molecules (e-cadherin and Ep-CAM) and MUC1 in 32 unifocal and multifocal bladder urothelial cell CIS in an attempt to clarify this discohesion. E-cadherin was strongly expressed, in more than 75% of the cases. The presence of methylation of the CDH1 e-cadherin promoter gene was also investigated, but methylation was found in only one case. Ep-CAM was present in all the cases with a heterogeneous staining pattern. Similarly, MUC1/episialin was variously present in 94% of the cases without a polarized staining pattern and was expressed more strongly in cases with multifocal disease. Because loss of MUC1 polarization leads to interference with cell-cell adhesion mechanisms mediated by cadherins, these findings help explain why bladder urothelial cell CIS often shows a discohesive morphology and multifocality despite a strongly expressed adhesion molecule profile. Finally, Ep-CAM expression might provide some support for future target therapy trials.",M1
18850009,"Bortezomib overcomes cell-adhesion-mediated drug resistance through downregulation of VLA-4 expression in multiple myeloma.Multiple myeloma (MM) is incurable, mainly because of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (<e>CAM</e>-DR). In this study, we performed functional screening using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to define the molecule(s) responsible for CAM-DR of MM. Using four bona fide myeloma cell lines (KHM-1B, KMS12-BM, RPMI8226 and U266) and primary myeloma cells, we identified CD29 (beta1-integrin), CD44, CD49d (alpha4-integrin, a subunit of VLA-4), CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)), CD138 (syndecan-1) and CD184 (CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4)) as major adhesion molecules expressed on MM. shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD49d but not CD44, CD54, CD138 and CD184 significantly reversed CAM-DR of myeloma cells to bortezomib, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone. Experiments using blocking antibodies yielded almost identical results. Bortezomib was relatively resistant to CAM-DR because of its ability to specifically downregulate CD49d expression. This property was unique to bortezomib and was not observed in other anti-myeloma drugs. Pretreatment with bortezomib was able to ameliorate CAM-DR of myeloma cells to vincristine and dexamethasone. These results suggest that VLA-4 plays a critical role in CAM-DR of MM cells. The combination of bortezomib with conventional anti-myeloma drugs may be effective in overcoming CAM-DR of MM.",M1
18794096,"Prognostic effect of epithelial cell adhesion molecule overexpression in untreated node-negative breast cancer.PURPOSE: Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) recently received increased attention not only as a prognostic factor in breast cancer but also as a potential target for immunotherapy. We examined Ep-CAM expression in 402 consecutive node-negative breast cancer patients with long-term follow-up not treated in the adjuvant setting. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ep-CAM expression was evaluated by immunostaining. Its prognostic effect was estimated relative to overexpression/amplification of HER-2, histologic grade, tumor size, age, and hormone receptor expression. RESULTS: Ep-CAM status was positive in 106 (26.4%) patients. In multivariate analysis, Ep-CAM status was associated with disease-free survival independent of age, pT stage, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), as well as HER2 status (P = 0.028; hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.44). Recently, so-called triple-negative (HER-2, ER, and PR) breast cancer has received increased attention. We noticed a similar association of Ep-CAM with disease-free survival in the triple-negative group as for the entire cohort. CONCLUSION: In this study of untreated breast cancer patients, Ep-CAM overexpression was associated with poor survival in the entire cohort and in the subgroup of triple-negative breast cancer. This suggests that Ep-CAM may be a well-suited target for specific therapies particularly in HER-2-, ER-, and PR-negative tumors.",M1
18790807,"OKCAM: an ontology-based, human-centered knowledgebase for cell adhesion molecules.'Cell adhesion molecules' (<e>CAMs</e>) are essential elements of cell/cell communication that are important for proper development and plasticity of a variety of organs and tissues. In the brain, appropriate assembly and tuning of neuronal connections is likely to require appropriate function of many cell adhesion processes. Genetic studies have linked and/or associated CAM variants with psychiatric, neurologic, neoplastic, immunologic and developmental phenotypes. However, despite increasing recognition of their functional and pathological significance, no systematic study has enumerated CAMs or documented their global features. We now report compilation of 496 human CAM genes in six gene families based on manual curation of protein domain structures, Gene Ontology annotations, and 1487 NCBI Entrez annotations. We map these genes onto a cell adhesion molecule ontology that contains 850 terms, up to seven levels of depth and provides a hierarchical description of these molecules and their functions. We develop OKCAM, a CAM knowledgebase that provides ready access to these data and ontologic system at http://okcam.cbi.pku.edu.cn. We identify global CAM properties that include: (i) functional enrichment, (ii) over-represented regulation modes and expression patterns and (iii) relationships to human Mendelian and complex diseases, and discuss the strengths and limitations of these data.",M1
18727736,"Expression and putative function of lymphocyte endothelial epithelial-cell adhesion molecule in human testis.The testis is an immunologically privileged site where germ cell antigens are protected from autoimmune attack and foreign tissue grafts may survive for extended periods. However, the testicular environment does not preclude inflammatory reactions and tissue-specific recruitment of T lymphocytes appears to be a crucial component of the inflammation cascade. Here, we demonstrate expression of lymphocyte endothelial epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (LEEP-<e>CAM</e>), a putative receptor mediating lymphocyte adhesion to endothelia and some epithelia, in human testis. In all specimens examined, expression of LEEP-CAM could be observed on endothelial cells of testicular blood vessels, including those within the lamina propria of seminiferous tubules. Sections of histologically normal testis showed strong LEEP-CAM expression within the seminiferous epithelium localised to Sertoli cells, whereas immunoreactivity was almost absent in tubules with severely impaired spermatogenesis. In a modified Stamper-Woodruff adhesion assay, binding of activated lymphocytes to normal testicular tissue was reduced by 61% after incubation with anti-LEEP-CAM mAb as compared with controls (P &lt; 0.00001). In conclusion, intratubular LEEP-CAM expression is correlated with normal spermatogenesis and Sertoli cell function. In this context, it may contribute to adhesive cell-cell interactions. Moreover, the constitutive expression in human testis could play a role for localisation of T cells during testicular inflammation.",M1
18723041,"Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV) induces differential leukocyte accumulation in mice genetically selected for acute inflammatory reaction: the role of host genetic background on expression of adhesion molecules and release of endogenous mediators.The dynamics of the local inflammatory events induced by Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV) inoculation in footpad of mice genetically selected for maximal (AIRmax) and minimal (AIRmin) acute inflammatory reactivity (AIR) was investigated. The BjV injection induced a marked inflammatory cell infiltrate with predominance of neutrophils, with increased blood cell numbers before its accumulation, suggesting a stimulatory action of BjV on mechanisms of cell mobilization from bone marrow. The process of cell migration is regulated by different cell-adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>). Our results showed that neutrophil cells from both lines had the same pattern of response concerning CAMs expression, presenting the involvement of l-selectin, Mac-1 and PECAM-1 adhesion molecules in BjV-induced neutrophil accumulation. The effect of BjV on the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines related with cellular migration was also studied and IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MIP-2 levels could be detected after venom injection. The AIRmax mice were shown to be more responsive than AIRmin with respect to leukocyte influx, expression of MIP-2 and release of IL-1beta and IL-6. These results demonstrate the importance of host genetic background in the local response and the involvement of alleles accumulated in AIRmax mice in the inflammatory events induced by BjV.",M1
18635166,"Laminin alpha 5 mediates ectopic adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma through integrins and/or Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule.Laminins are a diverse group of alpha/beta/gamma heterotrimers formed from five alpha, three beta and three gamma chains; they are major components of all basal laminae (BLs). One laminin chain that has garnered particular interest due to its widespread expression pattern and importance during development is laminin alpha 5. Little is known, however, about the expression and function of laminins containing the alpha 5 chain in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, using a specific antibody, we examined the expression of laminin alpha 5 in normal liver and in HCCs. In normal liver, although laminin alpha 5 was observed in hepatic BLs underlying blood vessels and bile ducts, it was absent from the parenchyma, which may be the origin of HCC. On the other hand, laminin alpha 5 deposition was observed throughout all HCCs tested, regardless of tumor grade. In well-differentiated HCCs, it localized along the trabecules of the tumor. In poorly-differentiated HCCs, it was present in surrounding tumor nodules. In HCC cell lines, laminin alpha 5 heterotrimerized with beta and gamma chains and was secreted into the culture media. To attempt to understand the function of laminins containing alpha 5, the expression of its receptors in HCCs was also determined. In this regard, alpha 3 beta 1/alpha 6 beta 1 integrins and Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule (Lu/B-<e>CAM</e>) were expressed in HCC cells. In vitro studies showed that HCC cells readily attached to laminin containing the alpha 5 chain, more so than did primary hepatocytes. In addition to alpha 3 beta 1/alpha 6 beta 1 integrins and Lu/B-CAM, laminin alpha 5 was recognized by integrin alpha 1 beta 1, which also was expressed in HCC cells. These results suggest that laminins containing alpha 5 serve as functional substrates regulating progression of HCC.",M1
18613029,"NF-kappaB, but not p38 MAP kinase, is required for TNF-alpha-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells.In response to inflammation stimuli, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces expression of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) in endothelial cells (ECs). Studies have suggested that the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the p38 MAP kinase (p38) signaling pathways play central roles in this process, but conflicting results have been reported. The objective of this study is to determine the relative contributions of the two pathways to the effect of TNF-alpha. Our initial data indicated that blockade of p38 activity by chemical inhibitor SB203580 (SB) at 10 microM moderately inhibited TNF-alpha-induced expression of three types of CAMs; ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, indicating that p38 may be involved in the process. However, subsequent analysis revealed that neither 1 microM SB that could completely inhibit p38 nor specific knockdown of p38alpha and p38beta with small interference RNA (siRNA) had an apparent effect, indicating that p38 activity is not essential for TNF-alpha-induced CAMs. The most definitive evidence to support this conclusion was from the experiments using cells differentiated from p38alpha knockout embryonic stem cells. We could show that deletion of p38alpha gene did not affect TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression when compared with wild-type cells. We further demonstrated that inhibition of NF-kappaB completely blocked TNF-alpha-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that NF-kappaB, but not p38, is critical for TNF-alpha-induced CAM expression. The inhibition of SB at 10 microM on TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin is likely due to the nonspecific effect of SB.",M1
18587325,"Disrupted cell adhesion but not proliferation mediates cyst formation in polycystic liver disease.The pathogenesis of polycystic liver disease is not well understood. The putative function of the associated proteins, hepatocystin and Sec63p, do not give insight in their role in cystogenesis and their tissue-wide expression does not fit with the liver-specific phenotype of the disease. We designed this study with the specific aim to dissect whether pathways involved in polycystic kidney diseases are also implicated in polycystic liver disease. Therefore, we immunohistochemically stained cyst tissue specimen with antibodies directed against markers for apoptosis, proliferation, growth receptors, signaling and adhesion. We analyzed genotyped polycystic liver disease cyst tissue (n=21) compared with normal liver tissue (n=13). None of the cysts showed proliferation of epithelial cells. In addition, anti-apoptosis marker Bcl-2 revealed slight increase in expression, with variable increase of apoptosis marker active caspase 3. Growth factor receptors, EGFR and c-erbB-2, were overexpressed and mislocalized. We found EGFR staining in the nuclei of cyst epithelial cells regardless of mutational state of the patient. Further, in hepatocystin-mutant polycystic liver disease patients, apical membranous staining of c-erbB-2 and adhesion markers, MUC1 and CEA, was lost and the proteins appeared to be retained in cytoplasm of cyst epithelia. Finally, we found loss of adhesion molecules E-cadherin and Ep-<e>CAM</e> in cyst epithelium of all patients. Nevertheless, we observed normal beta-catenin expression. Our results show that polycystic liver disease cystogenesis is different from renal cystogenesis. Polycystic liver disease involves overexpression of growth factor receptors and loss of adhesion. In contrast, proliferation or deregulated apoptosis do not seem to be implicated. Moreover differential findings for PRKCSH- and SEC63-associated polycystic liver disease suggest a divergent mechanism for cystogenesis in these two groups.",M1
18393855,"ANTI-ADHESION evolves to a promising therapeutic concept in oncology.Adhesion is a hallmark of haematological and solid cancer cells. All five classes of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) - integrins, cadherins, immunoglobulin-like CAMs, selectins and CD44s - are characteristically dysregulated in human cancer. Adhesion enables and promotes cancer-defining biological processes like growth, survival, migration, extravasation, homing, and metastasis. Furthermore, cell adhesion mediates drug resistance (CAM-DR) in multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma, acute and chronic leukaemias, as well as in pancreatic cancer, neuroblastoma, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, colorectal carcinoma, and breast cancer. Cell adhesion protects from death by radiation, genotoxic chemotherapy, or targeted pathway inhibitors. Adhesion molecules are overexpressed on drug resistant cells (e.g. multiple myeloma or prostate cancer). Very recently, several cell adhesion mediated survival pathways have been elucidated, with key mediators being LFA-1, VLA-4, FAK, ILK, Src, PI3K, Akt, Ras, MEK, Erk, HMG-CoA reductase, Rho, Rho kinase, PKC, and NFkB. Because the surface and the intracellular targets are now known and because specific compounds are becoming increasingly available, first clinical trials regarding ANTI-ADHESION therapies are ongoing. However, in comparison to the comprehensive preclinical and clinical knowledge about CAMs, the number of drugs developed thusfar is quite low. ANTI-ADHESION strategies include targeting of surface antigens, inhibition of cell adhesion associated pathways, inhibition of CAM-DR, and targeted drug delivery. As ANTI-ADHESION is based on general characteristics of cancer cells independent of specific disease entities or treatment modalities, it may become a successful, low-toxic and broadly applicable concept in cancer treatment.",M1
18355175,"Decreased expression of Ep-<e>CAM</e> protein is significantly associated with the progression and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) is involved in cell signaling, migration, proliferation, cell-cycle regulation, and cancer metastasis. METHODS: This study used an immunohistochemical technique to examine the expression of Ep-CAM protein in 84 specimens of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), 98 specimens of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED, 31 mild, 41 moderate, and 26 severe OED cases), and 15 specimens of normal oral mucosa (NOM). RESULTS: We found that the mean Ep-CAM labeling indices (LIs) decreased significantly from NOM (80 +/- 18%) and mild OED (76 +/- 14%) through moderate OED (66 +/- 22%) and severe OED (55 +/- 20%) to OSCC samples (46 +/- 16%, P &lt; 0.001). A significant correlation was found between the lower mean Ep-CAM LI and OSCCs with larger tumor size (P = 0.003), positive lymph node metastasis (P = 0.022), more advanced clinical stages (P &lt; 0.001), cancer recurrence (P = 0.021), or extracapsular spread of lymph node (P = 0.015). However, only Ep-CAM LI &lt; 50% (P &lt; 0.0001) was identified as an independent unfavorable prognosis factor by multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard regression model. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that OSCC patients with an Ep-CAM LI &lt; 50% had a significantly poorer cumulative survival than those with an Ep-CAM LI &gt; or = 50% (P &lt; 0.00001, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the decreased expression of Ep-CAM protein is an early event in oral carcinogenesis. The Ep-CAM LI in OSCC samples can predict the progression of OSCCs and the survival of OSCC patients.",M1
18319592,"mTOR inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors do not affect adhesion molecule expression of human macro- and microvascular endothelial cells.We examined the effect of cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus on the cell growth, viability, proliferation, expression of cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) and leukocyte (PBMC) binding of human macrovascular (coronary artery, saphenous vein) and microvascular endothelial cells (EC). Tacrolimus did not affect EC integrity, growth or expression of CAM. Exclusively, EC from the coronary arteries showed a reduced cellular growth (about 30%) under cyclosporin A and tacrolimus treatment. In contrast, treatment with mTOR inhibitors reduced EC proliferative activity by about 40%, independently of the EC origin. No induction of apoptosis (caspase-3/7 activity) or cytotoxicity (MTS test) was observed. Long-term treatment with high concentrations of sirolimus and everolimus did not enhance the expression of CAM. Stimulation with tumor necrosis factor significantly increased the expression of CAM, independently of the drugs used. None of the mTOR inhibitors influenced the tumor necrosis factor-induced expression of CAM, whereas adhesion of PBMC increased significantly, as described by other papers. In summary, neither calcineurin inhibitors nor mTOR inhibitors activate human micro- and macrovascular EC. Therefore, the investigated drugs are unlikely to contribute to EC activation during transplant-associated vasculopathy.",M1
18319540,"Regulation of epithelial cell adhesion and repulsion: role of endocytic recycling.A proper balance between cell adhesion and repulsion is essential for cellular morphogenesis during epithelial-mesenchymal transition and mesenchymal-epithelial transition. A number of ligand-receptor pairs including hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-Met and semaphorin-plexin are known to control this balance through the complex intracellular signaling pathways. Cell adhesion to other cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) is mediated by cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) and ECM receptors, respectively, which are associated with cytoskeleton through a variety of plaque proteins strengthening and/or weakening adhesion activities. Cell repulsion requires the downregulation of cell adhesion and the extensive changes in cytoskeletal dynamics. The endocytic recycling of CAMs and ECM receptors has recently emerged as an important mechanism to control the balance between cell adhesion and repulsion. Molecule interacting with CasL (MICAL) family proteins are originally identified as a plaque protein associated with ECM receptors integrins and implicated in semaphorin-plexin dependent repulsive axon guidance. We have recently shown that MICAL family protein JRAB/MICAL-L2 functions as an effector protein for Rab family small G protein Rab13 and regulates the endocytic recycling of tight junctional CAM occludin and controls the adhesion and repulsion of epithelial cells.",M1
18158927,"Basal cell (trichoblastic) carcinoma common expression pattern for epithelial cell adhesion molecule links basal cell carcinoma to early follicular embryogenesis, secondary hair germ, and outer root sheath of the vellus hair follicle: A clue to the adnexal nature of basal cell carcinoma?BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is still viewed by many dermatologists as a tumor of the interfollicular epidermis, although references were made early in the dermatopathologic literature to the resemblance of BCC to the hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize the common expression pattern for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) in BCCs, various stages of follicular embryogenesis, and adult hair follicles and, thereby, in analogy point to the similarity between BCC and the hair follicle. METHODS: We studied immunohistochemically 16 superficial BCCs for Ep-CAM and compared the expression pattern with that during hair follicle, nail, and eccrine gland development in human embryos and fetuses. In addition, we examined terminal scalp and vellus hair follicles. RESULTS: All BCCs expressed Ep-CAM similar to the early stages of the embryonic human hair follicle, the secondary hair germ, and the outer root sheath of the vellus hair follicle. The embryonic nail organ and the adult anagen hair follicles were completely negative. LIMITATIONS: The conclusions are based on the similarity in the immunohistochemical expression profile for a single adhesion molecule. CONCLUSION: BCC expresses the cell-cell adhesion molecule Ep-CAM similar to the embryonic hair germ, the secondary hair germ of the terminal hair follicle, and the outer root sheath of the vellus hair follicle. We suggest that this may be a clue to the adnexal nature of BCC and propose that BCC is the most primitive follicular tumor.",M1

A key success in this field is evident from the potential role of the platelet GPIIb/IIIa integrin in the prevention and diagnosis of various thromboembolic disorders. Additionally, the use of soluble adhesion molecules as potential diagnostic markers for acute and chronic leukocyte, platelet, and endothelial cellular insult are increasingly utilized.

17991660,"Down-regulation of adhesion molecules and other inflammatory biomarkers after moderate wine consumption in healthy women: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Moderate alcohol consumption is cardioprotective. The mechanism for this beneficial effect might be reduced inflammatory responses, as suggested by prospective studies and small clinical trials in men. No studies have evaluated the antiinflammatory effects of wine in women. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether low-dose intake of white and red wines has differential effects on inflammatory markers in women. DESIGN: In a crossover study, we randomly assigned 35 healthy women to two 4-wk periods of 20 g ethanol/d as white or red wine, preceded by two 4-wk washout periods. Before and after interventions, we measured serum lipids, circulating inflammatory biomarkers, cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>), and adhesion of monocytes to stimulated endothelial cells. RESULTS: HDL cholesterol increased, and the serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, CD40L, and interleukin-6 decreased after either wine (P &lt; 0.01, all). Vascular CAM-1 and E-selectin decreased (P &lt; 0.01) only after red wine. CAM expression by mononuclear cells was blunted after either wine, with a greater suppressant effect of red wine. Enhanced adhesion of monocytes to stimulated endothelial cells was reduced by 51% (95% CI: -57%, -45%) after white wine and by 89% (95% CI: -96%, -82%) after red wine (P = 0.01 for between-wine differences). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate wine consumption is associated with beneficial effects on various inflammatory pathways related to endothelial activation in women. Probably because of its higher polyphenol content, red wine shows superior antiinflammatory effects than does white wine. Reducing low-grade inflammation and endothelial activation may be another potential mechanism by which alcoholic beverages exert their cardioprotective effect.",M1
17936269,"Cell adhesion molecule Echinoid associates with unconventional myosin VI/Jaguar motor to regulate cell morphology during dorsal closure in Drosophila.Echinoid (Ed) is a homophilic immunoglobulin domain-containing cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>) that localizes to adherens junctions (AJs) and cooperates with Drosophila melanogaster epithelial (DE)-cadherin to mediate cell adhesion. Here we show that Ed takes part in many processes of dorsal closure, a morphogenetic movement driven by coordinated cell shape changes and migration of epidermal cells to cover the underlying amnioserosa. Ed is differentially expressed, appearing in epidermis but not in amnioserosa cells. Ed functions independently from the JNK signaling pathway and is required to regulate cell morphology, and for assembly of actomyosin cable, filopodial protrusion and coordinated cell migration in dorsal-most epidermal cells. The effect of Ed on cell morphology requires the presence of the intracellular domain (Ed(intra)). Interestingly, Ed forms homodimers in vivo and Ed(intra) monomer directly associates with unconventional myosin VI/Jaguar (Jar) motor protein. We further show that ed genetically interacts with jar to control cell morphology. It has previously been shown that myosin VI is monomeric in vitro and that its dimeric form can associate with and travel processively along actin filaments. Thus, we propose that Ed mediates the dimerization of myosin VI/Jar in vivo which in turn regulates the reorganization and/or contraction of actin filaments to control changes in cell shape. Consistent with this, we found that ectopic ed expression in the amnioserosa induces myosin VI/Jar-dependent apical constriction of this tissue.",M1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a tetra-cell adhesion molecule (T-<e>CAM</e>) coating composed of 4 cell-adhesion molecules-an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence, a proline-histidine-serine-arginine-asparagine (PHSRN) sequence, a tyrosine-histidine sequence (YH), and a glutamic acid-proline-aspartic acid-isoleucine-methionine (EPDIM)-on the rough-surfaced titanium implant on peri-implant bone formation in the rabbit femur with poor local bone conditions and minimal primary stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven T-CAM-coated (blasted/T-CAM) and uncoated (blasted) implants with a rough surface (hydroxyapatite-blasted; Ra = 1.8 microm) were placed in slightly oversized beds of the metaphyses of the right and left femurs of 7 New Zealand White rabbits with light tactile pressure, and minimal primary stability was obtained. To evaluate the effects of T-CAM coating on the peri-implant bone healing response, histomorphometric analysis was performed 8 weeks after surgery. The 2 groups were compared using the Student t test, with a significance level of P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Compared to uncoated blasted implants at 8 weeks of healing, the blasted/T-CAM implants showed a significantly greater amount of bone-implant contact (BIC; P &lt; .01) and new bone formation in the zones 0 to 100 microm and 0 to 500 microm lateral to the implant surface (P &lt; .05) in the medullary space. CONCLUSION: The T-CAM coating on the rough-surfaced titanium implants significantly enhanced peri-implant bone formation in rabbit femurs with poor local bone condition.",M1
17905723,"STIM2 protein mediates distinct store-dependent and store-independent modes of CRAC channel activation.STIM1 and CRACM1 (or Orai1) are essential molecular components mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) currents. Although STIM1 acts as a luminal Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the function of STIM2 remains unclear. Here we reveal that STIM2 has two distinct modes of activating CRAC channels: a store-operated mode that is activated through depletion of ER Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and store-independent activation that is mediated by cell dialysis during whole-cell perfusion. Both modes are regulated by calmodulin (<e>CaM</e>). The store-operated mode is transient in intact cells, possibly reflecting recruitment of CaM, whereas loss of CaM in perfused cells accounts for the persistence of the store-independent mode. The inhibition by CaM can be reversed by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), resulting in rapid, store-independent activation of CRAC channels. The aminoglycoside antibiotic G418 is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of STIM2-dependent CRAC channel activation. The results reveal a novel bimodal control of CRAC channels by STIM2, the store dependence and CaM regulation, which indicates that the STIM2/CRACM1 complex may be under the control of both luminal and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels.",M1
17709431,"Neurofascin assembles a specialized extracellular matrix at the axon initial segment.Action potential initiation and propagation requires clustered Na(+) (voltage-gated Na(+) [Nav]) channels at axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. In addition to ion channels, these domains are characterized by cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>; neurofascin-186 [NF-186] and neuron glia-related CAM [NrCAM]), cytoskeletal proteins (ankyrinG and betaIV spectrin), and the extracellular chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan brevican. Schwann cells initiate peripheral nervous system node formation by clustering NF-186, which then recruits ankyrinG and Nav channels. However, AIS assembly of this protein complex does not require glial contact. To determine the AIS assembly mechanism, we silenced expression of AIS proteins by RNA interference. AnkyrinG knockdown prevented AIS localization of all other AIS proteins. Loss of NF-186, NrCAM, Nav channels, or betaIV spectrin did not affect other neuronal AIS proteins. However, loss of NF-186 blocked assembly of the brevican-based AIS extracellular matrix, and NF-186 overexpression caused somatodendritic brevican clustering. Thus, NF-186 assembles and links the specialized brevican-containing AIS extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton.",M1
17689945,"Piper longum Linn. Extract inhibits TNF-alpha-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation and microsomal lipid peroxidation.Recruitment of specific leukocyte subpopulations at the site of inflammation requires a series of cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>)-mediated interactions. The major CAMs, viz., intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), VCAM-1 and E-selectin are expressed on endothelium in response to various cytokines or bacterial LPS. Here, we have evaluated the effect of Piper longum chloroform extract (PlCE) on TNF-alpha-induced expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells and on NADPH-catalyzed rat liver microsomal lipid peroxidation with a view to identify modulators for the expression of CAMs. We demonstrate that PlCE inhibits adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial monolayer. This inhibition is due to the ability of PlCE to significantly block the TNF-alpha-induced expression of CAMs, i.e. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 at 17.5 microg/ml concentration and E-selectin at 15 microg/ml concentration on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The inhibition of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin by PlCE is mediated through inhibition of NF-kappaB in endothelial cells. To demonstrate the antioxidant activity of PlCE, we showed that PlCE inhibited the NADPH-catalyzed rat liver microsomal lipid peroxidation significantly. These results suggest a possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant activity of PlCE.",M1
17681789,"Neurofascin regulates the formation of gephyrin clusters and their subsequent translocation to the axon hillock of hippocampal neurons.Little is known about the role of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) in inhibitory synapse development. In particular, a functional link between CAMs and the clustering of postsynaptic scaffold component gephyrin, which is a critical determinant of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor clustering, still needs to be elaborated. At early stages of inhibitory synapse formation, gephyrin and CAM neurofascin are diffusely expressed in the soma of hippocampal neurons. Subsequently, gephyrin clusters become localized to the axon hillock and neurofascin is observed all over the soma including the axon hillock suggesting a function for neurofascin in gephyrin clustering. Transfection of expression vectors for different isoforms and mutants of neurofascin revealed that neurofascin is required for the formation of gephyrin clusters presumably dependent on extracellular interactions. Furthermore, expression of neurofascin is necessary for the translocation of gephyrin clusters to the axon hillock of hippocampal neurons as shown by shRNA-mediated knockdown. In addition, overexpression of an embryonic neurofascin isoform is sufficient for functional rescue after knockdown of endogenous neurofascin.",M1
17646933,"Cadherins are regulated by Ep-<e>CAM</e> via phosphaditylinositol-3 kinase.The cross-signaling between (cell) adhesion molecules is nowadays a well-accepted phenomenon and includes orchestrated cellular changes and changes in the microenvironment. For example, Ep-CAM is an epithelial adhesion molecule that prevails in active proliferating tissue and is suppressed in a more differentiated state of the cell. E-cadherin adhesion complexes are typical for the advanced and terminal differentiated cell status. During normal proliferation, E-cadherin is not suppressed. We have demonstrated the effect of overexpression of Ep-CAM on E-cadherin, which probably affects the connection of cadherins and F-actin. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3K) participates in various regulating mechanisms, for example in signaling to nuclei, vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The effect of Ep-CAM on E-cadherin mediated junctions as well as the involvement of Pi3K in regulating adherens junctions, led us to investigate the potential interaction between Pi3K and Ep-CAM. Introduction of Ep-CAM in the epithelial cells caused abrogation of N-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion, which could be inhibited by Pi3K inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, the Pi3K subunit p85 was precipitated with Ep-CAM from cell lysates, and this complex showed kinase activity. The Pi3K activity shuttled from N-cadherin to Ep-CAM. From our results, we conclude that Ep-CAM cross signaling with N-cadherin involves Pi3K, resulting in the abrogation of the cadherin adhesion complexes in epithelial cells.",M1
17606991,"Cooperative roles of Par-3 and afadin in the formation of adherens and tight junctions.Par-3 is a cell-polarity protein that regulates the formation of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells, where claudin is a major cell-cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>). TJs are formed at the apical side of adherens junctions (AJs), where E-cadherin and nectin are major CAMs. We have revealed that nectin first forms cell-cell adhesions, and then recruits cadherin to nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites to form AJs and subsequently recruits claudin to the apical side of AJs to form TJs. The cytoplasmic tail of nectin binds afadin and Par-3. Afadin regulates the formation of AJs and TJs cooperatively with nectin. Here, we studied the role of Par-3 in the formation of these junctions by using Par-3-knockdown MDCK cells. Par-3 was necessary for the formation of AJs and TJs but was not necessary for nectin-based cell-cell adhesion. Par-3 promoted the association of afadin with nectin, whereas afadin was not necessary for the association of Par-3 with nectin. However, the association of afadin with nectin alone was not sufficient for the formation of AJs or TJs, and Par-3 and afadin cooperatively regulated it. We describe here these novel roles of Par-3 in the formation of junctional complexes.",M1
17519975,"Cerebral ischemia causes dysregulation of synaptic adhesion in mouse synaptosomes.Synaptic pathology is observed during hypoxic events in the central nervous system in the form of altered dendrite structure and conductance changes. These alterations are rapidly reversible, on the return of normoxia, but are thought to initiate subsequent neuronal cell death. To characterize the effects of hypoxia on regulators of synaptic stability, we examined the temporal expression of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) in synaptosomes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. We focused on events preceding the onset of ischemic neuronal cell death (&lt;48 h). Synaptosome preparations were enriched in synaptically localized proteins and were free of endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear contamination. Electron microscopy showed that the synaptosome preparation was enriched in spheres (approximately 650 nm in diameter) containing secretory vesicles and postsynaptic densities. Forebrain mRNA levels of synaptically located CAMs was unaffected at 3 h after MCAO. This is contrasted by the observation of consistent downregulation of synaptic CAMs at 20 h after MCAO. Examination of synaptosomal CAM protein content indicated that certain adhesion molecules were decreased as early as 3 h after MCAO. For comparison, synaptosomal Agrn protein levels were unaffected by cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, a marked increase in the levels of p-Ctnnb1 in ischemic synaptosomes was observed. p-Ctnnb1 was detected in hippocampal fiber tracts and in cornu ammonis 1 neuronal nuclei. These results indicate that ischemia induces a dysregulation of a subset of synaptic proteins that are important regulators of synaptic plasticity before the onset of ischemic neuronal cell death.",M1
17516570,"Exploration of target molecules for prostate cancer gene therapy.BACKGROUND: Focusing on Adv-FZ33, a modified adenovirus in which a synthetic 33-amino-acid immunoglobulin G-binding domain was inserted into the adenoviral fiber protein, we tried to identify suitable target molecules for prostate cancer-specific gene therapy. METHODS: Hybridomas were established from mice immunized with prostate cancer cell lines. The hybridomas were screened using Adv-FZ33 to create monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that induced high gene transfer efficiency for PC-3 cells. Furthermore, we identified target antigens of the mAbs by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, and investigated the expression of target molecules by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Using Adv-FZ33, we established four different mouse mAbs that increased transduction efficiency for PC-3. The target antigens identified were Ep-<e>CAM</e>, CD155, HAI-1, and Na,K-ATPase beta1. These antigens were expressed in several cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer. Human prostatic myofibroblast cells lacked expression of Ep-CAM and HAI-1. CONCLUSIONS: We established anti-Ep-CAM mAb and anti- HAI-1 mAbs. Gene transduction via Ep-CAM and HAI-1 may be a novel strategy for treatment of prostate cancer.",M1
17483743,"Effect of arginine on cellular adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte transmigration in endothelial cells stimulated by biological fluid from surgical patients.This study investigated the effect of different arginine (Arg) concentrations on adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells (ECs) and leukocytes and the transendothelial migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) through ECs stimulated by plasma or peritoneal drain fluid (PDF) from surgical patients. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and PMNs from healthy subjects were treated with different concentrations (0, 50, 100, and 1000 micromol/L) of Arg for 24 h. After that, HUVECs were stimulated for 3 h with plasma or PDF from patients who underwent abdominal surgery, and PMNs were allowed to transmigrate through ECs for 2 h. The HUVEC expression of cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) and integrin (CD11b) and the interleukin (IL) 8 receptor expression on PMNs were measured by flow cytometry. The PMNs transmigrating through ECs were also analyzed. The results showed that CAM and integrin expressions in PDF groups were higher than those in control groups. Among the PDF groups, IL-8 secretions from ECs and PMNs were lower with 100 and 1000 micromol/L Arg than with 0 and 50 micromol/L Arg, and this was consistent with the expression of the IL-8 receptor on PMNs. In addition, CAM expressions on ECs and CD11b expression on PMNs, as well as PMN transmigration, were lower with 100 and 1000 micromol/L Arg than with 0 and 50 micromol/L Arg. The HUVECs stimulated by plasma from surgical patients had similar effects on surface molecule expression as PDF; however, as shown in PDF stimulation, the effects were not so obvious. Inhibition of nitric oxide production results in high CAM and IL-8 expressions comparable with groups with low Arg administration. The results of this in vitro study suggest that ECs and PMNs were activated after patients' plasma or PDF stimulation. A low Arg concentration comparable with catabolic conditions resulted in higher adhesion molecule expression and greater transendothelial migration of neutrophils. Arginine administration at levels similar to or higher than physiological concentrations reduced IL-8 and CAM expression, and PMN transmigration was also decreased after stimulation with plasma or PDF from surgical patients. Inactivation of NO results in high CAM and IL-8 expression. This finding indicated that NO may be an important endogenous inhibitor for EC-PMN interaction and neutrophil transmigration.",M1
17397316,"Influence of periodontal therapy on the regulation of soluble cell adhesion molecule expression in aggressive periodontitis patients.BACKGROUND: Inflammatory periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Circulating cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], and E-selectin) have been suggested as potential candidate markers of endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The regulation of CAM in subjects with severe periodontitis and the influence of periodontal intervention on systemic CAM levels are not clear. The aim of this study was to determine whether intensive periodontal therapy reduces serum levels of CAM in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. METHODS: Blood samples were collected at six treatment time points from 21 patients with previously untreated generalized aggressive periodontitis (mean age: 34.6 +/- 4.3 years). Patients received subgingival scaling and root planing and antibiotic therapy and were monitored over a 6-month recall period. Serum levels of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1), VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1), and E-selectin (sE-selectin) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: sE-selectin plasma levels decreased significantly (P &lt;0.01) during periodontal therapy. Mean plasma levels were 65.95 ng/ml before treatment and 44.71 ng/ml 6 months after antibiotic therapy. sICAM-1 and sVCAM-2 serum levels were unaffected by therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal therapy reduces plasma sE-selectin levels. Whether this leads to a reduction in risk of future cardiovascular events in patients with aggressive periodontal disease warrants further studies.",M1
17383963,"The LG1-3 tandem of laminin alpha5 harbors the binding sites of Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule and alpha3beta1/alpha6beta1 integrins.The laminin-type globular (LG) domains of laminin alpha chains have been implicated in various cellular interactions that are mediated through receptors such as integrins, alpha-dystroglycan, syndecans, and the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu). Lu, an Ig superfamily transmembrane receptor specific for laminin alpha5, is also known as basal cell adhesion molecule (B-<e>CAM</e>). Although Lu/B-CAM binds to the LG domain of laminin alpha5, the binding site has not been precisely defined. To better delineate this binding site, we produced a series of recombinant laminin trimers containing modified alpha chains, such that all or part of alpha5LG was replaced with analogous segments of human laminin alpha1LG. In solid phase binding assays using a soluble Lu (Lu-Fc) composed of the Lu extracellular domain and human IgG1 Fc, we found that Lu bound to Mr5G3, a recombinant laminin containing alpha5 domains LN through LG3 fused to human laminin alpha1LG4-5. However, Lu/B-CAM did not bind other recombinant laminins containing alpha5LG3 unless alpha5LG1-2 was also present. A recombinant alpha5LG1-3 tandem lacking the laminin coiled coil (LCC) domain did not reproduce the activity of Lu/B-CAM binding. Therefore, proper structure of the alpha5LG1-3 tandem with the LCC domain was essential for the binding of Lu/B-CAM to laminin alpha5. Our results also suggest that the binding site for Lu/B-CAM on laminin alpha5 may overlap with that of integrins alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1.",M1
17361206,"Loss of membranous Ep-<e>CAM</e> in budding colorectal carcinoma cells.Tumor budding is a histological feature that reflects loss of adhesion of tumor cells and is associated with locoregional metastasis of colorectal carcinoma. Although nuclear localization of beta-catenin is associated with tumor budding, the molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. In this study, we hypothesize that the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) is involved in tumor budding. In order to address this question, we performed immunohistochemistry on Ep-CAM using three different antibodies (monoclonal antibodies Ber-ep4 and 311-1K1 and a polyclonal antibody) and a double staining on beta-catenin and Ep-CAM. In addition, Ep-CAM mRNA was monitored with mRNA in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we determined the effect of Ep-CAM staining patterns on tumor spread in rectal cancer. In contrast to the tumor mass, budding cells of colorectal carcinoma displayed lack of membranous but highly increased cytoplasmic Ep-CAM staining and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. mRNA in situ hybridization suggested no differences in Ep-CAM expression between the invasive front and the tumor mass. Importantly, reduced Ep-CAM staining at the invasive margin of rectal tumor specimens (n=133) correlated significantly with tumor budding, tumor grade and an increased risk of local recurrence (P=0.001, P=0.04 and P=0.03, respectively). These data demonstrate abnormal processing of Ep-CAM at the invasive margin of colorectal carcinomas. Our observations indicate that loss of membranous Ep-CAM is associated with nuclear beta-catenin localization and suggest that this contributes to reduced cell-cell adhesions, increased migratory potential and tumor budding.",M1
17353165,"The stroke trial - can we predict clinical outcome of patients with ischemic stroke by measuring soluble cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>)?BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that an increased concentration of haemostatic or inflammation markers was associated with worse prognosis in vascular disease. The inflammatory components in ischemic stroke are of current interest, and there is some experimental evidence that they may be linked. HYPOTHESIS: The study was performed to determine the association between the neurological clinical outcome and levels of cell adhesion molecules in the first four days of hospitalization in patients with acute ischemic event. METHODS: This prospective, pilot, case-controlled study examined the association between the clinical outcome and inflammatory markers within the first few days of hospitalization. The neurological evaluation was performed using the NIH score on admission and four days later, and levels of cell adhesion molecules were measured by ELISA methods on admission and four days later. RESULTS: Twenty three patients with an acute cerebral event (mean age 71 +/- 15 y, 12 women and 11 men) were examined neurologically on admission and four days later. Among 19 patients who improved, there was a significant decrease in the NIH neurological scale, from 3.8 +/- 3.2 to 1.3 +/- 1.8 (p = 0.01), which was accompanied by a significant decrease in the cell adhesion molecules that were measured (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1). Of the four patients who did not improve, their mean clinical NIH score was 10 +/- 4.6 and worsened or remained unchanged after four days of follow-up. In this group, we could not demonstrate a significant change in levels of cell adhesion molecules between days one and four. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who improved clinically within the first four days of hospitalization demonstrated a remarkable inhibition of all three cell adhesion molecules that were measured (E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1). Patients who did not improve had more severe cerebral infarcts, a higher NIH score on admission (10 +/- 4.6), and no change was observed in levels of cell adhesion molecules during the follow-up period. Measuring cell adhesion molecule levels may predict objectively the clinical outcome in hospitalized patients with acute ischemic stroke.",M1
17348690,"Kinetic and structural studies on interactions between heparin or heparan sulfate and proteins of the hedgehog signaling pathway.Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (PGs) interact with a number of extracellular signaling proteins, thereby playing an essential role in the regulation of many physiological processes. These interactions are important for both normal signal transduction and regulation of the tissue distribution of signaling molecules. In this study, we use surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to study interactions of HS and structurally related heparin with proteins in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SPR analysis shows that heparin binds with different affinities to active fragments of the proteins Hedgehog (Hh), Interference Hedgehog (Ihog), <e>Cam</e>-related/Down-regulated by Oncogenes (CDO), and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Solution competition studies show that the minimum size of a heparin oligosaccharide capable of interacting with Ihog is larger than a tetrasaccharide and for interacting with Shh is larger than an octasaccharide. In comparison with heparin, Ihog and Shh exhibited a lower affinity for HS than for heparin, and CDO and Hh exhibit negligible binding to HS. This study clearly demonstrates Shh and Ihog are heparin and HS binding proteins and that both molecules preferentially bind heparin or HS having a high level of sulfation.",M1
17280489,"Spatial coordination of cell-adhesion molecules and redox cycling of iron in the microvascular inflammatory response to pulmonary injury.Transmigration of phagocytic leukocytes (PLCs) from the peripheral blood into injured lung requires a conversion of the microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) to the proinflammatory phenotypes and spatiotemporal interplay of different types of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) on PLC and endothelium. The present report is focused on involvement of iron-dependent redox signaling in spatial coordination of lung CAM due to either a pulmonary trauma or endotracheal iron administration in rats. Redox alterations, deposition of 3-nitrotyrosine, expression of VE-cadherin, ICAM-1, and the PLC integrins, and the status of thioredoxin, Ref-1, NF-kappaB and Nrf2 redox-sensitive elements in the alveolar microvasculature were assessed with EPR spectroscopy, immunobloting, and confocal microscopy. We demonstrated for the first time in vivo that the presence of catalytically active iron, deposition of myeloperoxidase, and induction of the oxidative stress in the lung-injury models were accompanied by (a) downregulation of VE-cadherin, (b) upregulation and polarization of ICAM-1 and the PLC integrins, and (c) nuclear translocation and interaction of thioredoxin, Ref-1, and NF-kappaB and complex structural changes in EC and PLC at the sites of their contacts. The studies suggested that a part of the proinflammatory action of iron in the lung resulted from its stimulation of the redox-sensitive factors.",M1
17213811,"DNA methylation and histone modification regulate silencing of epithelial cell adhesion molecule for tumor invasion and progression.Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) is believed to have a critical role in carcinogenesis and cell proliferation. However, the association of Ep-CAM with cancer invasion and progression is less clear. We found that Ep-CAM was highly expressed on low-invasive cells compared with highly invasive cells. Forced expression of Ep-CAM decreased cancer invasiveness, and silencing Ep-CAM expression elevated cancer invasiveness. Ep-CAM expression was associated with promoter methylation. Treatment with a demethylating agent, and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated Ep-CAM expression in Ep-CAM-negative cells and inhibited cancer invasiveness. Using a promoter-reporter construct, we demonstrated methylation of the promoter fragment drive Ep-CAM-silenced transcription. Additionally, silenced Ep-CAM gene in cancer cells was enriched for hypermethylated histone 3 lysine 9. When unmethylated and active, this promoter was associated with acetylated histone 3 lysine 9. Furthermore, we observed an increased association of Ep-CAM promoter with repression components as tumor invasiveness increased. In cancer tissues, Ep-CAM expression significantly correlated with tumor progression and associated with promoter methylation. Our data support the idea that modulation of Ep-CAM plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion and progression. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation of Ep-CAM is implicated in enhancing invasive/metastatic proclivity of tumors.",M1
17205779,"[The role of integrins in the physiologic and pathogenic processes]Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) are a numerous, diverse group of cell surface proteins, which are both receptors and ligands for receptors. Their functions include adhesion, recognition, cell-cell interaction, and communication between mediate cells and extracellular matrix. The following groups of CAM can be distinguished: seletins, integrins, cadherins and other isoforms, including CD 44. Integrins are heterodimers formed from the alpha and beta chains. The a subclass is responsible for a specific bond with ligands. It defines the specificity of integrins. The 8 chain participates in the integration with cytoskeleton ptoteins. It determines the functions of the integrin receptor. The best recognized integrins include: integrin beta1, beta2 and beta3. The expression and activity of integrins have been found to be affected by a variety of factors being either activators or inhibitors. Adhesion molecules (including integrins) play a significant role in both physiological processes (embryogenesis, organogenesis, the normal growth and tissue development) and pathogenic ones. In the latter case, they are particularly involved in inflammatory, allergic and neoplastic diseases. The role of integrins is also emphasized in organ response to trauma and in skin lesion redevelopment. The knowlegde of the integrin molecular basis and that of other adhesion molecules can contribute significantly to the creation of new diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. An adequate modification of cellular adhesion constitutes a promising way of the pathogenic processes control.",M1
17202440,"Parenteral nutrition and fasting reduces mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) mRNA in Peyer's patches of mice.BACKGROUND: Mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) in Peyer's patches (PP) is the gateway molecule for cellular migration into the mucosal immune system. Lack of enteral feeding during parenteral nutrition (PN) rapidly decreases PP MAdCAM-1, leading to drops in mucosal T and B cells and intestinal and respiratory IgA. We determined the molecular events associated with MAdCAM-1 mRNA and protein during PN (short and long term) and fasting (1 and 2 days). METHODS: Experiment 1: Cannulated mice received PN for 8 hours (short-term PN, n = 6) or chow + saline (chow, n = 6). Experiment 2: Cannulated mice received PN (long-term PN, n = 4) or chow (n = 3) for 5 days. Experiment 3: Noncannulated chow mice were fasted for 1 and 2 days (n = 2/time). Total cellular RNA from the PP was quantified for MAdCAM-1 mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MAdCAM-1 protein was measured by Western blot. RESULTS: PN rapidly down-regulated MAdCAM-1 gene expression. After 8 hours of PN with lack of enteral feeding, MAdCAM-1 mRNA levels dropped 20% (0.8-fold vs chow, p &gt; .05); 5 days of PN reduced MAd-<e>CAM</e>-1 levels 64% (0.34-fold vs chow, p &lt; .05). PN reduced MAdCAM-1 protein levels by 30% (chow: 329 +/- 14 vs PN: 230 +/- 35, p &lt; .05) after 5 days. Fasting of uncannulated mice decreased MAdCAM-1 mRNA levels by 16% (0.84-fold, p &lt; .05) at day 1 and 30% (0.7-fold, p &lt; .05) by day 2 compared with chow. CONCLUSIONS: Both PN with lack of enteral feeding and fasting down-regulate MAdCAM-1 mRNA and protein levels in PP. The MAdCAM-1 changes are due to lack of enteral stimulation rather than toxic effects of PN.",M1
17187413,"Novel hepatic progenitor cell surface markers in the adult rat liver.Hepatic progenitor/oval cells appear in injured livers when hepatocyte proliferation is impaired. These cells can differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and could be useful for cell and gene therapy applications. In this work, we studied progenitor/oval cell surface markers in the liver of rats subjected to 2-acetylaminofluorene treatment followed by partial hepatectomy (2-AAF/PH) by using rat genome 230 2.0 Array chips and subsequent RT-PCR, immunofluorescent (IF), immunohistochemical (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses. We also studied expression of the identified novel cell surface markers in fetal rat liver progenitor cells and FAO-1 hepatoma cells. Novel cell surface markers in adult progenitor cells included tight junction proteins, integrins, cadherins, cell adhesion molecules, receptors, membrane channels and other transmembrane proteins. From the panel of 21 cell surface markers, 9 were overexpressed in fetal progenitor cells, 6 in FAO-1 cells and 6 are unique for the adult progenitors (CD133, claudin-7, cadherin 22, mucin-1, ros-1, Gabrp). The specificity of progenitor/oval cell surface markers was confirmed by ISH and double IF analyses. Moreover, study of progenitor cells purified with Ep-<e>CAM</e> antibodies from D-galactosamine injured rat liver, a noncarcinogenic model of progenitor cell activation, verified that progenitor cells expressed these markers. CONCLUSION: We identified novel cell surface markers specific for hepatic progenitor/oval cells, which offers powerful tool for their identification, isolation and studies of their physiology and pathophysiology. Our studies also reveal the mesenchymal/epithelial phenotype of these cells and the existence of species diversity in the hepatic progenitor cell identity.",M1
17182960,"Arterial aneurysms in HIV patients: molecular mimicry versus direct infection?There is growing literature on the subject of aneurysmal degeneration of arteries in patients who are infected with HIV. A patient recently seen at our medical center with an aneurysm of the carotid artery stimulated our interest in reviewing the mechanisms by which HIV may initiate or predispose to these pathologies. There are at least three major possibilities: (1) immunodeficiency allows bacteria that are known to cause mycotic aneurysms to proliferate without immune restraint; (2) one or more of the HIV envelope proteins sufficiently resemble one or more artery-specific-antigenic proteins (ASAPs) that may trigger an autoimmune response (molecular mimicry); and (3) the HIV virus itself infects arterial-resident cells that maintain the integrity of the load-bearing matrix. The computational searches reported here suggest that the ASAP, matrix cell adhesion molecule-1 (Mat-<e>CAM</e>-1), has a high degree of similarity to known ligands for HIV envelope proteins gp41 and gp120. No similarities of Mat-CAM-1 to the HIV envelope glycoproteins were detected. Accordingly, among the possibilities for explaining the HIV/aneurysm connection, direct infection of aortic fibroblasts by the HIV virus is more likely to be the pathogenetic mechanism than the process of molecular mimicry.",M1
17182959,"Features and genomic origins of matrix cell adhesion molecules-1 and -2 expressed by fibroblasts of human aortic adventitial origin.Precursor mRNAs for proteins that we have called matrix cell adhesion molecules-1 and -2 (Mat-<e>CAM</e>-1 and Mat-CAM-2) were cloned from fibroblasts cultured from a specimen of human abdominal aorta. Both protein sequences have the unusual feature that there is an immunoglobulin kappa (Igkappa)-like domain at the N terminus and they are glycine/proline rich in the C-terminal domain. Antibodies were raised in rabbit against peptides synthesized for a specific unique sequence of Mat-CAM-1 and Mat-CAM-2, respectively (not detected in any other proteins referenced in GenBank). Both antibodies were immunoreactive with adventitial microfibrils of the aorta and some additional arteries. Mat-CAM-1 was detected in the common/internal iliac arteries, but it was not detected in the external iliac artery. Conversely, Mat-CAM-2 was conspicuous in the external iliac artery, but not the common/internal iliac arteries. Thus, these proteins show features of site-specific expression within the arterial tree. Computerized searches show that the genomic origins of Mat-CAM-1 and -2 are in the so-called nasopharnygocarcinoma (NPC) gene on chromosome 2, which is a putative oncogene. Expression of the two different gene products from the same genomic sequence requires shifts of reading frame. Further studies will be required to determine whether these proteins are prototypes for a larger family of tissue-specific matrix proteins arising from alternative transcriptions of the same genomic sequence.",M1
17143355,"The role of the cytokines and cell-adhesion molecules on the immunopathology of acute appendicitis.OBJECTIVE: To study the local expression of the proinflammatory cytokine such as interferon gamma and anti-inflammatory cytokine like interleukin-10 (IL-10) and their role in cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) expression on the surface of endothelial cell at the site of inflammation in acute appendicitis. The local expression of these cytokines and CAM was correlated with clinical findings to shed light on their role in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with acute appendicitis and 6 apparently normal appendices were removed incidentally from individuals presented with problems other than appendicitis, were included in this prospective study. They were attendant of the emergency room in Al-Khadhumiyah Teaching Hospital in Baghdad, from October 2003 to September 2004. Cell adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-l], ICAM-3 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) were detected by immunohistochemistry while IL-10 and interferon gamma were detected by in situ hybridization. The specimens were classified into 5 groups; early acute appendicitis, phlegmonous appendicitis, ulcero-phlegmonous appendicitis, and gangrenous appendicitis, and the fifth group included specimens that showed no histopathological changes, defined as histologically normal appendix. RESULTS: Intracellular adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-I, IL-10 and interferon gamma were expressed weakly in the control group, while ICAM-3 was not detected in the control group. The average score for ICAM-I, VCAM-1 and the percentage of cells expressing IL-l0 and interferon gamma were significantly higher in the patient groups when compared with the control group. Intracellular adhesion molecule-3 was expressed in the patient group. CONCLUSION: The kinetics of CAM expression were tightly correlated to the balance between IL-10 and interferon gamma especially after 12.5 hours from the first symptoms experienced by the patients. The interferon gamma was the main player and the most significant factor that leads to shifting of cases towards gangrenous appendicitis.",M1
16988242,"Gingipains from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 synergistically disrupt endothelial cell adhesion and can induce caspase-independent apoptosis.We have shown previously that gingipains from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 can induce cell detachment, cell adhesion molecule (<e>CAM</e>) cleavage, and apoptosis in endothelial cells; however, the specific roles of the individual gingipains are unclear. Using purified gingipains, we determined that each of the gingipains can cleave CAMs to varying degrees with differing kinetics. Kgp and HRgpA work together to quickly detach endothelial cells. Interestingly, in the absence of active caspases, both gingipain-active W83 extracts and purified HRgpA and RgpB induce apoptotic morphology, suggesting that the gingipains can induce both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis. Using z-VAD-FMK to inhibit Kgp activity and leupeptin to inhibit Rgp activity in gingipain-active W83 extracts, we investigated the relative significance of the synergistic role of the gingipains. z-VAD-FMK or leupeptin delayed, but did not inhibit, cell detachment induced by gingipain-active W83 extracts or purified gingipains. There was partial cleavage of N-cadherin and cleavage of VE-cadherin was not inhibited. Degradation of integrin beta1 was inhibited only in the presence of z-VAD-FMK. These results further clarify the role P. gingivalis plays in tissue destruction occurring in the periodontal pocket.",M1
16971804,"Antitumor activity of a dual cytokine/single-chain antibody fusion protein for simultaneous delivery of GM-CSF and IL-2 to Ep-<e>CAM</e> expressing tumor cells.Cytokine targeting to tumor-associated antigens via antibody cytokine fusion proteins has demonstrated potent antitumor activity in numerous animal models and has led to the clinical development of 2 antibody-interleukin-2 (IL-2) fusion proteins. We previously reported on the construction and in vitro properties of a  dual  cytokine fusion protein for simultaneous targeted delivery of human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2 to human tumors. The fusion protein is based on a heterodimerized core structure formed by human CH1 and Ckappa domains (heterominibody) with C-terminally fused human cytokines and N-terminally fused single-chain antibody fragments specific for the tumor-associated surface antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM). For testing the antitumor activity in syngeneic mouse xenograft models, we developed  dual cytokine heterominibodies  with murine cytokines (mDCH). mDCH fusion proteins and, as controls,  single cytokine heterominibodies  (SCH) carrying either murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) or murine IL-2 (mIL-2) were constructed, of which all retained the specific activities of cytokines and binding to the Ep-CAM antigen on human Ep-CAM transfected mouse colon carcinoma CT26-KSA cells. Over a 5-day treatment course, DCH fusion proteins induced significant inhibition of established pulmonary CT26-KSA metastases in immune-competent Balb/c mice at low daily doses of 1 mug of fusion protein per mouse. However, with the tested dosing schemes, antitumor activity of mDCH was largely independent of cytokine targeting to tumors as demonstrated by a control protein with mutated Ep-CAM binding sites. Single cytokine fusion proteins mSCH-GM-CSF and mSCH-IL-2 showed similar antitumor activity as the dual cytokine fusion protein mDCH, indicating that GM-CSF and IL-2 in one molecule did not significantly synergize in tumor rejection under our experimental conditions. Our results seem to contradict the notion that IL-2 and GM-CSF can synergize in antitumor activity and that with conventional dose regimens, their specific targeting to tumors, as tested here with 2 antibodies of different affinities, enhances their antitumor activity.",M1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary cultures of EC of human umbilical vein were obtained by EC culturing for 24-72 h with cytarabine (10 mcg/ml). They were investigated with phase-contrast microscopy, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Cytarabine effects manifested with EC-induced expression of cell surface P- and E-selectines and VCAM-1; ICAM-1 expression rapidly enhanced, leukocyte adhesion to endothelium also activates. CONCLUSION: Cytarabine, as a pathogenetic factor, induces proinflammatory alterations of the endothelium responsible for development of vascular complications in patients on cytostatic therapy.",M1
16916501,"Niacin affects cell adhesion molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in HepG2 cells.BACKGROUND: Beyond lipid-modifying actions, niacin lowers the risk of atherothrombotic events by lowering prothrombotic factors like fibrinogen. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is a potential factor for atherogenesis and thrombosis, increased in acute myocardial infarctions and restenosis after angioplasty. Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) mediate adhesion, recruitment and migration of white blood cells through vascular surfaces, an essential process in atherogenesis. ICAM-1 is a significant predictor of future coronary events. Whether niacin affects ICAM-1 expression is unknown. We studied the effects of niacin on PAI-1 and CAM using HepG2 cells. METHODS: HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM until 90% confluent. After serum starvation, cells were exposed to DME/F12 containing niacin. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was added directly to cell media. Cell lysate and conditioned media were collected for measurement of PAI-1 by ELISA. For measurement of ICAM, cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) instead. The effect of niacin on mRNA expression of ICAM-1 was studied using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Niacin reduced the TGF-beta-induced rise by 30% to 55% (p=0.002). The differences in degree of PAI-1 reduction, between different niacin concentrations, were not statistically significant. Niacin reduced TNF-alpha-induced rise in ICAM-1 levels by 66% to 89% (p&lt;0.0001), but did not significantly affect TNF-alpha-induced rise in PECAM-1. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that reduced TNF-alpha-induced rise in ICAM-1 mRNA expression significantly by 17% (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with niacin suppressed PAI-1 and ICAM-1 levels in HepG2 cells. Further studies to understand the mechanistic pathways of this suppression, could further explain benefits of niacin in prevention of atherosclerotic disease, and offer therapeutic avenues against the rising burden of atherothrombotic disease.",M1
16798617,"Hypoxia and ionizing radiation: changes in adhesive properties and cell adhesion molecule expression in MG-63 three-dimensional tumor spheroids.The effects of chemically induced hypoxia and ionizing radiation on the adhesive properties of MG-63 human osteosarcoma three-dimensional spheroids were investigated. Hypoxia was induced by addition of CoCl2 to small, nonhypoxic spheroids and verified by HIF-1alpha expression. In addition, the possible role of important cell adhesion molecules involved in tumor dissemination in inducing adhesive changes were also studied. In particular, two key integrins (i.e., the alpha chain of the fibronectin receptor, alpha5, and the alpha chain of the collagen receptor, alpha2), an important member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (CD54 or ICAM-1) and the strategic molecule CD44 (H-<e>CAM</e>, the principal receptor for hyaluronan) were examined. Because of the important role of fibronectin in adhesive processes, variations in this extracellular matrix component were also examined. The results seem to indicate that CoCl2-induced hypoxia greatly increases adhesion of MG-63 spheroids to both tissue culture plates and plates coated with fibronectin or collagen when compared to controls, while ionizing radiation induces a great decrease in this attachment. Furthermore, chemically induced hypoxia also partially inhibits the effects of ionizing radiation. The data also show that these adhesive changes are accompanied by concomitant variations in the expression of alpha5 and alpha2 integrins, CD44, and CD54 and fibronectin.",M1

METHODS: The Ep-CAM expression was immunohistochemically investigated in 70 primary esophageal SCCs using the monoclonal antibody Ber-EP4. For the interpretation of the staining results, we used a standardized scoring system ranging from 0 to 3+. The survival analysis was calculated from 53 patients without distant metastasis, with R0 resection and at least 2 months of clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Ep-CAM neo-expression was observed in 79% of the tumors with three expression levels, 1+ (26%), 2+ (11%) and 3+ (41%). Heterogeneous expression was observed at all expression levels. Interestingly, tumors with 3+ Ep-CAM expression conferred a significantly decreased median relapse-free survival period (log rank, p = 0.0001) and median overall survival (log rank, p = 0.0003). Multivariate survival analysis disclosed Ep-CAM 3+ expression as independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest Ep-CAM as an attractive molecule for targeted therapy in esophageal SCC. Considering the discontenting results of the current adjuvant concepts for esophageal SCC patients, Ep-CAM might provide a promising target for an adjuvant immunotherapeutic intervention.",M1
16775119,"Ep-<e>CAM</e> expression in pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas: frequency and prognostic relevance.AIMS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy with only a few long-term survivors even after radical surgery. Patients with ampullary cancer have a better prognosis but adjuvant therapy needs further improvement. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) is strongly expressed in a variety of epithelial cancers and represents a promising target for immunological tumour therapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate Ep-CAM expression and its potential prognostic impact in pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas. METHODS: Ep-CAM expression was investigated retrospectively by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded primary tumour tissue samples from a series of consecutive patients with pancreatic (n = 153) and ampullary cancer (n = 34). RESULTS: Ep-CAM overexpression was observed in 85 of 153 pancreatic cancer specimens (56%) and in 29 of 34 ampullary cancer samples (85%). Overall, Ep-CAM failed to be an independent prognostic marker. However, subgroup analyses showed that Ep-CAM overexpression correlated with shorter overall survival among patients with ampullary cancer and advanced stage pancreatic cancer. In the latter subgroup, survival gradually worsened with increasing Ep-CAM scores. Furthermore, in ampullary cancer, Ep-CAM overexpression was found to correlate with tumour stage. CONCLUSIONS: Ep-CAM overexpression was detectable in the majority of cases with pancreatic and ampullary cancer. Therefore, Ep-CAM represents an attractive target for immune-based therapeutic interventions in these tumour entities. However, the prognostic value of Ep-CAM overexpression remains undetermined.",M1
16769766,"Tripterine inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules in activated endothelial cells.Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) expressed by vascular endothelium in response to cytokine stimulation play a key role in leukocyte adhesion to endothelium during the inflammatory response. Tripterine, a chemical compound of the Chinese plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f, displays anti-inflammatory properties in several animal models. However, mechanisms of its action are poorly understood. In the present study, we show that in inflammatory conditions, mimicked by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation, pretreatment for 6 h with tripterine at nontoxic concentrations of 20-200 nM inhibits the expression of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (CAM)-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a dose-dependent manner. Tripterine (200 nM) almost completely inhibits expression of VCAM-1 [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 52 nM] and ICAM-1 (IC50 = 51 nM) and 73% of E-selectin (IC50 = 94 nM). This inhibition effect is prominent, compared with that of dexamethasone, ibuprofen, methotrexate, or probucol, which revealed a much weaker inhibition at doses as high as 1 mM. Effects on endothelial CAM of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma, were also inhibited significantly by tripterine. Moreover, significant inhibition was equally observable in postincubation experiments. In addition, tripterine inhibited adhesion of human monocytes and T lymphocytes to TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVEC. Finally, tripterine inhibited TNF-alpha-driven CAM mRNA transcription and nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear (NF-kappaB) translocation. Hence, we describe a new mechanism of tripterine's anti-inflammatory action obtained at nanomolar concentrations, owing to the negative regulation of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression and adhesiveness in human endothelium.",M1
16720322,"Cell adhesion molecules at the synapse.Synapses are specialized intercellular junctions whose specificity and plasticity provide the structural and functional basis for the formation and maintenance of the complex neural network in the brain. The number, location, and type of synapses formed are well controlled, since synaptic circuits are formed in a highly reproducible way. This implies the existence of cellular and molecular properties that determine the connectivity of each neuron in the nervous system. Recent evidence has elucidated that these key features of the synapse are regulated by several families of cell-adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) enriched at synaptic junctions, including neuroligins, SynCAM, NCAM, L1-CAM, cadherins, protocadherins, and integrins. In this review we will discuss the various stages of synaptogenesis from the perspective of CAMs: Contact initiation, recruitment of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, synapse maturation/stabilization or elimination, and synaptic plasticity. We will also highlight some of the factors that regulate the function of these CAMs at the synapse, and discuss how dysfunction of these adhesive systems may contribute to several neurological disorders.",M1
16678891,"Overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) is an independent prognostic marker for reduced survival of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.OBJECTIVE: Currently available clinical and molecular factors provide still an insufficient prognostic and predictive assessment for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). To identify a potential molecular target and prognostic/predictive factor for EOC, we investigated in a retrospective study the prognostic value of Ep-CAM overexpression in EOC. METHODS: We assessed by immunohistochemistry the expression of the Ep-CAM antigen on tissue microarrays containing paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 199 patients with documented EOC. Patients were operated for ovarian cancer in the period between June 1980 and January 2000. RESULTS: We observed a rate of Ep-CAM overexpression of 68.8%. Ep-CAM overexpression was significantly related to a decreased overall survival (P = 0.036). The prognostic power of Ep-CAM overexpression was particularly strong in patients with stage III and IV disease. In fact, in this subgroup, median overall survival was twofold higher in patients without as compared to patients with Ep-CAM overexpression (46 vs. 23 months, P &lt; 0.01). Univariate analysis revealed a correlation with histologic grade. We observed a significantly higher rate of Ep-CAM overexpression (83.5%) in grade 3 tumors. Histologic subtypes associated with a higher rate of Ep-CAM overexpression were serous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. Cox regression analysis showed Ep-CAM overexpression to be an independent prognostic marker (P = 0.037, RR = 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis demonstrates for the first time an independent prognostic value of Ep-CAM overexpression in patients with EOC. Ovarian cancer patients with Ep-CAM overexpressing tumors are frequent and would qualify for treatment with Ep-CAM-specific immunotherapeutic approaches.",M1
16670268,"Alpha-4 integrins and VCAM-1, but not MAdCAM-1, are essential for recruitment of mast cell progenitors to the inflamed lung.Normal mouse lungs lack appreciable numbers of mast cells (MCs) or MC progenitors (MCp's), yet the appearance of mature MCs in the tracheobronchial epithelial surface is a characteristic of allergic, T-cell-dependent pulmonary inflammation. We hypothesized that pulmonary inflammation would recruit MCp's to inflamed lungs and that this recruitment would be regulated by distinct adhesion pathways. Ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged mice had a greater than 28-fold increase in the number of MCp's in the lungs. In mice lacking endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and in wild-type mice administered blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) to VCAM-1 but not to mucosal addressin <e>CAM</e>-1 (MadCAM-1), recruitment of MCp's to the inflamed lung was reduced by greater than 75%. Analysis of the integrin receptors for VCAM-1 showed that in beta7 integrin-deficient mice, recruitment was reduced 73% relative to wild-type controls, and in either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice, mAb blocking of alpha4, beta1, or beta7 integrins inhibited the recruitment of MCp's to the inflamed lung. Thus, VCAM-1 interactions with both alpha4beta1 and alpha4beta7 integrins are essential for the recruitment and expansion of the MCp populations in the lung during antigen-induced pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, the MCp is currently unique among inflammatory cells in its partial dependence on alpha4beta7 integrins for lung recruitment.",M1
16626807,"Breaking up the tie: disintegrin-like metalloproteinases as regulators of cell migration in inflammation and invasion.Cell adhesion and cell migration are essential for a variety of important events in both embryonic development and in the adult organism. Cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) like selectins, immunoglobulin superfamily members, integrins, and cadherins undergo diverse mechanisms of regulation. Dysregulation of adhesion can lead to pathological processes, including inflammatory diseases or tumor metastasis either by disrupting the normal anchorage, thereby altering cell movement and regulatory signalling, or by promoting inappropriate temporal and spatial adhesion. An increasing body of evidence has emerged showing that members of the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family critically contribute to the regulation of CAM functions. While the disintegrin domain can interact with integrins and mediate adhesion, the metalloproteinase domain can mediate anti-adhesive functions by cleaving the membrane bound adhesion molecules. This  shedding  process leads to the release of often still functional soluble ectodomains and can additionally influence intracellular cell signalling pathways. Several soluble CAMs have been detected in vitro and in vivo. Some of them are strongly increased in inflammatory diseases or in the serum of cancer patients. Therefore the level of soluble CAMs but also the expression of the metalloproteinases responsible for their release might provide prognostic information. It could also be useful for monitoring malignant disease stages and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches. Moreover, metalloproteases of the ADAM family are emerging as promising targets for new therapeutic options.",M1
16624485,"Methylation status of the Ep-<e>CAM</e> promoter region in human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue.We examined the methylation status of the Ep-CAM promoter region of human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue using MethyLight technology and bisulfite sequencing. We found the promoter of Ep-CAM-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs 578T to be methylated to a higher degree as compared to positive cell lines MCF-7. Demethylation of cell lines was performed using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Ep-CAM RNA and protein expression could be partially restored by treating cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In most primary breast cancer tissue, methylation of the Ep-CAM gene could be detected at a low level and no correlation was found with Ep-CAM protein expression in tumour tissue. Taken together, these data suggest that methylation of the Ep-CAM promoter is not a crucial mechanism for regulation of Ep-CAM expression in breast cancer. Thus, most important regulatory mechanisms have to be supposed in vivo.",M1
16619291,"Genetic vaccines against Ep-<e>CAM</e> break tolerance to self in a limited subset of subjects: initial identification of predictive biomarkers.The epithelial cell adhesion molecule, Ep-CAM, has been historically considered a target of passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies, and more recently, of a first Pox-vector-based cancer vaccine Phase I trial in colorectal cancer patients. To shed further light on the use of this antigen, we isolated the mouse and rhesus homologues of human Ep-CAM and explored different genetic vaccination modalities based on the use of adenoviral vectors as well as DNA electroporation (DNA-EP). Immune responses to Ep-CAM were measured by IFN-gamma ELISPOT and intracellular staining assays using overlapping sets of peptides covering the entire coding regions. We found the most powerful vaccination regimen to be constituted by DNA-EP-prime/Adeno-boost mixed-modality protocols. Vaccination in rhesus macaques resulted in breakage of immunological tolerance in a minority of cases. Similarly, a low frequency of responders was observed with the mouse Ep-CAM vaccine in outbred CD1 mice. When immunized CD1 mice were analyzed for MHC haplotype and TCR expression levels, we observed that immune responders all had the same q/q MHC class I haplotype and showed higher expression levels of the TCRVbeta4 and TCRVbeta8 T cell receptors. Our results underscore the current limitations in our capacity to induce efficient cancer vaccines against self antigens like Ep-CAM, but also represent a first effort to identify predictive biomarkers of response.",M1
16607281,"Requirement of nectin, but not cadherin, for formation of claudin-based tight junctions in annexin II-knockdown MDCK cells.Adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) comprise a junctional complex which plays key roles not only in cell adhesion and polarization but also in regulation of cell movement and proliferation in epithelial cells. E-Cadherin and nectin are major cell-cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) at AJs, whereas claudin is a major CAM at TJs. We have shown that the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion is not formed in MDCK cells in which annexin II, a Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-binding protein, is knocked down. Here, we found that TJs and the nectin-based cell-cell adhesions were formed in annexin II-knockdown cells. The formation of TJs in annexin II-knockdown MDCK cells required the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion and afadin, a nectin- and actin-filament-binding protein. In addition, it required the activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins and subsequent reorganization of the IQGAP1-dependent actin cytoskeleton which were induced by the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion. These results indicate that the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion and afadin, but not the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion, are necessary for the formation of TJs and that the signaling by nectin and the subsequent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton are also necessary for the formation of TJs under certain conditions.",M1
16566914,"Neurofascin interactions play a critical role in clustering sodium channels, ankyrin G and beta IV spectrin at peripheral nodes of Ranvier.The Ig cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>) neurofascin (NF) and Nr-CAM are localized at developing nodes of Ranvier in peripheral myelinated axons prior to clustering of Na+ channels. Different isoforms of NF are expressed on neurons and glia, and NF binding on both cells has been suggested to play roles in node and paranode formation. To clarify the role of NF further, we analyzed effects of NF-Fc fusion proteins in Schwann cell-DRG neuron myelinating cocultures. NF-Fc significantly inhibited nodal clustering of Na+ channels, ankyrin G, and betaIV spectrin, and modestly reduced Caspr clustering at paranodal junctions; it did not significantly affect lengths or numbers of myelin-positive segments, axon initial segments, or accumulations of phosphorylated-ERM proteins in Schwann cell nodal microvilli. NF-Fc binds to Schwann cells but little or no binding to DRG neurons was detected. The results suggest a critical early role for axonal NF in clustering of Na+ channels at nodes of Ranvier via interactions with receptors on Schwann cells.",M1
16546822,"Review: Lutheran/B-<e>CAM</e>: a laminin receptor on red blood cells and in various tissues.The Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu), also known as basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM), is a transmembrane receptor with five immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region; it is therefore classified as a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene family. Lu/B-CAM is observed not only on red blood cells, but also on a subset of muscle and epithelial cells in various tissues. Recently, several groups have reported that Lu/B-CAM is a novel receptor for laminin a5. The laminin a5 chain is a component of the laminin-511 (alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 1), -521 (alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 1), and -523 (alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 3) heterotrimers and is expressed throughout the mammalian body. We also have shown that Lu/B-CAM is co-localized with laminin alpha 5 in various tissues. Although the biological role of Lu/B-CAM remains unclear, the specific binding of Lu/B-CAM to laminin alpha 5 suggests that it plays an important role in developmental and physiological processes. It also is necessary to investigate further the interaction between Lu/B-CAM and laminin a5 in pathological processes, including sickle cell disease and cancer.",M1
16525993,"Cross-linking tumor cells with effector cells via CD55 with a bispecific mAb induces beta-glucan-dependent CR3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.Complement (C) regulatory proteins decrease the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic anti-cancer antibodies. Bispecific mAb (bi-mAb) that target a tumor antigen and simultaneously inhibit a C regulator increase the effectiveness of such a therapy. Here we investigated the mechanism by which bi-mAb increase tumor cell lysis. Apart from C-dependent cytotoxicity, C activation can lead to complement receptor 3 (CR3)-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CR3-DCC) by CR3-positive effector cells in the presence of beta-glucan. Here we show that an anti-Ep-<e>CAM</e>*anti-CD55 bi-mAb induced more than threefold higher CR3-DCC (71%) of human colorectal cancer cells compared with anti-Ep-CAM alone (20%). This CR3-DCC was dependent on the binding of the anti-CD55 arm of tumor-bound anti-Ep-CAM*anti-CD55 bi-mAb to effector cell CD55, CR3 priming by beta-glucan and the presence of iC3b on the target cell. Comparable lysis could be obtained in the absence of iC3b, when CR3 and CD55 were cross-linked on the effector cells, suggesting cooperation between CD55 and CR3 in signal transduction. Tumor cells with low antigen expression were effectively lysed via this mechanism in contrast to direct C-dependent cytotoxicity. These data imply that the effectiveness of mAb immunotherapy can be improved using anti-tumor antigen*anti-CD55 bi-mAb and beta-glucan, thereby initiating CR3-DCC as an additional effector mechanism that is efficient for eradication of tumor cells with lower antigen expression.",M1
16507899,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) potentiates leukocyte recruitment to inflammation by enhancing endothelial adhesion molecule expression.Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) is a potent angiogenic factor and endothelial cell mitogen. Although bFGF levels are increased in chronically inflamed tissue, its role in inflammation is unclear. We investigated the effect of bFGF on acute dermal inflammation and the recruitment of monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils. Leukocyte recruitment to inflamed sites was quantified with radiolabeled leukocytes. Intradermal injection of bFGF in rats did not induce leukocyte recruitment or inflammation. However, the recruitment of leukocytes to inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, C5a, or a delayed hypersensitivity reaction was enhanced by bFGF by 55 to 132% (P &lt; 0.05). Either acute or prolonged bFGF treatment of dermal sites had this effect. The potentiating effect of bFGF on leukocyte recruitment was also seen in joints. There was no associated modulation of vascular permeability, blood flow, or angiogenesis in the sites by bFGF. However, the expression of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) for leukocytes, P-selectin, E-selectin, and ICAM-1, was significantly up-regulated in the inflamed tissue by bFGF, as quantified by radiolabeled anti-CAM antibody binding in vivo. Thus, although not directly proinflammatory, bFGF synergistically potentiates inflammatory mediator-induced leukocyte recruitment, at least in part, by enhancing CAM up-regulation on endothelium.",M1

In this study, we have assessed the time frames of pretreatment and of the duration of the preconditioned state using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the NO donor, SNAP, in combination with cysteine. The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and E-selectin by the cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1beta, and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was reduced by SNAP/Cys preincubation (30 min, 1mM) to less than 10% of controls. This refractory state in respect to cytokine-induced CAM expression persisted for 6h after washout of the NO donor in the combination TNFalpha/VCAM, and a partial block was still observed after 8h. The effect was not mediated by the cGMP pathway, as was demonstrated by using the inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase, ODQ, and the cGMP analogue, 8-Br-cGMP. The TNFalpha-induced expression of CAM was exclusively dependent on the transcription factor NFkappaB since the inhibitor of NFkappaB activation, BAY 11-7082, completely blocked the induction. The TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaBalpha) was suppressed for up to 8h after SNAP/Cys pretreatment. The inhibitory S-nitrosation of IkappaB kinase (IKKbeta), as assessed by the biotin-switch-procedure and immunoprecipitation, was only detectable immediately after SNAP/Cys incubation but not at later time points. In summary, a short preincubation of HUVEC with SNAP/Cys results in a persistent suppression of NFkappaB-dependent expression of CAM. The stabilization of IkappaBalpha over the same time span may be causally related to this effect.",M1
16504338,"Regulation of neuronal PKA signaling through AKAP targeting dynamics.Central to organization of signaling pathways are scaffolding, anchoring and adaptor proteins that mediate localized assembly of multi-protein complexes containing receptors, second messenger-generating enzymes, kinases, phosphatases, and substrates. At the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses, AMPA (AMPAR) and NMDA (NMDAR) glutamate receptors are linked to signaling proteins, the actin cytoskeleton, and synaptic adhesion molecules on dendritic spines through a network of scaffolding proteins that may play important roles regulating synaptic structure and receptor functions in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. AMPARs are rapidly recruited to dendritic spines through NMDAR activation during induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) through pathways that also increase the size and F-actin content of spines. Phosphorylation of AMPAR-GluR1 subunits by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) helps stabilize AMPARs recruited during LTP. In contrast, induction of long-term depression (LTD) leads to rapid calcineurin-protein phosphatase 2B (CaN) mediated dephosphorylation of PKA-phosphorylated GluR1 receptors, endocytic removal of AMPAR from synapses, and a reduction in spine size. However, mechanisms for coordinately regulating AMPAR localization, phosphorylation, and synaptic structure by PKA and CaN are not well understood. A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) 79/150 is a PKA- and CaN-anchoring protein that is linked to NMDARs and AMPARs through PSD-95 and SAP97 membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffolds. Importantly, disruption of PKA-anchoring in neurons and functional analysis of GluR1-MAGUK-AKAP79 complexes in heterologous cells suggests that AKAP79/150-anchored PKA and CaN may regulate AMPARs in LTD. In the work presented at the  First International Meeting on Anchored cAMP Signaling Pathways  (Berlin-Buch, Germany, October 15-16, 2005), we demonstrate that AKAP79/150 is targeted to dendritic spines by an N-terminal basic region that binds phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), F-actin, and actin-linked cadherin adhesion molecules. Thus, anchoring of PKA and CaN as well as physical linkage of the AKAP to both cadherin-cytoskeletal and MAGUK-receptor complexes could play roles in coordinating changes in synaptic structure and receptor signaling functions underlying plasticity. Importantly, we provide evidence showing that NMDAR-CaN signaling pathways implicated in AMPAR regulation during LTD lead to a disruption of AKAP79/150 interactions with actin, MAGUKs, and cadherins and lead to a loss of the AKAP and anchored PKA from postsynapses. Our studies thus far indicate that this AKAP79/150 translocation depends on activation of CaN, F-actin reorganization, and possibly Ca(2+)-<e>CaM</e> binding to the N-terminal basic regions. Importantly, this tranlocation of the AKAP79/150-PKA complex from spines may shift the balance of PKA kinase and CaN/PP1 phosphatase activity at the postsynapse in favor of the phosphatases. This loss of PKA could then promote actions of CaN and PP1 during induction of LTD including maintaining AMPAR dephosphorylation, promoting AMPAR endocytosis, and preventing AMPAR recycling. Overall, these findings challenge the accepted notion that AKAPs are static anchors that position signaling proteins near fixed target substrates and instead suggest that AKAPs can function in more dynamic manners to regulate local signaling events.",M1
16483188,"A human cytokine/single-chain antibody fusion protein for simultaneous delivery of GM-CSF and IL-2 to Ep-<e>CAM</e> overexpressing tumor cells.Pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the growth, differentiation, and activation of immune cells and can play a role in antitumor responses. GM-CSF and IL-2 induce tumor rejection in animal models when expressed by tumor cells, and IL-2 is used for the treatment of melanoma and renal cell cancer. However, high doses of GM-CSF and IL-2 are associated with severe side effects in cancer patients. We generated a dual cytokine fusion protein for simultaneous targeted delivery of human GM-CSF and IL-2 to human tumors. The fusion protein is based on a heterodimeric core structure formed by human CH1 and C kappa domains (heterominibody) with C-terminally fused human cytokines and N-terminally fused human single-chain Ab fragments (scFv) specific for the tumor-associated surface antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM). The dual cytokine heterominibody (DCH) was well expressed and secreted by CHO cells, preserved the specific proliferative activities of the two cytokines, and showed Ep-CAM-specific binding to tumor cells. DCH induced potent tumor cell lysis in vitro by two distinct mechanisms. One was activating PBMCs to lyse tumor cells, which was superior to cytotoxicity induced by equimolar ratios of free recombinant human IL-2 and GM-CSF. The other mechanism was redirected lysis, as seen with isolated human T cells, which was solely dependent on the IL-2 fusion part. The therapeutic principle of dual cytokine targeting may warrant in vivo testing of murine-specific analogues in appropriate mouse models and further preclinical development of the less immunogenic, human cytokine- and human Ep-CAM-specific DCH molecule described here.",M1
16479603,"Immune surveillance of the human central nervous system (CNS): different migration pathways of immune cells through the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in healthy persons.BACKGROUND: Since for immune surveillance, only lymphocytes in the activated state are able to enter normal human central nervous system (CNS), available data are briefly reviewed to reveal lymphocyte transfer through blood-brain barrier (bbb) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (bCSFb). METHODS: With immuno-histochemical and -cytochemical methods, bbb was studied on brain microvessels and bCSFb on choroid plexus epithelium and microvessels. Lymphocyte transfer capacity on the barriers was determined with blood/CSF cell ratios revealed by quantified multicolour flow-cytometry of CSF and blood sample pairs. RESULTS: Four paths attenuated the restricted transfer of lymphocyte and NK cell subsets (none for B cells) through bbb and bCSFb, preferring memory cells in normal human brain, using different cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>). CAM pattern changed in choroid plexus where indication of lymphocyte recirculating from CSF into blood may exist in animal brains. CONCLUSIONS: Since efficiency of migration of blood-borne lymphocytes into CSF across bbb or bCSFb of normal human brain is not fully revealed, further data are needed to understand the transfer of immune cells across the barriers in health and disease.",M1
16469869,"ICAM-2 mediates neutrophil transmigration in vivo: evidence for stimulus specificity and a role in PECAM-1-independent transmigration.ICAM-2 has been implicated in leukocyte transmigration in vitro, but there is little in vivo evidence to support this. To address this, neutrophil migration was investigated in ICAM-2-deficient mice (KO) and in wild-type (WT) mice treated with an anti-ICAM-2 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) (3C4). In a peritonitis model, IL-1beta-induced accumulation of neutrophils was significantly reduced in mice treated with 3C4 (51% inhibition) and in KO mice (41% inhibition). In contrast, TNF-alpha- or thioglycolate-induced responses were not suppressed in KO mice. Analysis of IL-1beta-induced leukocyte responses in cremasteric venules of KO animals by intravital microscopy indicated a defect in transmigration (44% inhibition) but not rolling or adhesion. As found before, TNF-alpha-induced leukocyte transmigration was unaltered in the KO mice. WT mice treated with the anti-ICAM-2 mAb also exhibited a selective reduction in leukocyte transmigration in response to IL-1beta while an anti-ICAM-1 mAb inhibited both leukocyte adhesion and transmigration. Interestingly, mAb 3C4 significantly suppressed IL-1beta-induced neutrophil transmigration in PE-<e>CAM</e>-1 KO animals in the peritonitis model but not in the cremaster muscle. The findings provide direct evidence for the involvement of ICAM-2 in neutrophil transmigration in vivo, though this role appears to be stimulus specific. Furthermore, ICAM-2 appears capable of mediating PECAM-1-independent leukocyte transmigration.",M1
16467180,"Profiling of the tetraspanin web of human colon cancer cells.Tetraspanins are integral membrane proteins involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, clinical and experimental studies have reported a link between tetraspanin expression levels and metastasis. Tetraspanins play a role as organizers of multimolecular complexes in the plasma membrane. Indeed each tetraspanin associates specifically with one or a few other membrane proteins forming primary complexes. Thus, tetraspanin-tetraspanin associations lead to a molecular network of interactions, the  tetraspanin web.  We performed a proteomic characterization of the tetraspanin web using a model of human colon cancer consisting of three cell lines derived from the primary tumor and two metastases (hepatic and peritoneal) from the same patient. The tetraspanin complexes were isolated after immunoaffinity purification using monoclonal antibodies directed against the tetraspanin CD9, and the associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry using LC-MS/MS. This allowed the identification of 32 proteins including adhesion molecules (integrins, proteins with Ig domains, CD44, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule) (EpCAM), membrane proteases (ADAM10, TADG-15, and CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV), and signaling proteins (heterotrimeric G proteins). Importantly some components were differentially detected in the tetraspanin web of the three cell lines: the laminin receptor Lutheran/B-cell adhesion molecule (Lu/B-<e>CAM</e>) was expressed only on the primary tumor cells, whereas CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV and tetraspanin Co-029 were observed only on metastatic cells. Concerning Co-029, immunohistofluorescence showed a high expression of Co-029 on epithelial cells in normal colon and a lower expression in tumors, whereas heterogeneity in terms of expression level was observed on metastasis. Finally we demonstrated that epithelial cell adhesion molecule and CD9 form a new primary complex in the tetraspanin web.",M1
16404366,"Frequent high-level expression of the immunotherapeutic target Ep-<e>CAM</e> in colon, stomach, prostate and lung cancers.Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM; CD326) is used as a target by many immunotherapeutic approaches, but little data are available about Ep-CAM expression in major human malignancies with respect to level, frequency, tumour stage, grade, histologic tumour type and impact on survival. We analysed by immunohistochemical staining tissue microarrays with 4046 primary human carcinoma samples from colon, stomach, prostate and lung cancers for both frequency and intensity of Ep-CAM expression under highly standardised conditions. A total of 3360 samples were analysable. High-level Ep-CAM expression was observed in 97.7% (n=1186) of colon, 90.7% of gastric (n=473), and 87.2% of prostate cancers (n=414), and in 63.9% of lung cancers (n=1287). No detectable Ep-CAM staining was found with only 0.4% of colon, 2.5% of gastric, 1.9% of prostate cancers, and 13.5% of lung cancers. The only significant correlation of Ep-CAM expression with tumour grading was observed in colon cancer where high-level Ep-CAM expression on grade 3 tumours was down to 92.1% (P&lt;0.0001). Adenosquamous and squamous carcinomas of the lung had a lower percentage of high-level Ep-CAM expression compared to adenocarcinomas with 35.4 and 53.6%, respectively, and with 45.5 and 17.3% of tumours being Ep-CAM negative. With the exception of moderately differentiated colon carcinoma, where patients not expressing Ep-CAM on their tumours showed an inferior survival (P=0.0014), correlation of Ep-CAM expression with survival did not reach statistical significance for any of the other cancer indications and subgroups. In conclusion, the data strongly support the notion that Ep-CAM is a prime target for immunotherapies in major human malignancies. This is because the most common human cancers show (i) a low frequency of Ep-CAM-negative tumours, (ii) a high frequency of Ep-CAM expression on cells of a given tumour, and (iii) for most cancers, an insignificant influence of tumour staging, grading and histology on Ep-CAM expression.",M1
16357171,"The shed ectodomain of Nr-<e>CAM</e> stimulates cell proliferation and motility, and confers cell transformation.Nr-CAM, a cell-cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule family, known for its function in neuronal outgrowth and guidance, was recently identified as a target gene of beta-catenin signaling in human melanoma and colon carcinoma cells and tissue. Retrovirally mediated transduction of Nr-CAM into fibroblasts induces cell motility and tumorigenesis. We investigated the mechanisms by which Nr-CAM can confer properties related to tumor cell behavior and found that Nr-CAM expression in NIH3T3 cells protects cells from apoptosis in the absence of serum by constitutively activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT signaling pathways. We detected a metalloprotease-mediated shedding of Nr-CAM into the culture medium of cells transfected with Nr-CAM, and of endogenous Nr-CAM in B16 melanoma cells. Conditioned medium and purified Nr-CAM-Fc fusion protein both enhanced cell motility, proliferation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT activation. Moreover, Nr-CAM was found in complex with alpha4beta1 integrins in melanoma cells, indicating that it can mediate, in addition to homophilic cell-cell adhesion, heterophilic adhesion with extracellular matrix receptors. Suppression of Nr-CAM levels by small interfering RNA in B16 melanoma inhibited the adhesive and tumorigenic capacities of these cells. Stable expression of the Nr-CAM ectodomain in NIH3T3 cells conferred cell transformation and tumorigenesis in mice, suggesting that the metalloprotease-mediated shedding of Nr-CAM is a principal route for promoting oncogenesis by Nr-CAM.",M1
16321827,"Immunophenotypic profile and role of adhesion molecules in splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow involvement.Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL), with or without villous lymphocytes (VL+/-), is a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder with constant involvement of the bone marrow (BM). Different BM infiltration patterns, mainly intra-sinusoidal, interstitial and nodular, have been described. Adhesion molecules (AMs) constitute a heterogeneous group of antigenic receptors playing a major role in leukocyte recruitment, in lymphocyte homing and in cellular-mediated immune response. Evolution and pattern of the BM infiltrate could be influenced by a variable expression of AM on SMZL lymphocytes. The degree and pattern of BM infiltration and the immunohistochemical expression of AM (H-<e>CAM</e>, BL-CAM, L-selectin, PSGL-1, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and Beta-1 integrin) among the different infiltration patterns were evaluated in BM biopsies of 38 patients with SMZL and graded according to a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0-4 and based on the percentage of positive cells. An intra-sinusoidal infiltration was constantly observed, alone or in conjunction with other patterns. H-CAM and BL-CAM showed a moderate-to-high degree of positivity in the intra-sinusoidal infiltrate (median expression grade-3) and were expressed in the neoplastic lymphocytes independently from the pattern. PSGL-1 was mostly expressed in the perisinusoidal region and in case of interstitial infiltration (grade-2). ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were selectively expressed in the nodules as a reticular meshwork located in the core region (grade-2); VCAM-1 was also expressed in the perinodular endothelia. E-selectin, L-selectin and beta-1 integrin proved constantly negative. These data suggest that different expression of AM can influence the modality of BM infiltration in SMZL.",M1
16308137,"Effect of glutamine on cell adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte transmigration in endothelial cells stimulated by preeclamptic plasma.OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed plasma glutamine (GLN) concentrations in women with preeclampsia. Also, in an in vitro study we evaluated whether GLN concentration was related to surface molecule expressions on endothelial cells (ECs) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and the transendothelial migration of PMNs through ECs stimulated by preeclamptic plasma. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 20 women with preeclampsia and 15 normal pregnant women for plasma GLN analysis. In the in vitro study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and PMNs were treated with different concentrations (0, 300, 500, and 1000 microM) of GLN for 24 h. After that, we stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells for 3 h with plasma from patients with preeclampsia, and PMNs were allowed to transmigrate through ECs for 2 h. EC surface expressions of cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) and integrin (CD11b) interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor expressions on PMNs were measured by flow cytometry. The transendothelial migration of PMNs through ECs was also analyzed. RESULTS: Women with preeclampsia exhibited significantly lower plasma GLN concentrations than did normal pregnant women. The in vitro study showed that, compared with normal plasma, CAM expressions on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and PMNs were increased when preeclamptic plasma was stimulated. Among the groups with preeclamptic plasma stimulation, intracellular CAM-1 expression on ECs and CD11b and IL-8 receptor expressions on PMNs were lower with 500 and 1000 microM than with 300 microM of GLN. IL-8 production from ECs and PMNs was also lower with 500 and 1000 microM than with 300 microM of GLN. PMN transmigration was significantly higher with 300 microM of GLN than with the other GLN concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma GLN is depleted in women with preeclampsia. The result of this in vitro study showed that ECs and PMNs were activated after preeclamptic plasma stimulation. A low GLN concentration resulted in greater CAM expression and greater transendothelial migration of neutrophils. GLN administration at levels similar to or higher than physiologic concentrations decreased IL-8 and CAM expressions, and PMN transmigration decreased after stimulation with preeclamptic plasma.",M1
16302733,"Preparation of human IgG and IgM monoclonal antibodies for MK-1/Ep-<e>CAM</e> by using human immunoglobulin gene-transferred mouse and gene cloning of their variable regions.For antibody-based therapy of cancer, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of human origin are superior to mouse, mouse/human chimeric or humanized mAbs, because of their minimum immunogenicity to humans and their efficient collaboration with human effector cells. In the present study, human mAbs were prepared against a pancarcinoma antigen, MK-1 (Ep-CAM), using a genetically-engineered mouse (KM mouse) that contains the human immunoglobulin genes. Spleen cells from KM mice, immunized with recombinant MK-1, were fused with P3-U1 mouse myeloma cells. Of 44 anti-MK-1 clones analyzed, two were of IgG4 and the others of IgM clones. Although the two IgG4 clones were suggested to recognize the same antigenic determinant or two closely located determinants, their VK regions were encoded by different light-chain genes while their VH sequences were identical. The two IgG4 and one of the IgM clones tested revealed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, respectively, against MK-1-expressing cells in vitro, suggesting that these fully human mAbs produced against MK-1 and their V-region genes, which are applicable for the preparation of engineered antibody fragments that may be useful for antibody-based therapy of cancer.",M1
16291412,"Comparison of the effects of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% and olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solutions in seasonal allergic conjunctivities: a 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Topical antiallergic agents, such as antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers, are the main therapeutic options for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). Ketotifen fumarate and olopatadine HCl have dual action that offers a combination of these 2 mechanisms. Although clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these 2 drugs have shown that both were effective in the treatment of SAC, the results were contradictory and did not include the effects of these drugs on inflammatory markers. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare the clinical efficacy of topical ketotifen and olopatadine eye drops and to determine the effects of these 2 drugs on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells in patients with SAC. METHODS: This 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute (ATS)-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Karadeniz Technical University, School of Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey. Patients with SAC were included in the study and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: topical ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution, topical olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solution, or ATS (control group). All drugs were administered 2 drops per eye BID for 30 days. At the beginning of the study (day 0; baseline), on day 15, and on day 30, clinical scores (itching, tearing, redness, eyelid, swelling, and chemosis) and conjunctival impression cytology specimens were obtained. The percentages of cells expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular CAM-1, human leukocyte antigen-DR, and beta1-integrin (CD29) from conjunctival impression cytology specimens were determined using flow cytometry. Patients were questioned about adverse events (AEs) at each visit. Ocular discomfort on installation of the drugs was recorded as an AE. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (20 men, 19 women; age range, 18-61 years) with SAC were included. Twelve patients received ketotifen; 13, olopatadine; and 14, ATS. In both active-treatment groups, the improvements of clinical scores (tearing and itching) were more pronounced compared with those in the ATS group, although the day-30 difference in tearing score between the olopatadine and ATS groups was not statistically significant. No significant within-group or between-group differences in mean scores for redness, chemosis, or eyelid swelling were found. The expression rates of CAMs and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells were significantly more reduced with ketotifen and olopatadine compared with ATS. However, clinical and flow cytometric parameters were improved with ATS at 15 and 30 days compared with baseline. No AEs were observed during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study in a selected, small study population with SAC, ketotifen and olopatadine diminished the expression of CAMs and inflammatory markers on the conjunctival surface cells effectively. Both active treatments were more efficacious compared with ATS and were well tolerated.",M1
16249517,"Anti-inflammatory effect of docosahexaenoic acid on cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in human retinal vascular endothelial cells.PURPOSE: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA(22:6n3)), the principal n3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in the retina, has been shown to have a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies. Despite the importance of vascular inflammation in diabetic retinopathy, the anti-inflammatory role of DHA(22:6n3) in cytokine-stimulated human retinal vascular endothelial cells (hRVECs) has not been addressed. METHODS: Cytokine-induced expression of cell adhesion molecules (<e>CAMs</e>) was assessed by Western blot. The effect of DHA(22:6n3) on cytokine-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling was analyzed by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: Stimulation of hRVECs with VEGF(165), TNFalpha, or IL-1beta for 6 to 24 hours caused significant induction of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression. Pretreatment of the cells with 100 microM of BSA-bound DHA(22:6n3) for 24 hours remarkably inhibited cytokine-induced CAM expression. IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and VEGF(165) induced nuclear translocation and binding of p65 and p50 NF-kappaB isoforms to the VCAM-1 promoter. DHA(22:6n3) pretreatment inhibited cytokine-induced NF-kappaB binding by 25% to 40%. Moreover, DHA(22:6n3) diminished IL-1beta induced phosphorylation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (I-kappaBalpha), thus preventing its degradation. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and VEGF(165) induced CAM expression in hRVECs through activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. DHA(22:6n3) inhibited cytokine induced CAM expression through suppression of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and upstream I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation. DHA(22:6n3) could be an important anti-inflammatory agent in the face of increased cytokine production and CAM expression in the diabetic retina.",M1
16227163,"Expression of epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>) in small cell lung cancer as defined by monoclonal antibodies 17-1A and BerEP4.Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 15-20% of all lung cancer. Despite high initial response to chemotherapy chemoresistance at relapse leads to a less than 5% five-year survival rate. Adjuvant treatment with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against SCLC antigens may offer a therapeutic option. Mab 17-1A directed against the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) has been extensively tested for therapy in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Expression of Ep-CAM in SCLC has been earlier described. However, reactivity of Mab 17-1A and another Ep-CAM-binding Mab BerEP4 has not yet been described for SCLC. Using immunohistology first with BerEP4 and confirmatory with 17-1A a homogenous and strong expression of Ep-CAM was seen in all SCLC specimens tested (n = 10). For comparison, heterogenous expression was seen in the non-SCLC tumors tested (n = 15). These findings strongly suggest that Mab 17-1A can be useful for adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with SCLC. For detection of Ep-CAM in tumor tissue in patients that might be considered for immunotherapy with Mab 17-1A, Mab BerEP4 appears to be preferred.",M1
16214039,"Exogenous superoxide mediates pro-oxidative, proinflammatory, and procoagulatory changes in primary endothelial cell cultures.Endothelial dysfunction/activation underlies the development of long-term cardiovascular complications and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to examine a direct role for exogenous sublethal flux of superoxide on endothelial cell dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to superoxide generated by 0.1 mM xanthine and 4 mU/ml xanthine oxidase for 15 min and essential endothelial functions were examined. Superoxide dismutase and/or catalase was used as scavenger for O(2)(-)/H(2)O(2) to determine the key culprit. HUVEC detachment was determined by neutral red uptake and apoptosis by annexin V binding. Inflammation was estimated by IL-8 mRNA expression and cellular adhesion molecules (<e>CAM</e>). eNOS and iNOS message and eNOS protein served as an indirect measure for NO. Procoagulable state was evaluated by estimating the intracellular tissue factor. Activation of endothelial NADPH oxidase was determined by lucigenin chemiluminescence. Sublethal superoxide dose evoked: (1) proinflammatory state manifested by increased IL-8 mRNA expression and CAM on the endothelial surface, (2) HUVEC apoptosis and activated endothelial NADPH oxidase, (3) increase in intracellular tissue factor, and (4) decrease in eNOS mRNA and protein and up-regulation of iNOS mRNA. We conclude that extracellular low flux of superoxide exhibits pleiotropic characteristics, triggering activation/dysfunction of endothelial cells.",M1

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred fourteen serous effusions from 71 patients with tumors and 43 patients with benign diseases were subjected to RT-PCR for expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-<e>CAM</e>), E-cadherin, mammaglobin, mucin 1 (MUC1) isoforms MUC1/REP, MUC1/Y, and MUC1/Z, calretinin, and Wilms' tumor 1 susceptibility gene. RESULTS: CEA, Ep-CAM, E-cadherin, and mammaglobin were specifically expressed in malignant effusions. The sensitivity of RT-PCR in cytologically negative malignant effusions was 63.1% combining CEA and Ep-CAM (with 100% specificity) and reached 78.9% adding MUC1/Y or MUC1/Z (with 93% specificity). In the whole population of effusions, the combination of cytology with RT-PCR of CEA and Ep-CAM yielded a 90.1% sensitivity, a specificity and a positive predictive value of 100%, and a 86% negative predictive value for malignancy. Adding MUC1/Y or MUC1/Z to the panel, the sensitivity was 94.5% with 93% specificity, 95.7% PPV, and 90.9% negative predictive value. Moreover, CEA and mammaglobin were specifically expressed in epithelial malignancies, and mammaglobin was mainly expressed in effusions from breast carcinoma (97.3% of specificity). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of cytology and RT-PCR analysis of CEA and Ep-CAM significantly improved the detection sensitivity of tumor cells in serous effusions. RT-PCR analysis of CEA, Ep-CAM, and mammaglobin in serous effusions could be a beneficial adjunct to cytology for the diagnosis of malignancy.",M1
16187083,"Potent inhibition of local and disseminated tumor growth in immunocompetent mouse models by a bispecific antibody construct specific for Murine CD3.Bispecific single-chain antibody constructs specific for human CD3 have been extensively studied for antitumor activity in human xenograft models using severe combined immunodeficient mice supplemented with human T cells. High efficacy at low effector-to-target ratios, independence of T cell costimuli and a potent activation of previously unstimulated polyclonal T cells were identified as hallmarks of this class of bispecific antibodies. Here we studied a bispecific single-chain antibody construct (referred to as 'bispecific T cell engager', BiTE) in an immunocompetent mouse model. This was possible by the use of a murine CD3-specific BiTE, and a syngeneic melanoma cell line (B16F10) expressing the human Ep-<e>CAM</e> target. The murine CD3-specific BiTE, called 2C11x4-7 prevented in a dose-dependent fashion the outgrowth of subcutaneously growing B16/Ep-CAM tumors with daily i.v. injections of 5 or 50 microg BiTE which was most effective. Treatment with 2C11x4-7 was effective even when it was started 10 days after tumor cell inoculation but delayed treatments showed a reduction in the number of cured animals. 2C11x4-7 was also highly active in a lung tumor colony model. When treatment was started on the day of intravenous tumor cell injection, seven out of eight animals stayed free of lung tumors, and three out of eight animals when treatment was started on day 5. Our study shows that BiTEs also have a high antitumor activity in immunocompetent mice and that there is no obvious need for costimulation of T cells by secondary agents.",M1

For the routine testing of a broad variety of chemicals and formulations, we have used the Hen's Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) method. In the course of a tiered-testing strategy, and due to the lack of global regulatory acceptance of the HET-CAM method, we have also performed the Rabbit Eye Irritation test according to OECD Test Guideline 405. Of the 145 substances tested, 76% were classified as non-irritant/mild irritant and 13% were identified as irritant in vivo, according to the EU classification system (61% and 28%, respectively, with the GHS classification). The remaining 11% were severe irritants in vivo, based on the irreversibility of the effects and not due to sufficiently high irritation scores in the three days following application. The retrospective analysis revealed that the overall accuracy of the HET-CAM assay was 65% and the overall rates of false-negatives (FN) and false-positives (FP) were 50% and 33%, respectively. The HET-CAM assay was sufficiently specific (few FP) for water-soluble substances, but failed to identify nearly all the severe irritants within this group. In contrast, it was highly sensitive (no FN) for non-soluble and oil-soluble substances, but the specificity for this group was rather low. Therefore, we conclude that the HET-CAM assay is not useful in our tiered-testing strategy for eye irritation testing. However, for water-insoluble substances, it might be applicable in combination with another in vitro method, provided that regulatory acceptance is gained.",M2
20329705,"Wound healing activity of methanolic extract of leaves of Alternanthera brasiliana Kuntz using in vivo and in vitro model.Wound healing activity of methanolic extract of leaves of Alternanthera brasiliana Kuntz was studied by excision and incision wound model (in vivo) in Sprague Dawley rats and by Chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model (In vitro) in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. In excision wound model, compared to the control group, per cent contraction of wound was significantly higher in A. brasiliana (5% w/w ointment) treated group. In incision wound model, tensile strength of the healing tissue after treatment with A. brasiliana was found to be significantly higher compared to the control group indicating better wound healing activity of the test plant. These findings were also confirmed by histopathological examination. The extract also promoted angiogenesis as evidenced by CAM model. The results suggested that methanolic extract of A. brasiliana possess significant wound healing potential in normal wound.",M2
20187783,"Tetraiodothyroacetic acid and tetraiodothyroacetic acid nanoparticle effectively inhibit the growth of human follicular thyroid cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is a deaminated analogue of L-thyroxine that blocks the actions of L-thyroxine and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine at the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone on integrin alpha v beta 3. Tetrac blocks the proliferative effects of thyroid hormone on tumor cells and the proangiogenesis actions of the hormone. In the absence of thyroid hormone, tetrac also blocks angiogenesis induced by various growth factors. Covalently linked to poly(lactide-co-glycolide), tetrac nanoparticles (tetrac NP) do not gain access to the cell interior and act exclusively at the integrin receptor. Here, the activity of tetrac and tetrac NP against follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC)-236 cells was studied in two models: (1) tumor cell implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) system and (2) xenografts in the nude mouse. METHODS: FTC-236 cells (10(6)) were implanted in the CAM (n = 8 each for control, and for tetrac and tetrac NP, both at 1 microg/CAM) and the actions of tetrac and tetrac NP were determined after 8 days on tumor-related angiogenesis and tumor growth. Xenografts of 10(7) FTC-236 cells were implanted in nude mice (n = 8 per group). Tetrac or tetrac NP was administered intraperitoneal (1 mg/kg and 1 mg tetrac equivalent/kg, respectively) every other day for 32 days beginning on day 10, when tumor volume was 200-250 mm(3). Animals were monitored after discontinuation of treatment up to day 40. RESULTS: In the CAM paradigm, tetrac and tetrac NP arrested tumor-related angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the xenograft model, tetrac and tetrac NP promptly and progressively reduced tumor volume (p &lt; 0.01) over 32 days. There was some regrowth of tumor after interruption of tetrac treatment, but at day 40, tumor volume and tumor weight at sacrifice were 45-55% below those of controls (p &lt; 0.01). Animal weight gain was comparable in the control and treatment groups of animals. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrac and tetrac NP effectively arrest FTC-236 cell tumor growth in the CAM and xenograft models, suggesting its potential utility against FTC.",M2
20150615,"Potent pleiotropic anti-angiogenic effects of TM601, a synthetic chlorotoxin peptide.Chemically synthesized chlorotoxin (TM601) has been studied as a tumor targeting peptide. In this study, the anti-angiogenic properties of TM601 are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro and in vivo models of angiogenesis and tumor growth were used to characterize the anti-angiogenic effects of TM601. RESULTS: TM601 bound to proliferating vascular endothelial cells, decreased human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) invasion, and reduced secretion of bioactive matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (<e>CAM</e>), TM601 inhibited angiogenesis stimulated by any of eight pro-angiogenic factors, and when TM601 was co-administered with bevacizumab, the combination was significantly more potent than a ten-fold increase in bevacizumab dose. TM601 did not alter tumor or vascular endothelial cell growth in vitro, but TM601 treatment of tumors grown on the CAM decreased tumor growth and intra-tumoral hemoglobin levels. Intravenously injected TM601 was also shown to significantly decrease new blood vessel growth in mice. CONCLUSION: TM601 inhibits angiogenesis stimulated by many factors and potentiates the anti-angiogenic effect of bevacizumab.",M2
20147014,"Screening for transgenic Japanese quail offspring.After mosaic founder breeding pairs of Japanese quail start to produce fertile eggs, the hatchlings must be screened for germ-line transmission to the subsequent G1 generation. This article describes how to isolate hatchling genomic DNA from the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>), which remains inside the egg after hatching. Collecting genomic DNA from the CAM decreases the hatchling's stress during handling and eliminates the need for a blood draw. By following this protocol, the CAM of a single egg will provide 50 microg or more of high-quality genomic DNA. The article also describes how to screen the genomic DNA samples for the transgene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR genotyping should be used for screening hatchlings with a nonfluorescent transgene or with a fluorescently labeled transgene that does not lend itself well to phenotypic screening.",M2
20133461,"Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and nanoparticulate tetrac arrest growth of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.CONTEXT: Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) blocks angiogenic and tumor cell proliferation actions of thyroid hormone initiated at the cell surface hormone receptor on integrin alphavbeta3. Tetrac also inhibits angiogenesis initiated by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. OBJECTIVE: We tested antiangiogenic and antiproliferative efficacy of tetrac and tetrac nanoparticles (tetrac NP) against human medullary thyroid carcinoma (h-MTC) implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) and h-MTC xenografts in the nude mouse. DESIGN: h-MTC cells were implanted in the CAM model (n = 8 per group); effects of tetrac and tetrac NP at 1 microg/CAM were determined on tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth after 8 d. h-MTC cells were also implanted sc in nude mice (n = 6 animals per group), and actions on established tumor growth of unmodified tetrac and tetrac NP ip were determined. RESULTS: In the CAM, tetrac and tetrac NP inhibited tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis. In the nude mouse xenograft model, established 450-500 mm(3) h-MTC tumors were reduced in size over 21 d by both tetrac formulations to less than the initial cell mass (100 mm(3)). Tumor tissue hemoglobin content of xenografts decreased by 66% over the course of administration of each drug. RNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR of tumor cell mRNAs revealed that both tetrac formulations significantly induced antiangiogenic thrombospondin 1 and apoptosis activator gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Acting via a cell surface receptor, tetrac and tetrac NP inhibit growth of h-MTC cells and associated angiogenesis in CAM and mouse xenograft models.",M2
20096797,"Validating and troubleshooting ocular in vitro toxicology tests.In vitro organotypic models for testing ocular irritants have warranted sufficient interest as methods to replace in vivo ocular testing. The in vitro organotypic models claim to maintain short-term normal physiological and biochemical functions of the mammalian cornea in an isolated system. In these test methods, damage by the test substance is assessed by quantitative measurements of changes in corneal opacity and permeability using opacitometry and spectrophotometry, respectively. Both measurements are used quantitatively for irritancy classification for prediction of the in vivo ocular irritation potential of a test substance. Examples of organotypic models that incorporate these criteria include: the bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) assay, the isolated chicken eye (ICE) test method and the isolated rabbit eye (IRE) assay. A fourth method, the hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-<e>CAM</e>) assay, differs in the evaluation criteria but is also normally included among this class of in vitro protocols. Each of these protocols is discussed in detail as representative candidate in vitro methods for assessing ocular irritation and corrosion. The methodologies, protocol details, applications, and their validation status are discussed. A brief historical perspective of the development of original in vitro ocular testing models is also mentioned. More importantly, improving and troubleshooting the current techniques, in order to present the models as stand-alone in vitro tools for ocular toxicity assessment, is emphasized.",M2
20096070,"Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy with cisplatin: can it suppress angiogenesis in H22 hepatocarcinoma cells?Low-dose chemotherapy drugs can suppress tumours by restraining tumour vessel growth and preventing the repair of damaged vascular endothelial cells. Cisplatin is a broad-spectrum, cell cycle-non-specific drug, but has serious side effects if used at high doses. There have been few reports on the anti-angiogenic effects of low-dose cisplatin and hence the effect of low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy on the proliferation and neovascularization of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells is discussed in this research. The influence of LDM chemotherapy with cisplatin on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and proliferation of the HepG(2) human hepatocarcinoma cell line were measured using MTT assays. The LDM group was treated with cisplatin 0.6 mg/kg/day; the control group with saline 0.2 ml; the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) group with cisplatin 9 mg/kg/day. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) were detected using immunohistochemical staining. A chicken chorio-allantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model was used to check the inhibitory effect of LDM chemotherapy with cisplatin on neovascularization in vivo. Low-dose cisplatin inhibited HUVEC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but was ineffective in inhibiting HepG(2) cell proliferation. Tumour growth was delayed in mice receiving LDM cisplatin, without apparent body weight loss, compared with mice that received MTD cisplatin. Microvessel density and expression of VEGF and MMP-2 were much lower in mice receiving LDM cisplatin than in the control and MTD groups. Continuous low-dose cisplatin suppressed CAM angiogenesis in vivo. LDM chemotherapy with cisplatin can inhibit the growth of blood vessel endothelial cells in vitro and shows anti-angiogenic ability in vivo.",M2
20066899,"The inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1) proteins suppress angiogenesis and differentially regulate angiopoietin expression in glioblastoma cells.The inhibitor of growth 1 (ING1) homologue ING4 has previously been implicated as a negative regulator of angiogenesis in a murine glioma and a multiple myeloma model. An association between ING1 and angiogenesis has not been reported yet. Our previous studies using tumor samples from patients have shown that ING1 levels are downregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most highly vascularized malignancies. Based on this background, the goal of this study was to test the effects of the major ING1 splicing isoforms, p47ING1a and p33ING1b, on pathological angiogenesis induced by human GBM cells. We used a chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay to examine whether LN229 human GBM cells can induce angiogenesis and whether alterations in ING1 expression, such as ING1 knockdown by siRNA or ectopic ING1 overexpression using ING1a and ING1b expression constructs, can affect this process. Increased ING1 protein expression significantly suppressed LN229 cell-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay. While no effects on the proangiogenic factors VEGF or IL-8 were noted, the expression of angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 4 were increased by the p47ING1a, but not by the p33ING1b isoform. Levels of Ang-2 were not sensitive to altered ING1 levels. Our data are the first to suggest that ING1 proteins suppress neoangiogenesis in GBM. Moreover, our results may support the idea that ING1 proteins regulate the expression of proteins that are critical for angiogenesis in GBM such as the angiopoietins.",M2
20049873,"Discovery of a benzoxazine derivative promoting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Angiogenesis is a multi-step process that refers to the growth of new vessels from pre-existing ones. Endothelial proliferation, migration, and tube formation constitute a critical step in angiogenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that a novel benzoxazine derivative, 6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (ABO) could improve the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and serum. In this study, we further tested its effect on endothelial angiogenesis with Matrigel assay, migration assay, and in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. Our results showed that ABO effectively facilitated cell migration and promoted capillary-like tube formation in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, nitric oxide (NO) level/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Our data indicated that ABO depressed ROS with inhibition of NADPH oxidase instead of SOD activity, stimulated NO production and eNOS activation, and restored MMP in HUVECs. Our findings suggest that ABO is a promising tool for exploring the mechanisms of angiogenesis and may have a therapeutic potential in ischemic pathologies.",M2
20039788,"Comparative study of the ocular irritation potential of various alkyl polyglucoside surfactants.In the present work, we assessed the relationship between alkyl carbon chain length and ocular irritation potentials using the hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-<e>CAM</e>) and bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) assays using 5 commercial alkyl polyglucoside surfactants with different compositions of alkyl chain lengths (C(6)-C(16)). With HET-CAM, there was a good correlation between the proportion of C(10) alkyl polyglucoside and the eye irritation potential Q score (r(2) = 0.912, p = .011). There were no significant differences between the proportion of C(10) alkyl polyglucoside and corneal opacity in BCOP assays; however, there was a relatively high positive correlation between the proportion of C(10) alkyl carbon chain lengths and corneal permeability (r(2) = 0.736, p = .063).",M2
19949373,"Chick ex ovo culture and ex ovo <e>CAM</e> assay: how it really works.Chicken eggs in the early phase of breeding are between in vitro and in vivo systems and provide a vascular test environment not only to study angiogenesis but also to study tumorigenesis. After the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has developed, its blood vessel network can be easily accessed, manipulated and observed and therefore provides an optimal setting for angiogenesis assays. Since the lymphoid system is not fully developed until late stages of incubation, the chick embryo serves as a naturally immunodeficient host capable of sustaining grafted tissues and cells without species-specific restrictions. In addition to nurturing developing allo- and xenografts, the CAM blood vessel network provides a uniquely supportive environment for tumor cell intravasation, dissemination, and vascular arrest and a repository where arrested cells extravasate to form micro metastatic foci. For experimental purposes, in most of the recent studies the CAM was exposed by cutting a window through the egg shell and experiments were carried out in ovo, resulting in significant limitations in the accessibility of the CAM and possibilities for observation and photo documentation of effects. When shell-less cultures of the chick embryo were used(1-4), no experimental details were provided and, if published at all, the survival rates of these cultures were low. We refined the method of ex ovo culture of chick embryos significantly by introducing a rationally controlled extrusion of the egg content. These ex ovo cultures enhance the accessibility of the CAM and chick embryo, enabling easy in vivo documentation of effects and facilitating experimental manipulation of the embryo. This allows the successful application to a large number of scientific questions: (1) As an improved angiogenesis assay(5,6), (2) an experimental set up for facilitated injections in the vitreous of the chick embryo eye(7-9), (3) as a test environment for dissemination and intravasation of dispersed tumor cells from established cell lines inoculated on the CAM(10-12), (4) as an improved sustaining system for successful transplantation and culture of limb buds of chicken and mice(13) as well as (5) for grafting, propagation, and re-grafting of solid primary tumor tissue obtained from biopsies on the surface of the CAM(14). In this video article we describe the establishment of a refined chick ex ovo culture and CAM assay with survival rates over 50%. Besides we provide a step by step demonstration of the successful application of the ex ovo culture for a large number of scientific applications.",M2
19924294,"Correlating global gene regulation to angiogenesis in the developing chick extra-embryonic vascular system.BACKGROUND: Formation of blood vessels requires the concerted regulation of an unknown number of genes in a spatial-, time- and dosage-dependent manner. Determining genes, which drive vascular maturation is crucial for the identification of new therapeutic targets against pathological angiogenesis. METHOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We accessed global gene regulation throughout maturation of the chick chorio-allantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>), a highly vascularized tissue, using pan genomic microarrays. Seven percent of analyzed genes showed a significant change in expression (&gt;2-fold, FDR&lt;5%) with a peak occurring from E7 to E10, when key morphogenetic and angiogenic genes such as BMP4, SMO, HOXA3, EPAS1 and FGFR2 were upregulated, reflecting the state of an activated endothelium. At later stages, a general decrease in gene expression occurs, including genes encoding mitotic factors or angiogenic mediators such as CYR61, EPAS1, MDK and MYC. We identified putative human orthologs for 77% of significantly regulated genes and determined endothelial cell enrichment for 20% of the orthologs in silico. Vascular expression of several genes including ENC1, FSTL1, JAM2, LDB2, LIMS1, PARVB, PDE3A, PRCP, PTRF and ST6GAL1 was demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Up to 9% of the CAM genes were also overexpressed in human organs with related functions, such as placenta and lung or the thyroid. 21-66% of CAM genes enriched in endothelial cells were deregulated in several human cancer types (P&lt;.0001). Interfering with PARVB (encoding parvin, beta) function profoundly changed human endothelial cell shape, motility and tubulogenesis, suggesting an important role of this gene in the angiogenic process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study underlines the complexity of gene regulation in a highly vascularized organ during development. We identified a restricted number of novel genes enriched in the endothelium of different species and tissues, which may play crucial roles in normal and pathological angiogenesis.",M2
19885398,"The effect of ultrasound on angiogenesis: an in vivo study using the chick chorioallantoic membrane.PURPOSE: Ultrasound therapy induces clinical healing of irradiated avascular mandibular bone and fractures. In vitro ultrasound in tissue culture has been shown to stimulate bone formation synthesis and bone remodeling factors and to stimulate osteoblast proliferation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of short-wave (1-MHz) and long-wave (45-kHz) ultrasound on the vascularity of the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of a fertilized egg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nature of the angiogenic effect was investigated using the CAM of a fertilized egg by: (1) application of sonicated fibroblast media incorporated into methylcellulose disks onto the CAM and (2) direct application of the ultrasound, using both long-wave (45-kHz) and short-wave (1-MHz) frequencies at a range of intensities, to the surface of the egg. Angiogenesis was assessed quantitatively by three independent observers. RESULTS: Both ultrasound methods showed evidence of an angiogenic effect compared to controls. The most effective results were seen with direct application of a 45-kHz wave at an intensity of 15 mW/cm(2) and indirect application of the media of fibroblasts ultrasonicated at 1 MHz with an intensity of 0.4 W/cm(2). CONCLUSION: This model confirms that ultrasound can induce neoangiogenesis in vivo.",M2
19874890,"Effect of hydroxyl substitution of flavone on angiogenesis and free radical scavenging activities: a structure-activity relationship studies using computational tools.Angiogenesis is a key process needed for the growth and survival of solid tumors. Anti-angiogenesis may arrest the tumor growth and keep check on cancer metastasis. Developing antiangiogenic agents have remained a significant hope in the mainstream of anticancer research. The free radical implications in the initiation of cancers are well established. In the present studies, simple flavone and flavones with hydroxyl substitution in 'A' and 'C' ring at 3, 5, 6, and 7 were studied for antiangiogenic activities using chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model and kinetics of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazine) and superoxide anion radical (SOR) scavenging activities. The docking of selected flavones with specific angiogenic targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) from human origin was carried out to focus the possible underlying mechanism of anti-angiogenesis. The result of the present studies shows that the 3-hydroxy substitution of the flavone was found to be the most promising lead for antiangiogenic activity in CAM model. The same was true for DPPH reduction with greater velocity as compared to other hydroxyl substitutions. However the 7- and 6-hydroxy substitution were observed to be more favourable for SOR scavenging activities as compared to other hydroxyl substitutions. The docking experiments shows that the VEGFR2 seems to be a structurally compatible target for tight binding of the flavones especially with 3-hydroxy substitution (-9.78 kcal/mole) as compared to VEGF (-8.47 kcal/mole) and HIF-1alpha (-8.99 kcal/mole). The quantum chemical descriptors of the test flavones related to free radical scavenging and other biological activities were calculated using computational tools. The data is discussed in the light of structure-activity relationship.",M2
19857502,"Processing of fluorescence angiograms for the quantification of vascular effects induced by anti-angiogenic agents in the <e>CAM</e> model.The chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is widely used as an in vivo model to study the vascular effects of angiogenesis modulating agents. The main goal of the present study was to develop and validate a quantitative method to characterize time-dependent changes mainly in the capillary network of the CAM. To that end, the CAM capillaries were monitored in ovo, between days 7 and 13 of embryo development, using an epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with a sensitive camera following the intravenous injection of a fluorescent agent. We present a method by which the fluorescence angiograms of the CAM vasculature were recorded and analyzed by a multistep mathematical procedure to obtain a skeleton representation of the vessels and capillaries. From this skeleton descriptors were extracted, including the number of branching points/mm(2), the mean area of the vessel network meshes, and the mean of the 3rd quartile of the mesh area histogram. A qualitative visual assessment of the vasculature based on the number and the size of the avascular zones was obtained for comparison. To illustrate this approach, the activity of a neutralizing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, Avastin (Bevacizumab), was then quantified. Blood vessel growth inhibition and changes in the architecture of the capillary plexus after topical application of this drug on the CAM surface were monitored using the three descriptors mentioned above.",M2
19846915,"Tetraidothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and tetrac nanoparticles inhibit growth of human renal cell carcinoma xenografts.Renal cell carcinoma is the most lethal of the common urologic malignancies, with no available effective therapeutics. Tetrac (tetraiodothyroacetic acid) is a deaminated analogue of L-thyroxine (T(4)) that blocks the pro-angiogenesis actions of T(4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodo-L-thyronine as well as other growth factors at the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone on integrin alphavbeta3. Since this integrin is expressed on cancer cells and also on endothelial and vascular smooth cells, the possibility exists that Tetrac may act on both cell types to block the proliferative effects of thyroid hormone on tumor growth and tumor-related angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of Tetrac on tumor cell proliferation and on related angiogenesis of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We used two models: tumor cell implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) system and xenografts in nude mice. To determine the relative contribution of the nuclear versus the plasma membrane action of Tetrac, we compared the effects of unmodified Tetrac to Tetrac covalently linked to poly (lactide-co-glycolide) as a nanoparticle (Tetrac NP) that acts exclusively at the cell surface through the integrin receptor. In the CAM model, Tetrac and Tetrac NP (both at 1 microg/CAM) arrested tumor-related angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the mouse xenograft model, Tetrac and Tetrac NP promptly reduced tumor volume (p&lt;0.01) when administered daily for up to 20 days. Animal weight gain was comparable in the control and treatment groups. Overall, the findings presented here provide evidence for the anti-angiogenic, and anti-tumor actions of Tetrac and Tetrac NP and suggest their potential utility in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.",M2
19842048,"Evaluation of metastatic and angiogenic potentials of human colon carcinoma cells in chick embryo model systems.Increased metastatic and angiogenic potentials of aggressive human colon carcinoma cells were verified in independent chick embryo models by comparing in vivo highly metastatic SW620 colon carcinoma cell line with its isogenic, non-metastatic SW480 cell variant. In the experimental metastasis model, both cell types rapidly arrested in the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) vasculature as demonstrated by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Live cell imaging also indicated that both SW620 and SW480 cells efficiently extravasated from the CAM capillary system. However, only few SW480 cells were present in the CAM tissue after 24-48 h. In contrast, the numbers of SW620 cells increased exponentially, indicating proliferative and survival advantages of metastatic colon carcinoma cells in vivo. Multicellular SW620 foci were identified in close proximity to CAM blood vessels. A positive correlation between increased metastatic ability and VEGF-expression of colon carcinoma SW620 cells was demonstrated by the substantial inhibitory effects of anti-VEGF treatment on the levels of metastatic colonization and density of blood vessels adjacent to tumor cell foci. Furthermore, the chick embryo angiogenesis model confirmed high levels of VEGF-dependent angiogenesis induced by SW620 cells, but not SW480 cells. Thus, chick embryo experimental metastasis and CAM angiogenesis models appear to coordinately reflect critical features of advanced colon carcinomas, i.e., the acquisition of enhanced survival and increased angiogenic potentials, both constituting critical determinants of colon cancer progression. The use of rapid and quantitative chick embryo models might provide alternative approaches to conventional mammalian model systems for screening anti-cancer agents.",M2
19841617,"Acyclic retinoid inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing the MAPK pathway.Acyclic retinoid (ACR) is currently under clinical trial as an agent to suppress the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through its ability to induce apoptosis in premature HCC cells. ACR has an anticancer effect in vivo as well, although it shows weak apoptosis-inducing activity against mature HCC cells, suggesting the existence of an additional action mechanism. In this study, we investigated the antiangiogenic activity of ACR. ACR inhibited angiogenesis within chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) in as similar a manner as all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). Although suppression of angiogenesis by atRA was partially rescued by the simultaneous addition of angiopoietin-1, suppression of angiogenesis by ACR was not rescued under the same condition at all. Conversely, although suppression of angiogenesis by ACR was partially inverted by the simultaneous addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suppression of angiogenesis by atRA was not affected under the same condition. These results suggested that mechanisms underlying the suppression of angiogenesis by ACR and atRA were different. ACR selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) without changing their protein expression levels, and inhibited endothelial cell growth, migration, and tube formation. The inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK, endothelial growth, migration, tube formation, and angiogenesis by ACR was rescued by the overexpression of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Finally, ACR, but not atRA, inhibited HCC-induced angiogenesis in a xenografted CAM model. These results delineate the novel activity of ACR as an antiangiogenic through a strong inhibition of the VEGFR2 MAPK pathway.",M2
19834094,"Development-promoting effect of chicken embryo membrane on chicken ovarian cortical pieces of different age.Ovarian cortical tissues of various ages of chicken were grafted underneath chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of 6-d-old chicken embryo and the grafts were collected on d 0, 2, 4, 8, or 10. The tissue sections were prepared to examine the development of follicles in grafts and the proliferative ability of follicles was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The results indicated that the development of follicles in cultured chicken ovarian cortical pieces progressed smoothly and slowly similar to those in vivo, and the environment of chicken embryo was more suitable for the synchronous development of oocyte and follicular cells in the larger follicles. Meanwhile, the synchronous development could be more easily achieved in the chicken ovarian tissues of 12- to 15-wk chicken. Neither oocyte nor granulosa cells but the thecal cells of follicles developed in grafts of 13- to 15-d chicken within 10 d of culturing in ovo, and the CAM can ease follicular atresia in chicken ovarian grafts of 12- to 15-wk chicken. The proliferative performance of follicles in the grafts was not influenced by the environment of chicken embryo. These results indicated that the chicken embryo has the ability to support slow development of primordial and primary follicles in grafted ovarian cortical tissues of chickens of different ages. The CAM system may also prove useful for the study of early follicle development with further information.",M2
19800684,"Scaffolds with covalently immobilized VEGF and Angiopoietin-1 for vascularization of engineered tissues.The aim of this study was to engineer a biomaterial capable of supporting vascularization in vitro and in vivo. We covalently immobilized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) onto three-dimensional porous collagen scaffolds using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) chemistry. Over both 3 and 7 days in vitro, seeded endothelial cells (ECs) had increased proliferation on scaffolds with immobilized VEGF and/or Ang1 compared to unmodified scaffolds and soluble growth factor controls. Notably, the group with co-immobilized VEGF and Ang1 showed significantly higher cell number (P=0.0079), higher overall lactate production rate (P=0.0044) and higher overall glucose consumption rate (P=0.0034) at Day 3, compared to its corresponding soluble control for which growth factors were added to culture medium. By Day 7, hematoxylin and eosin, live/dead, CD31, and von Willebrand factor staining all showed improved tube formation by ECs when cultivated on scaffolds with co-immobilized growth factors. Interestingly, scaffolds with co-immobilized VEGF and Ang1 showed increased EC infiltration in the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay, compared to scaffolds with independently immobilized VEGF/Ang1. This study presents an alternative method for promoting the formation of vascular structures, via covalent immobilization of angiogenic growth factors that are more stable than soluble ones and have a localized effect.",M2
19774659,"Methyl trypsin loaded poly(D,L-lactide-coglycolide) nanoparticles for contact lens care.The need of an enzymatic cleaner for soft contact lens care with an improved ocular safety and stability profile led us to evaluate the use of nanoparticles (NPs) of poly(D,L-lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) and methyl trypsin (MT). NPs were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. A factorial design was performed to select the lactic acid proportion in the copolymer and conditions of the second sonication. The increment in proportion of lactic acid provided higher particle size results. When the time of second sonication was decreased, the entrapment efficiency (EE) increased. PLGA 50:50 NPs were chosen for further development since PLGA 50:50H NPs settled fast with different particle size in the sediment and PLGA 75:25 NPs led to form aggregates. The addition of glycerol to the NPs provided the highest EE of MT (&gt;90%) while the addition of Tetronic 1304 promoted the fast release of enzyme initially and decreased the zeta potential (zeta) up to neutral values after gamma irradiation. NPs are expected to be effective as a lens care cleaner after 3 days or even longer with a very low quantity of enzyme released. Formulations showed an acceptable irritation ocular tolerance after in vitro HET-<e>CAM</e> test and in vivo Draize test.",M2

Collectively, morin possesses antiangiogenic, in vivo anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive activities.",M2
19720068,"Evaluation of angiogenic activities of hyaluronan oligosaccharides of defined minimum size.AIMS: Oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (o-HAs) were proved to have pro-angiogenic activities. The aim of this study was to obtain four hyaluronan oligosaccharides (o-HAs) of defined molecular weight including 4 saccharide residues (o-HA4), 6 saccharide residues (o-HA6), 8 saccharide residues (o-HA8), and 10 saccharide residues (o-HA10) under optimum conditions, and compare their angiogenic activities. MAIN METHODS: The four o-HAs were prepared by digesting the native high molecular weight HA with hyaluronidase under optimum conditions. The effects of the four o-HAs on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation were measured using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenil tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Angiogenic effects of the four o-HAs were evaluated using chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. The effects of the four o-HAs on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions were detected by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). KEY FINDINGS: O-HA6, o-HA8 and o-HA10 could effectively promote the proliferation of HUVEC, induce angiogenesis in the CAM assay and increase VEGF mRNA levels in HUVEC. No significant effects were found with o-HA4. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggested that o-HA6, o-HA8, and o-HA10, but not o-HA4 were effective angiogenic factors.",M2
19715750,"Anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-nociceptive activities of an ethanol extract of Salvia plebeia R. Brown.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salvia plebeia R. Brown has been used for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases, cold and tumors in many countries, including Korea and China. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to assess anti-inflammatory and related activities of an ethanol extract (SPEE) prepared from the dried whole parts of Salvia plebeia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-angiogenic and anti-nociceptive activities of SPEE were analyzed using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay and acetic acid-induced writhing response, respectively. Anti-inflammatory activity of SPEE was evaluated using acetic acid-induced vascular permeability, carrageenan-induced inflammation in the air pouch and analyses of nitrite content and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level in the macrophage cells. RESULTS: SPEE gave rise to a significant inhibition in chick chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis. SPEE exhibited anti-inflammatory activities in vascular permeability and air-pouch models. In the air-pouch model, SPEE was able to diminish exudate volume, number of polymorphonulcear leukocytes and nitrite content. SPEE also displayed anti-nociceptive activity in the writhing response model in mice. SPEE significantly decreased nitrite content and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells, while it could not modulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels in the stimulated phages. SPEE decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the stimulated macrophages. CONCLUSION: The ethanol extract (SPEE) of Salvia plebeia possesses anti-inflammatory and related anti-angiogenic, anti-nociceptive and antioxidant activities, which offers partial support to its folkloric use.",M2
19706144,"Combination therapy using verteporfin and ranibizumab; optimizing the timing in the <e>CAM</e> model.Combining photodynamic therapy (PDT) using verteporfin (Visudyne) with ranibizumab (Lucentis) can optimize the overall treatment outcome by providing more efficacy in vessel closure, and thus reduce the need for retreatment in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration. In this preclinical study in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo, we compare the vascular occlusion effects of verteporfin and ranibizumab as monotherapies with those observed in the combined therapy. In order to optimize the combination therapy, we varied the timing and sequence of the PDT and antivascular endothelial growth factor modalities. We observed that 1 day after PDT, the smaller blood vessels (Ø &lt; 70 microm) of the CAM were selectively occluded, but as early as 2 days after PDT, both significant reperfusion and regrowth of new vessels were observed. Both these phenomena could be significantly delayed by application of ranibizumab. Ranibizumab itself did not induce any vascular occlusion. Under the applied conditions of combination therapy, the occlusion of the targeted blood vessels could be significantly extended to 3 days in this model compared with 1 day in the case of verteporfin monotherapy. Thus, in the present preclinical study, we demonstrate that for the applied conditions, the optimal time to administer ranibizumab is 24 h after PDT.",M2
19682397,"Vasohibin inhibits angiogenic sprouting in vitro and supports vascular maturation processes in vivo.BACKGROUND: The murine homologue of human vasohibin (mVASH1), a putative antiangiogenic protein, was investigated for its effects on in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis. METHODS: Cell growth and migration were analyzed in murine fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Angiogenic sprouting was studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the spheroid sprouting assay. In vivo effects on blood vessel formation were investigated in the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay and in the C57BL/6 melanoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Purified murine and human VASH1 protein induced apoptosis of murine fibroblasts in vitro, but not of vascular aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) or endothelial cells. Adenoviral overexpression of murine and human VASH1 inhibited capillary sprouting of HUVECs in the spheroid assay. Administration of recombinant murine and human VASH1 inhibited growth of large vessels in the CAM assay and promoted the formation of a dense, fine vascular network. Murine VASH1-overexpressing B16F10 melanomas displayed a reduction in large vessels and vascular area. Moreover, tumors showed more microvessels that stained positive for the mural cell markers alpha-smooth muscle cell actin (ASMA) and proteoglycan (NG2). CONCLUSION: Our data imply that murine VASH1 causes angiogenic remodelling by inhibiting angiogenic sprouting and large vessel growth, thereby supporting the formation of a vascular bed consisting predominantly of mature microvessels.",M2
19651122,"Pro-angiogenic properties of orosomucoid (ORM).The acute phase protein orosomucoid (ORM), also known as alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), is found to be increased in infection, inflammation and cancer. Recently, we demonstrated that ORM is produced by endothelial cells and detectable in urine samples of patients with bladder cancer. However, it was not clarified yet whether ORM plays a role in new vessel formation. To this aim we performed overexpression and gene silencing for ORM in human microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs). ORM purified from human plasma was used individually or in combination with VEGF-A in endothelial tube formation, migration and proliferation assay. The in vivo effect of ORM in angiogenesis was studied using the chicken chorionallantois membrane (<e>CAM</e>) with subsequent counting of blood vessels on histological sections from the stimulated areas of CAM tissue. Our data show that ORM alone enhances migration but not proliferation of HDMECs. ORM alone does not induce endothelial tubes in vitro but simultaneous application of ORM with VEGF-A increases the number and the network of VEGF-A-induced endothelial tubes. Remarkably, ORM alone induces new vessel formation in vivo using CAM assay and supports the VEGF-A-induced new vessel formation in this assay. Taken together, our results let assume that ORM has pro-angiogenic properties and supports the angiogenic effect of VEGF-A. Thus, ORM seems to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis.",M2
19635491,"A horsefly saliva antigen 5-like protein containing RTS motif is an angiogenesis inhibitor.The Ag5 proteins are the most abundant and immunogenic proteins in the venom secretory ducts of stinging insects. An antigen 5-like protein (named tabRTS) composed of 221 amino acid residues was purified and characterized from the salivary glands of the horsefly, Tabanus yao (Diptera, Tabanidae). Its cDNA was cloned from the cDNA library of the horsefly's salivary gland. TabRTS containing the SCP domain (Sc7 family of extracellular protein domain) was found in insect antigen 5 proteins. More interestingly, there is an Arg-Thr-Ser (RTS) disintegrin motif at the C-terminus of tabRTS. The RTS motif is positioned in a loop bracketed by cysteine residues as those found in RTS-disintegrins of Crotalidae and Viperidae snake venoms, which act as angiogenesis inhibitors. Endothelial Cell Tube formation assay in vitro and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) angiogenesis assay in vivo were performed as to investigate the effect of tabRTS on angiogenesis. It was found that tabRTS could significantly inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Anti-alpha(1)beta(1) monoclonal antibody could dose-dependently inhibit the anti-angiogenic activity of tabRTS. This result indicated that tabRTS possibly targets the alpha(1)beta(1) integrin to exert the anti-angiogenic activity as snake venom RTS-/KTS-disintegrins do. The current work revealed the first angiogenesis inhibitor protein containing RTS motif from invertebrates, a possible novel type of RTS-disintegrin.",M2
19619562,"Mathematical modelling of tissue-engineered angiogenesis.We present a mathematical model for the vascularisation of a porous scaffold following implantation in vivo. The model is given as a set of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which describe the evolution in time of the amounts of the different tissue constituents inside the scaffold. Bifurcation analyses reveal how the extent of scaffold vascularisation changes as a function of the parameter values. For example, it is shown how the loss of seeded cells arising from slow infiltration of vascular tissue can be overcome using a prevascularisation strategy consisting of seeding the scaffold with vascular cells. Using certain assumptions it is shown how the system can be simplified to one which is partially tractable and for which some analysis is given. Limited comparison is also given of the model solutions with experimental data from the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay.",M2
19469865,"Overexpression of  malignancy-associated laminins and  laminin receptors by angiotropic  human melanoma cells in a chick  chorioallantoic membrane model.BACKGROUND: As distinct from intravascular/lymphatic dissemination, extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM) has been described as a potential additional mechanism of melanoma spread in which tumor cells migrate along the external surfaces of vessels. Angiotropic melanoma cells are linked to the endothelium by a matrix containing laminin. In addition, it has been shown that C16 laminin-derived peptide increases extravascular migration of human green fluorescent protein (GFP) melanoma cells along vessels in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model (<e>CAM</e>). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that expression levels of some genes related to lamimin and metastasis are differentially expressed in vascularized angiotropic melanoma areas vs. avascular melanoma areas from the same tumor. DESIGN: C8161 human melanoma cells in a shell-less chick CAM assay were used to study EVMM associated with the presence of vascularized angiotropic melanoma areas. For both high-quality histomorphology and RNA preservation in paraffin-embedded tissue, we used a methanol-based fixative coupled with microwave-assisted rapid tissue processing as previously described. Using laser capture microdissection, angiotropic melanoma areas as well as avascular areas were microdissected. Using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), six genes have been studied: LAMC2 (laminin gamma2 chain), LAMA4 (laminin alpha4 chain), ITGB1 (integrin beta1), ITGB3 (integrin beta3), RSPA (ribosomal protein), and MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2). QRT-PCR data were normalized to human GAPDH housekeeping gene and values were compared against Human Total RNA. Final results were expressed as percentage of expression. RESULTS: All tumors demonstrated a similar pattern, i.e. EVMM of angiotropic melanoma cells. The microdissected histopathological sections presented both angiotropic areas and avascular areas. All genes were overexpressed in angiotropic melanoma areas vs. avascular melanoma areas, especially LAMC2, LAMA4 and ITGB3 (respectively, 165.18, 208.86, and 483.69%). CONCLUSION: This study shows that several genes related to laminin are overexpressed in angiotropic melanoma areas vs. avascular melanoma areas. Since extravascular migration of melanoma cells along vessels has been demonstrated in the CAM model, taken together these results suggests that some laminins and laminin receptors may play a role in extravascular migratory metastasis. This model may represent a promising strategy to analyze differential gene expression in EVMM.",M2
19428938,"Wogonoside inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo via toll-like receptor 4 signal transduction.Wogonoside, one flavonoid derived from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-inflammation activity; however, whether it can inhibit inflammation-induced angiogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of wogonoside on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Wogonoside suppressed the LPS-stimulated migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as well as microvessel sprouting from rat aortic rings in vitro. Moreover, wogonoside also inhibited LPS-stimulated vessel growth of Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) in vivo. The mechanism revealed that wogonoside inhibited LPS-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) up-regulation and its downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation, by decreasing the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The results suggest that wogonoside inhibits LPS-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both inflammation and angiogenesis progress.",M2

19424488,"Endocrine activity of extraembryonic membranes extends beyond placental amniotes.BACKGROUND: During development, all amniotes (mammals, reptiles, and birds) form extraembryonic membranes, which regulate gas and water exchange, remove metabolic wastes, provide shock absorption, and transfer maternally derived nutrients. In viviparous (live-bearing) amniotes, both extraembryonic membranes and maternal uterine tissues contribute to the placenta, an endocrine organ that synthesizes, transports, and metabolizes hormones essential for development. Historically, endocrine properties of the placenta have been viewed as an innovation of placental amniotes. However, an endocrine role of extraembryonic membranes has not been investigated in oviparous (egg-laying) amniotes despite similarities in their basic structure, function, and shared evolutionary ancestry. In this study, we ask whether the oviparous chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of chicken (Gallus gallus) has the capability to synthesize and receive signaling of progesterone, a major placental steroid hormone. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We quantified mRNA expression of key steroidogenic enzymes involved in progesterone synthesis and found that 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts pregnenolone to progesterone exhibited a 464 fold increase in the CAM from day 8 to day 18 of embryonic development (F(5, 68) = 89.282, p&lt;0.0001). To further investigate progesterone synthesis, we performed explant culture and found that the CAM synthesizes progesterone in vitro in the presence of a steroid precursor. Finally, we quantified mRNA expression and performed protein immunolocalization of the progesterone receptor in the CAM. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively, our data indicate that the chick CAM is steroidogenic and has the capability to both synthesize progesterone and receive progesterone signaling. These findings represent a paradigm shift in evolutionary reproductive biology by suggesting that endocrine activity of extraembryonic membranes is not a novel characteristic of placental amniotes. Rather, we hypothesize that these membranes may share an additional unifying characteristic, steroidogenesis, across amniotes at large.",M2
19423313,"Anti-angiogenic activity of julibroside J8, a natural product isolated from Albizia julibrissin.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-angiogenic properties of julibroside J(8), a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Albizia julibrissin. METHODS: In the presence of juliborside J(8,) the growth of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), four human tumor cell lines, and a normal cell line (MRC-5) was evaluated by MTT assay. The in vivo anti-angiogenic effect of julibroside J(8) was evaluated on a chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) and in transplanted colon carcinoma cells in a nude mice neovascularisation model. RESULTS: Treatment with 0.5-4 microg/ml julibroside J(8) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of growth, migration, and tube formation in HMEC-1 cells; julibroside J(8) also inhibited the formation of microvessels on CAM at a concentration of 10-50 microg/egg and reduced vessel density within tumor at a concentration of 0.5-3mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: Julibroside J(8) may be a potent anti-angiogenetic and cytotoxic drug; further investigation is warranted.",M2
19407978,"Inhibitory effects of clotrimazole on TNF-alpha-induced adhesion molecule expression and angiogenesis.Cell adhesion molecules play a pivotal role in chronic inflammation and pathological angiogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of clotrimazole (CLT) on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced changes in adhesion molecule expression. CLT dose-dependently inhibited monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expressions in TNF-alpha-stimulated HT29 colonic epithelial cells. This inhibitory action of CLT correlated with a significant reduction in TNF-alpha-induced adhesion of monocytes to HT29 cells, which was comparable to the inhibitory effects of anti-ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies on monocyte-epithelial adhesion. These inhibitory actions of CLT were, at least in part, attributable to the inhibition of redox sensitive NF-kappaB activation, as CLT inhibited TNF-alpha-induced ROS generation as well as NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and activation in HT29 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced monocyte adhesion was also mimicked by the specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Inflammatory mediators including TNF-alpha have known to promote angiogenesis, which in turn further contributes to inflammatory pathology. Therefore, we additionally evaluated whether CLT modulates TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis using in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. The CAM assay showed that CLT dose-dependently attenuated TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis, and the effect was correlated with decreased inflammation of the CAM tissue. In conclusion, our results suggest that CLT can inhibit TNF-alpha-triggered expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and angiogenesis during inflammation.",M2
19405043,"Inhibitory effects of a gradient static magnetic field on normal angiogenesis.Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is critical in many normal and pathological processes such as development, reproduction, tumor growth, and metastasis. Recently, exposure to moderate-intensity static magnetic fields (1 mT to 1 T) has attracted much attention for its potential therapeutic value as a noninvasive intervening method. Nevertheless, the effects of moderate-intensity and spatial gradient static magnetic fields (GSMF) on angiogenesis have not received enough attention. In this study, the effects of GSMF (0.2-0.4 T, 2.09 T/m, 1-11 days) on angiogenesis were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. An MTT assay was used as an in vitro method to detect the proliferation ability of human umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs). Two kinds of in vivo models, a chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) and a matrigel plug, were used to detect the effects of GSMF on angiogenesis. The results showed that the proliferation ability of HUVECs was significantly inhibited 24 h after the onset of exposure. With regard to the CAM model, vascular numbers in the CAM that was continuously exposed to the GSMF were all less than those in normal condition. In accordance with the gross appearance, the contents of hemoglobin in the models exposed to GSMF for 7-9 days were also less. In addition, similar to the CAM model, the results of vascular density and hemoglobin contents in the matrigel plug also demonstrated that the GSMF exposure for 7 or 11 days inhibited vascularization. These findings indicate that GSMF might inhibit or prevent new blood vessels formation and could be helpful for the treatment of some diseases relevant to pathological angiogenesis.",M2

METHOD: The eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis were transplanted into the nonvascular region of 8-day-old chicken embryo chorioallantocic membrane (<e>CAM</e>), and the effects of NF-kappaB p65 siRNA on the vascularization and endometriotic lesion formation were tested with proper controls. RESULTS: Transplantation of the endometrium onto the CAM resulted in a strong angiogenic response in the chicken tissue. The angiogenesis was significantly reduced and endometriotic lesion formation significantly suppressed with siRNA targeting NF-kappaB in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The NF-kappaB pathway is involved in the development of endometriotic lesions in vitro, and NF-kappaB gene silencing reduces endometriotic angiogenesis and promotes cell apoptosis in the endometriotic lesions, suggesting that NF-kappaB might be a good target for endometriosis treatment.",M2
19401151,"The soluble form of the cancer-associated L1 cell adhesion molecule is a pro-angiogenic factor.A soluble form of the L1 cell adhesion molecule (sL1) is released from various tumor cells and can be found in serum and ascites fluid of uterine and ovarian carcinoma patients. sL1 is a ligand for several Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-binding integrins and can be deposited in the extracellular matrix. In this study we describe a novel function of this physiologically relevant form of L1 as a pro-angiogenic factor. We demonstrated that the anti-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) chCE7 binds near or to the sixth Ig-like domain of human L1 which contains a single RGD sequence. mAb chCE7 inhibited the RGD-dependent adhesion of ovarian carcinoma cells to sL1 and reversed the sL1-induced proliferation, matrigel invasion and tube formation of bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells. A combination of sL1 with vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A(165)), which is an important angiogenic inducer in tumors, strongly potentiated VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in BAE cells. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assays revealed the pro-angiogenic potency of sL1 in vivo which could be abolished by chCE7. These results indicate an important role of released L1 in tumor angiogenesis and represent a novel function of antibody chCE7 in tumor therapy.",M2
19373610,"Suppression of tumor growth by palm tocotrienols via the attenuation of angiogenesis.Previous studies have revealed that tocotrienol-rich fractions (TRF) from palm oil inhibit the proliferation and the growth of solid tumors. The anticancer activity of TRF is said to be caused by several mechanisms, one of which is antiangiogenesis. In this study, we looked at the antiangiogenic effects of TRF. In vitro investigations of the antiangiogenic activities of TRF, delta-tocotrienol (deltaT3), and alpha-tocopherol (alphaToc) were carried out in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). TRF and deltaT3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation from 4 microg/ml onward (P &lt; 0.05). Cell migration was inhibited the most by deltaT3 at 12 microg/ml. Anti-angiogenic properties of TRF were carried out further in vivo using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay and BALB/c mice model. TRF at 200 microg/ml reduced the vascular network on CAM. TRF treatment of 1 mg/mouse significantly reduced 4T1 tumor volume in BALB/c mice. TRF significantly reduced serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in BALB/c mice. In conclusion, this study showed that palm tocotrienols exhibit anti-angiogenic properties that may assist in tumor regression.",M2
19370348,"Antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects of substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives is mediated by down regulation of VEGF and inhibition of translocation of HIF-1alpha in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells.PURPOSE: 1,3,4-Oxadiazoles are an important class of heterocyclic compounds, which play a pivotal role in various pharmaceutical applications. Here, we investigated the antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects of the derivatives and explored its mechanism of action on EAT cells. METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of the derivatives on EAT and HEK293 cells was assessed by MTT assay. Effect of the derivatives on ALP activity and proliferation was measured. Swiss albino mice transplanted with EAT cells were used as a model system to study the effect of the derivatives in vivo. Inhibition of angiogenesis in mice peritoneum, <e>CAM</e> and Cornea of the rat were studied. Finally, the effects on VEGF gene expression, HIF-1alpha translocation and cell cycle arrest were determined. RESULTS: The IC50 range for growth inhibition of EAT cells was found to be 140-175 microM. In contrast normal HEK293 cells were resistant to the derivatives at this range. Treatment with derivatives in vivo was demonstrated by the down regulation of VEGF in EAT cells and inhibition of blood vessels formation in mice peritoneum, CAM and cornea of rat, indicating the potent angioinhibitory effect of the derivatives. VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter gene expression analysis showed suppression of VEGF gene expression in vitro. The derivatives proved to be potent antiproliferative agents as shown by FACS analysis and decreased ALP activity. Furthermore, expression of HIF-1alpha was also down regulated by derivatives by repressing its nuclear translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Oxadiazole derivatives are strong bioactive compounds with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative potential both in vitro and in vivo. We postulate that diminished HIF-1alpha nuclear presence in oxadiazole treated EAT cells could be responsible for decreased VEGF expression and antiangiogenic effects.",M2
19364272,"Enhancement of embryonic stem cell differentiation promoted by avian chorioallantoic membranes.Avian chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) has been used as a model to explore angiogenesis and to study the microvasculature of transplanted tissues. Because CAM provides a vascular bed, cells can be implanted, and their development can be monitored and modified. We used the CAM model to study the differentiation process of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) influenced by the CAM vascular bed. After EBs were incubated in CAM for 5 days, they underwent further differentiation and became tissue masses (TMs) of different morphologies from those that grew outside CAM. Immunohistochemical analysis of TMs demonstrated tissue-specific markers such as neurofilament light, CD34, collagen IV, cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC), and cardiotin. Differentiated mouse blood vessels stained with anti-CD31 were found within the TMs, as well as blood vessels stained positive for QH1 and QCPN, markers for quail endothelial cells and perinuclear quail antigen, respectively. Quail erythrocytes inside mouse blood vessels suggested a connection between existing quail vessels and blood vessels growing inside the TMs as a result of EB differentiation. Therefore, CAM could be a suitable model to trigger and study the differentiation of EBs in close interaction with surrogate quail blood vessels.",M2

METHODS: Three pairs of hVEGF siRNA-plasmid and non-silencing-plasmid were constructed, and transfected into A549 cells through lipofectamine 2000, respectively. The most effective pair of hVEGF siRNA-plasmid was selected by ELISA and real-time RT-PCR. A549 cells transfected with selected hVEGF siRNA- plasmid, A549 cells transfected with non-silencing-plasmid and A549 cells without transfection were inoculated into nude mice, respectively. Chick embryos were randomly divided into four groups and CAM was treated by different solutions for 48 h: culture media DMEM as negative control group,un-transfected A549 cell culture supernatants as positive control group, hVEGF siRNA A549 cell culture supernatants as hVEGF siRNA group and nonsilencing siRNA A549 cell culture supernatants as non-silencing siRNA group. The CAMs were harvested on d12 for microscopic assays. RESULT: Compared with control group, hVEGF siRNA-plasmid induced 48% reduction in hVEGF secretion by A549 cells accompanied by 70% reduction in hVEGF mRNA. Compared with non-silencing siRNA group, the mean tumor volume of murine xenograft was reduced by 58% in hVEGF siRNA group; time for xenografts growing to 50 mm(3)was delayed by 5.4 d. hVEGF contents in xenograft were reduced by 54%; but mean doubling time of tumors and the growth rate of tumors were not significantly reduced. In CAM assays, hVEGF content was zero in negative group, and in hVEGF siRNA group that was 40%-44% of non-silencing siRNA group or positive group; vessels branch points of CAM in hVEGF siRNA group or non-silencing siRNA group or positive group were increased by 45%-55% compared with negative group; total vessel length of CAM in hVEGF siRNA group was increased by 53% compared with negative group, while in non-silencing siRNA group or positive group that was increased by 97% or 99%. Compared with negative control group, the proliferation of microvessels was increased when cell culture supernatant with hVEGF was added in hVEGF siRNA group, significant proliferated vessels were observed in non-silencing siRNA group or positive group. Conclusion: A plasmid-mediated hVEGF siRNA has been constructed and verified, which can effectively downregulate the expression of hVEGF in human A549 cells, resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis. hVEGF siRNA can delay initial growth of A549 tumor xenograft but not reduce the growth rate.",M2
19357149,"Anti-angiogenic activity of carebastine: a plausible mechanism affecting airway remodelling.Ebastine is a well-known selective second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antagonist, which is used for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the development of airway inflammation and remodelling in allergic rhinitis and asthmatic patients, in whom, indeed, the mucosa displays increased vascularity and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-angiogenic properties of carebastine, the active metabolite of ebastine. The effects of carebastine on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC) (HUVEC) and human pulmonary artery EC (HPAEC) proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation were investigated in vitro, and in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay in vivo. Moreover, the effect of carebastine on phosphorylation of the cell VEGF receptor fetal liver kinase-1, or VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), and Akt kinase (Akt) was evaluated by Western blotting. Carebastine inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC and HPAEC proliferation, migration and angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Cell proliferation was inhibited by 42 and 64% in HUVECs and 62 and 75% in HPAECs upon exposure for 48 and 72 h, respectively, to 20 microM carebastine (p &lt; or = 0.03), and even more with 30 microM carebastine. Cell migration was inhibited by 37 and 70% in HUVECs (p &lt; or = 0.03) and 60 and 78% in HPAECs (p &lt; or = 0.01) in the presence of 10 and 30 microM carebastine, respectively. Carebastine (20 microM) caused a significant reduction (70-86%; p&lt;0.01) in topological parameters of the capillary network produced in vitro by both EC lines on a basement membrane extract. Carebastine (30 and 50 microM) inhibited the VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay in vivo two- and three-fold, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Finally, both EC lines, on exposure to 10 and 20 microM carebastine, showed a four- to six-fold reduction (p &lt; or = 0.01) in both VEGF- and H1 receptor-induced VEGFR-2 and Akt phosphorylation. Overall, these data provide the first evidence regarding the anti-angiogenic activity of ebastine, and suggest its potential use as an anti-angiogenic molecule, besides its antihistaminic activity for the treatment of allergic diseases in which angiogenesis takes place.",M2
19345347,"Matrix metalloproteinase messenger RNA expression in human endometriosis grafts cultured on a chicken chorioallantoic membrane.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (MMP-1/MMP-2) in human endometrial explants in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model (<e>CAM</e>) of endometriosis. DESIGN: Experimental prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Endometrium samples obtained from ovulating women, both healthy and patients with endometriosis, who were undergoing curettage and diagnostic laparoscopy for benign gynecologic conditions. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial grafts were transplanted to the CAM and cultured for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) was quantified by competitive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and normalized to expression of the housekeeping gene human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. RESULT(S): All grafts expressed MMP-1 and MMP-2 mRNA. The endometrium of healthy women and patients with endometriosis showed a statistically significant increase of MMP-1 mRNA expression 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after transfer to the CAM. An increase of MMP-2 mRNA expression was only detected after 96 hours of CAM culture in patients with and without endometriosis. No statistically significant difference regarding the MMP-1 and MMP-2 mRNA expression could be shown in healthy women or endometriosis patients. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggest that MMP-1 and MMP-2 are major factors involved in the invasion of endometrium into the peritoneum and in vascularization of endometriosis. Whether MMPs are suitable targets for treatment of endometriosis has to be examined in further studies.",M2
19343663,"Membrane transport enhancement of chlorin e6-polyvinylpyrrolidone and its photodynamic efficacy on the chick chorioallantoic model.We have determined the influences of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the topical delivery of chlorin e6 (Ce6) in malignant bladder cells. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) was used to model the tumor spheroids that resemble small residual bladder tumors prior to vascularization. Macroscopic fluorescence imaging showed that Ce6-PVP-induced fluorescence had a higher sensitivity and specificity for delineating tumor from the adjacent normal CAM compared to Ce6 alone. Nonlinear regression analyses have shown that Ce6-PVP has a longer half-life in the tumor compared to Ce6. The uptake ratio of Ce6-PVP was found to have a 2-fold increase across the CAM when compared to that of Ce6, indicating that PVP was able to facilitate diffusion of Ce6 across the membrane. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further confirmed that Ce6-PVP has better penetration in the CAM as well as in the tumor cells compared to Ce6. The present work contributes to our understanding of the Ce6-PVP drug-polymer system by demonstrating for the first time that the presence of PVP facilitates the transport of Ce6 across the chorioallantoic membrane.",M2
19336888,"Involvement of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase in cardiotoxin III-induced apoptosis of K562 cells.Cardiotoxin III (CTX III), a 60-amino acid basic polypeptide isolated from Naja venom, showed potential therapeutic activity toward cancer cells. Here we report that CTX III inhibited proliferation of human leukemia K562 cells by G2/M phase arresting and apoptosis which was associated with the activation of caspase-8 and cytochrome c release as well as the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) phosphorylation signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that daily administration of CTX III for 2 d to chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) bearing tumours derived from the CAM at E10 administration of K562 cells resulted in inhibition of the tumours in vivo. Importantly, this in vivo inhibition was also associated with caspase-8 activation and cytochrome c release. Our results suggest that CTX III-induced apoptosis is mediated via the p38 and JNK pathway as well as the caspase-8-dependent Bid-Bax pathway in human K562 cells.",M2
19284324,"Fluocinolone inhibits VEGF expression via glucocorticoid receptor in human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells and TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>).PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether fluocinolone inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in a retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) and TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. METHODS: The dose-dependent effect of fluocinolone (0.0001-1 microM) on VEGF secretion, VEGF mRNA expression, and cytotoxicity was determined in confluent monolayers of ARPE-19 cells using ELISA, RT-PCR, and MTT assay, respectively. The effect of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (RU486) on fluocinolone-mediated VEGF expression was determined. The effect of fluocinolone in inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis was determined using chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The dose-dependent effect of fluocinolone (0.0001-1 microM) in inhibiting 1% serum-stimulated ARPE-19 cell proliferation was determined using BrdU labeling assay. RESULTS: At concentrations devoid of cytotoxicity, fluocinolone inhibited VEGF secretion as well as mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells. RU486 (1 microM) treatment prevented inhibition of VEGF secretion and VEGF mRNA expression by fluocinolone (0.1 microM). Fluocinolone (50 ng/egg) inhibited angiogenesis induced by TNF-alpha. The ARPE-19 cell proliferation was inhibited by fluocinolone in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Fluocinolone inhibited VEGF expression in ARPE-19 cells via its glucocorticoid receptor activity. In addition, fluocinolone inhibited proliferation of ARPE-19 cells and TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membranes.",M2
19277014,"Intravascularly administered RGD-displaying measles viruses bind to and infect neovessel endothelial cells in vivo.Systemically administered vectors must cross the endothelial lining of tumor blood vessels to access cancer cells. Vectors that interact with markers on the lumenal surface of these endothelial cells might have enhanced tumor localization. Here, we generated oncolytic measles viruses (MVs) displaying alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-binding peptides, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) or echistatin, on the measles hemagglutinin protein. Both viruses had expanded tropisms, and efficiently entered target cells via binding to integrins, but also retained their native tropisms for CD46 and signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM). When fluorescently labeled and injected intravascularly into chick chorioallantoic membranes (<e>CAMs</e>), in contrast to unmodified viruses, the integrin-binding viral particles bound to the lumenal surface of the developing chick neovessels and infected the CAM vascular endothelial cells. In a mouse model of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the ear pinna, the integrin-binding viruses, but not the parental virus, infected cells at sites of new blood vessel formation. When given intravenously to mice bearing tumor xenografts, the integrin-binding virus infected endothelial cells of tumor neovessels in addition to tumor parenchyma. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that oncolytic MVs can be engineered to target the lumenal endothelial surface of newly formed blood vessels when administered intravenously in living animals.",M2
19226840,"An alternative test battery in detecting ocular irritancy of agrochemicals.Using animals in toxicological screening is a controversial issue. To get knowledge about eye irritation, recently only the in vivo Draize-test is accepted, which is one of the most criticized methods because of the injuries inflicted on the test animals. In recent years various in vitro methods have been developed to replace the primary irritation test. Most of these tests are in process of validation. The Draize rabbit eye test, or some modification of this test is essentially the only method for determining ocular irritation that is accepted by authorities. Several in vitro methods have been used to investigate the toxicity of potential eye irritants with the aim of replacing in vitro eye irritation testing. This study reports the results of an alternative approach for predicting irritation potential of agrochemicals. The approach was a two-stage test battery in vitro. The first stage was a cytotoxicity test, the MTT assay. The second stage was the HET-<e>CAM</e> test. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), being a connective tissue sheet with a visible blood supply, has been proposed as a substrate to identify the eye irritation potential of chemicals. During the HET-CAM test the chemicals are placed directly onto the chorioallantoic membrane. The changes of the vascular injury (haemorrhage, lysis or coagulation) are indications of the potential of the chemical to damage mucous membranes in vivo. MTT assay is a simple method to determine the viability of cells in the presence of a chemical. Cells are cultured with several concentrations of a substance or product, then the ratio of cell destruction is determined. LCC50 (concentration lethal for the 50 % of the cells) is assessed. This is in correlation of the eye irrigative potential of the chemical. In our studies comparative screening was performed with 6 agrochemicals to establish parallel data on alternative test battery (HET-CAM, MTT) and in vivo (Draize) results. In most cases, this study showed a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo data. By these results the present form of an alternative test battery (HET-CAM and MTT) can be proposed as a prescreen method of eye irritation tests.",M2
19196466,"Immunohistochemistry for detection of avian infectious bronchitis virus strain M41 in the proventriculus and nervous system of experimentally infected chicken embryos.BACKGROUND: Infectious bronchitis virus primarily induces a disease of the respiratory system, different IBV strains may show variable tissue tropisms and also affect the oviduct and the kidneys. Proventriculitis was also associated with some new IBV strains. Aim of this study was to investigate by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the tissue tropism of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 in experimentally infected chicken embryos. RESULTS: To this end chicken embryos were inoculated in the allantoic sac with 10(3) EID(50) of IBV M41 at 10 days of age. At 48, 72, and 120 h postinoculation (PI), embryos and chorioallantoic membranes (<e>CAM</e>) were sampled, fixed, and paraffin-wax embedded. Allantoic fluid was also collected and titrated in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK). The sensitivity of IHC in detecting IBV antigens in the CAM of inoculated eggs matched the virus reisolation and detection in CEK. Using IHC, antigens of IBV were detected in nasal epithelium, trachea, lung, spleen, myocardial vasculature, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, sclera of the eye, spinal cord, as well as in brain neurons of the inoculated embryos. These results were consistent with virus isolation and denote the wide tissue tropism of IBV M41 in the chicken embryo. Most importantly, we found infection of vasculature and smooth muscle of the proventriculus which has not seen before with IBV strain M41. CONCLUSION: IHC can be an additional useful tool for diagnosis of IBV infection in chickens and allows further studies to foster a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of infections with IBV strains of different virulence. Moreover, these results underline that embryonic tissues in addition to CAM could be also used as possible source to generate IBV antigens for diagnostic purposes.",M2
19193181,"Screening of nanoparticulate delivery systems for the photodetection of cancer in a simple and cost-effective model.AIMS: In urology, fluorescence-based imaging methods have been proven to significantly improve the detection of small, barely visible tumors and reduce the recurrence rate. Under ethical and economical pressure, new effective screening systems have to be developed to exploit and assess novel strategies for fluorescence photodetection in other areas. For this purpose, the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of the developing chick embryo is an attractive alternative model to the mammalian models. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Hypericin encapsulated into nanoparticles for the photodetection of ovarian metastases was evaluated in the CAM model with respect to vascular extravazation and tumor targeting and compared with free drug following intravenous administration. RESULTS: To validate the CAM model as a valuable screening system for photodetection of cancer, we drew a comparison with results obtained on a conventional rodent model. CONCLUSION: Rodent and CAM models led to the same conclusion regarding the benefits of nanoencapsulation to improve selective accumulation of drug in ovarian micrometastases.",M2

19157806,"Anisotropic diffusion deviates chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay (<e>CAM</e>) to reflect inherent therapeutic behaviors.Chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM) has become a widely used tool for determination of anti-angiogenesis capability of many drugs including herbal extracts. Because varying results in same set of chicken embryos are often encountered, we developed the complex diffusion model that combined the Fick's second diffusion law, chemical-protein interaction (or binding) to explain the diffusion- or kinetic-limiting phenomena in egg white when performing CAM. In addition, we performed diffusion studies in egg white with Color Blue No. 1, Evans Blue, Color Red No. 40, and the aqueous extract of Psidium guajava budding leaves (PE) to support our model. Under same conditions, the diffusion coefficients of Blue No. 1, Evans Blue, Red No. 40, and PE were (2.0-2.8)x10(-9), (0.89-31)x10(-9), (2.8-12)x10(-9), and (7.0-21)x10(-9)m(2)s(-1), respectively, depending upon the distance diffused. Whilst at the interface of egg white and embryo (egg yolk), a site about 1cm apart from the aeration sac, the percent concentration reached only 10.5, 3.0, 3.6, and 2.2% of the original applied medicine, respectively. We conclude that CAM could only serve as a preliminary screening tool for angiogenesis, because the anisotropic diffusion in egg white affects greatly the effective dosages of medicines tested.",M2
19150583,"An alternative in vivo system for testing angiogenic potential of human neuroblastoma cells.In this study we purposed an alternative method to study the angiogenic and invasive potential of neuroblastoma cell suspensions implanted on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) surface. Neuroblastoma cells were seeded in Matrigel and thereafter the suspension was pipetted onto the CAM surface at day 8 of incubation inside a silicon ring previously loaded onto the CAM surface. Four days after implantation, the silicon ring was removed and the angiogenic and invasive response were studied morphologically at macroscopic and microscopic levels and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using human and chicken primers for several angiogenic cytokines, namely vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1), hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha), and for an endogenous angiostatic molecule, namely endostatin. Results showed that: (1) Neuroblastoma cells induced an angiogenic response in the CAM assay comparable to that induced by FGF-2; (2) neuroblastoma cells are packed inside Matrigel or are recognizable in the CAM mesenchyme; (3) Angiogenic activity of neuroblastoma cells is associated to an high expression of the transcripts of human VEGF-A, FGF-2, ANG-1 and HIF-2alpha and to a low expression in the transcript of a human endostatin while in the control specimens there is no expression of both angiogenic and angiostatic molecules; and (4) the expression of the transcripts of the same chicken angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitor is unmodified in treated and control specimens. Overall, these data indicate that neuroblastoma cells growth on the chick CAM express characteristics of the human disease. This experimental model could be employed for further research on human tumor progression and anti-angiogenic molecules screening.",M2
19133127,"In-vivo optical detection of cancer using chlorin e6--polyvinylpyrrolidone induced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy.BACKGROUND: Photosensitizer based fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy is fast becoming a promising approach for cancer detection. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) formulated in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a potential exogenous fluorophore for fluorescence imaging and spectroscopic detection of human cancer tissue xenografted in preclinical models as well as in a patient. METHODS: Fluorescence imaging was performed on MGH human bladder tumor xenografted on both the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) and the murine model using a fluorescence endoscopy imaging system. In addition, fiber optic based fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on tumors and various normal organs in the same mice to validate the macroscopic images. In one patient, fluorescence imaging was performed on angiosarcoma lesions and normal skin in conjunction with fluorescence spectroscopy to validate Ce6-PVP induced fluorescence visual assessment of the lesions. RESULTS: Margins of tumor xenografts in the CAM model were clearly outlined under fluorescence imaging. Ce6-PVP-induced fluorescence imaging yielded a specificity of 83% on the CAM model. In mice, fluorescence intensity of Ce6-PVP was higher in bladder tumor compared to adjacent muscle and normal bladder. Clinical results confirmed that fluorescence imaging clearly captured the fluorescence of Ce6-PVP in angiosarcoma lesions and good correlation was found between fluorescence imaging and spectral measurement in the patient. CONCLUSION: Combination of Ce6-PVP induced fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy could allow for optical detection and discrimination between cancer and the surrounding normal tissues. Ce6-PVP seems to be a promising fluorophore for fluorescence diagnosis of cancer.",M2
19123663,"Quantitative and morphometric evaluation of the angiogenic effects of leptin.Angiogenesis is a dynamic process that requires an interaction of pro-and antiangiogenic factors. It is known that the cytokine leptin stimulates endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis, but further quantitative analysis is necessary to understand leptin angiogenic effects. The quail chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay has been used to study angiogenesis in vivo by focusing on morphometric parameters that quantify vascular complexity and density. We quantify the angiogenic activity of leptin using the CAM assay by digital morphometry and a computer-assisted image analysis to evaluate more precisely vessel length, diameter, branching, and tortuousity. CAM images are obtained from ex ovo cultures of E8-E9 quail embryos. MATLAB and custom software are used for our analysis. The effects of leptin, vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF(165)), and their corresponding neutralizing antibodies are compared. Our results show that CAM treated with leptin and VEGF(165) has a significant increase in vascular complexity and density. A corresponding decrease is observed using neutralizing antibodies. Notably, leptin induced more significant changes than VEGF in vessel length and tortuousity. Conversely, VEGF induced a greater increase in vessel branching than leptin. These results underscore the importance of using multiparametric quantitative methods to assess several aspects of angiogenesis and enable us to understand the proangiogenic effects of leptin.",M2
19123068,"Inducible expression of human angiostatin by AOXI promoter in P. pastoris using high-density cell culture.A high-density cell culture method was successfully established in P. pastoris with the alcohol oxidase I (AOXI) promoter in order to produce large quantities of recombinant human angiostatin (AS) which has been reported to have antiangiogenic activity. A preliminary study on fermentation conditions in shaking flasks indicated that adequacy of biomass is beneficial to obtain more products. The fermentation was carried out in a 10 l bioreactor with 5 l modified growth medium recommended by Invitrogen at 30 degrees C. The cells were first grown in glycerol-PTM4 trace salts for 24 h. When the cell density reached A(600) = 125, methanol-PTM4 trace salts was added to induce the expression of AS. During the fermentation, dissolved oxygen level was maintained at 20-30%, pH was controlled at 5 by the addition of 7 M NH(4)OH and the biomass was maintained at about A(600) = 200. After 60 h of induction, the secreted AS was 153 mg/l. The recombinant AS inhibited the angiogenesis on <e>CAM</e> and suppressed the growth of B16 melanoma in C57BL/6J mice (P \0.01).",M2
20218518,"Eye irritation study of some pesticides on chorioallantoic membrane of the egg.The chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo has been used extensively for many years in various fields of biological research, including virology, bacteriology and toxicology. The chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) is a complete tissue that responds to injury with a complete inflammatory reaction, this process similar to that induced by chemicals in the conjunctival tissue of the rabbit eye. A possible model for assessing the irritation potential of a chemical or product to such a vascularised tissue is the choriallantoic membrane of the embryonated hen's egg, as this is a highly vascular, thin membrane with relatively easy access for both treatment and assessment. In recent years various in vitro methods have been developed to replace the heavily criticized Draize rabbit eye test for irritation testing. One of the most studied alternative methods is the Hen's Egg Test - Chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM). In our studies a comparative screening was done with a set of pesticides to establish parallel data on in vitro (HET-CAM) and in vivo (Draize) results. In most cases good correlation was found between the HET-CAM assessment and results from the Draize rabbit eye test. The actual form of the HET-CAM test is a valuable pre-screen for predicting ocular irritation potential of chemicals, and can be used to reduce the number of experimental animals. The HET-CAM test is useful as a part of a battery of tests to replace the Draize rabbit eye test.",M2
19081537,"Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane as a useful tool to study angiogenesis.The chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) is an extraembryonic membrane mediating gas and nutrient exchanges until hatching. Since it has a dense capillary network, it has been commonly used in vivo to study both angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis in response to normal tissues and cells, to tumor bioptic specimens and cells, or to soluble factors. During the last 8 years, this assay has been used in over 550 published works. This chapter summarizes current knowledge about the embryological origin of the CAM, morphology of its blood and lymphatic vessels, the use of CAM in the study of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, angiogenic and antiangiogenic substances. The angiogenic response of CAM to multiple myeloma and neuroblastoma cells and bioptic specimens and their responses to antiangiogenic molecules and the role played by fibroblast growth factor-2 in CAM vascularization have been analyzed in detail. Finally, advantages and limitations of CAM as an experimental model to study angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis are discussed.",M2
19054059,"The human skin/chick chorioallantoic membrane model accurately predicts the potency of cosmetic allergens.The current standard method for predicting contact allergenicity is the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). Public objection to the use of animals in testing of cosmetics makes the development of a system that does not use sentient animals highly desirable. The chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of the chick egg has been extensively used for the growth of normal and transformed mammalian tissues. The CAM is not innervated, and embryos are sacrificed before the development of pain perception. The aim of this study was to determine whether the sensitization phase of contact dermatitis to known cosmetic allergens can be quantified using CAM-engrafted human skin and how these results compare with published EC3 data obtained with the LLNA. We studied six common molecules used in allergen testing and quantified migration of epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) as a measure of their allergic potency. All agents with known allergic potential induced statistically significant migration of LC. The data obtained correlated well with published data for these allergens generated using the LLNA test. The human-skin CAM model therefore has great potential as an inexpensive, non-radioactive, in vivo alternative to the LLNA, which does not require the use of sentient animals. In addition, this system has the advantage of testing the allergic response of human, rather than animal skin.",M2
19007659,"Chapter 2. Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane models to quantify angiogenesis induced by inflammatory and tumor cells or purified effector molecules.Angiogenesis plays a critical role in many normal physiological processes as well as in tumor neovascularization associated with cancer progression. Among various animal model systems designed to study the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis, chick embryo models have been useful tools in analyzing the angiogenic potential of purified factors and intact cells. The chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>), a specialized, highly vascularized tissue of the avian embryo, serves as an ideal indicator of the anti- or pro-angiogenic properties of test compounds. In this chapter, we describe a number basic chick embryo CAM models of angiogenesis. A special emphasis is on the model system employing three-dimensional (3D) collagen grafts planted on the CAM, referred herein as onplants. This collagen onplant model allows for unambiguous quantification of angiogenesis and also for in-depth analysis of the cellular and biochemical mechanisms by which specific cells of different origin or purified effector molecules induce or inhibit the angiogenic process.",M2
19005674,"Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model systems to study and visualize human tumor cell metastasis.Since their introduction almost a century ago, chick embryo model systems involving the technique of chorioallantoic grafting have proved invaluable in the in vivo studies of tumor development and angiogenesis and tumor cell dissemination. The ability of the chick embryo's chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) to efficiently support the growth of inoculated xenogenic tumor cells greatly facilitates analysis of human tumor cell metastasis. During spontaneous metastasis, the highly vascularized CAM sustains rapid tumor formation within several days following cell grafting. The dense capillary network of the CAM also serves as a repository of aggressive tumor cells that escaped from the primary tumor and intravasated into the host vasculature. This spontaneous metastasis setting provides a unique experimental model to study in vivo the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade. During experimental metastasis when tumor cells are inoculated intravenously, the CAM capillary system serves as a place for initial arrest and then, for tumor cell extravasation and colonization. The tissue composition and accessibility of the CAM for experimental interventions makes chick embryo CAM systems attractive models to follow the fate and visualize microscopically the behavior of grafted tumor cells in both spontaneous and experimental metastasis settings.",M2
18996588,"Sequential delivery of dexamethasone and VEGF to control local tissue response for carbon nanotube fluorescence based micro-capillary implantable sensors.In this study, we examined the in vivo pharmacological effects of the sequential delivery of dexamethasone (DX) followed by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on the immune response and localized vascular network formation around a hydrogel-coated, micro-capillary implant for single-walled carbon nanotube based fluorescence sensors. We demonstrate, for the first time, imaging of an SWNT fluorescence device implanted subcutaneously in a rat. For tissue response studies, the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) was used as a tissue-model for an 8-day implantation period. The average vascular density of the tissue surrounding a hydrogel-coated microdialysis capillary sensor with simultaneous, sequential, or no delivery of DX and VEGF was 1.24+/-0.35x10(-3)vessels/microm(2), 1.15+/-0.30x10(-3)vessels/microm(2) and 0.71+/-0.20x10(-3)vessels/microm(2), respectively. Calculation of the therapeutic index (vasculature/inflammation ratio), which reflects promotion of angiogenesis versus the host immune response, demonstrates that sequential DX/VEGF delivery was 60.3% and 139.3% higher than that of VEGF and DX release alone, respectively, and was also 32.1% higher when compared to simultaneous administration, proving to be a more effective strategy in utilizing the pharmacological impact of DX and VEGF around the biosensor-model implant.",M2
18980833,"Chorioallantoic membrane assays have been based on diffusion control--problems arising with a diversity of mass transfers in egg white.The chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assays have been intensively used to determine angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis of medicines. In view of bioactivity, this technique should be performed with kinetic control regime in chicken embryos. Whether the dosages ever used had satisfied this requirement, we explored by mathematical analysis. A diffusion-in-egg model was established to describe several medicinal diffusions in egg white that involved the instantaneous transient kinetic behavior, the diffusion of medicines in capping volume (the volume from the air sac to the interface of egg yolk). By reviewing the diffusion of various compounds including the cited and the experimentals in this work, we conclude that all the CAM assays ever cited were performed under diffusion control regime rather than kinetic control, which may bring forth deviations caused by a diversity of constitutes in egg white through various medicine-protein interactions.",M2

18853253,"Analysis of N-glycans in embryonated chicken egg chorioallantoic and amniotic cells responsible for binding and adaptation of human and avian influenza viruses.The initial step essential in influenza virus infection is specific binding of viral hemagglutinin to host cell-surface glycan receptors. Influenza A virus specificity for the host is mediated by viral envelope hemagglutinin, that binds to receptors containing glycans with terminal sialic acids. Human viruses preferentially bind to alpha2--&gt;6 linked sialic acids on receptors of host cells, whereas avian viruses are specific for the alpha2--&gt;3 linkage on the target cells. Human influenza virus isolates more efficiently infect amniotic membrane (AM) cells than chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) cells. N-glycans were isolated from AM and CAM cells of 10-day-old chicken embryonated eggs and their structures were analyzed by multi-dimensional HPLC mapping and MALDI-TOF-MS techniques. Terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid contents in the two cell types were similar. However, molar percents of alpha2--&gt;3 linkage preferentially bound by avian influenza virus were 27.2 in CAM cells and 15.4 in AM cells, whereas those of alpha2--&gt;6 linkage favored by human influenza virus were 8.3 (CAM) and 14.2 (AM). Molar percents of sulfated glycans, recognized by human influenza virus, in CAM and AM cells were 3.8 and 12.7, respectively.

METHODS: Chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model was used to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on VEGF- and bFGF-induced angiogenesis. In addition, the effect of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone on endothelial cell migration was evaluated using 8 mm pore filter to a feeder layer containing vitronectin as chemoattractant. RESULTS: Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone inhibited the pro-angiogenic effects of bFGF and VEGF in the CAM model significantly (P &lt; 0.001) to the same extent. Endothelial cell migration was also inhibited by both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PPAR gamma ligands, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, in addition to their important regulatory role in adipogenesis and inflammation, possess anti-angiogenic properties. Thus, PPAR gamma ligands may be useful in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and other ocular disorders and may lower the risk to develop cancer in diabetic patients.",M2
18790036,"Anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-nociceptive activities of Saururus chinensis extract.ETHNOPHARMACOLGICAL RELEVANCE: The aerial parts of Saururus chinensis Baill. are used for the treatment of edema and inflammatory diseases in the Oriental folk medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to elucidate anti-inflammatory and related activities of the ethanol extract (SC) of the dried aerial parts of Saururus chinensis Baill. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-angiogenic and anti-nociceptive activities of SC were analyzed using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay and acetic acid-induced writhing response, respectively. Anti-inflammatory activity of SC was evaluated using acetic acid-induced vascular permeability, carrageenan-induced air pouch formation and analyses of nitrite content and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level in the macrophage cells. RESULTS: SC dose-dependently displayed a strong inhibition in the CAM angiogenesis. SC showed significant anti-nociceptive activity in the writhing model. The anti-inflammatory activity of SC was also assessed in the two in vivo models, such as vascular permeability and air pouch models in mice. SC suppressed production of nitric oxide and induction of iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. CONCLUSION: The aerial parts of Saururus chinensis possess potent anti-angiogenic and anti-nociceptive activities in addition to anti-inflammatory activity, which partly supports its therapeutic efficacy.",M2
18782185,"DTD, an anti-inflammatory ditriazine, inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.The ditriazine derivative DTD (4,10-dichloropyrido[5,6:4,5]thieno[3,2-d':3,2-d]-1,2,3-ditriazine) has been previously reported to reduce the degree of granulomatous inflammation and vascular density in a murine air pouch granuloma model. The aim of this study was to test whether DTD affects angiogenesis. Our results show that DTD inhibits in vivo angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay at doses equal or lower than 0.3 nmol/egg. Different in vitro assays were used to study the potential effects of this compound on key steps of angiogenesis, namely, a colorimetric assay of cell proliferation/viability, a morphogenesis on Matrigel assay, zymographic assays for gelatinases and nuclear morphology and cell cycle analysis for apoptosis induction. Our data indicate that DTD inhibits proliferation but does not induce apoptosis in endothelial cells in vitro. DTD suppresses the endothelial capillary-like chord formation at concentrations lower than those required to inhibit proliferation. DTD treatment inhibits the matrix metalloproteinase-2 production in endothelial and fibrosarcoma cells, but does not affect the cyclooxygenase-2 expression in endothelial cells, as assessed by western blot analysis. Taken together, results here presented indicate that DTD exhibits an anti-angiogenic activity that is independent of inflammatory processes and make it a promising drug for further evaluation in the treatment of angiogenesis-related pathologies.",M2
18782043,"Synthesis and evaluation of 1-benzhydryl-sulfonyl-piperazine derivatives as inhibitors of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis of mouse ehrlich ascites tumor in vivo.A series of novel 1-benzhydryl-sulfonyl-piperazine derivatives 3(a-e) were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1-benzhydryl-piperazine with different sulfonyl chlorides and were characterized by 1H NMR, LC/MS, FTIR and elemental analysis. In the present study, the compounds 3(a-e) exhibited in vivo inhibition of Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cell growth and increased the Median Survival Time (MST) and %ILS of EAT bearing mice. Further treatment of derivatives in vivo resulted in reduction of EAT cell number and ascites formation. The efficacy of the derivatives to inhibit the angiogenesis in vivo was evaluated in tumor bearing mice peritoneum and chorio allantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model. The compounds suppressed the blood vessel formation in vivo in mice peritoneum and in CAM. Among the compounds studied, 3e demonstrated highest tumor inhibitory and anti-angiogenic effects against mouse tumor. However, this phenomenon needs detailed investigation.",M2
18712720,"Angiostatic activity of obtustatin as alpha1beta1 integrin inhibitor in experimental melanoma growth.The presented results show the effect of targeting of collagen receptor, alpha1beta1 integrin expressed on the endothelial cells on the development of experimental melanoma and pathological angiogenesis. Obtustatin, a snake venom KTS-disintegrin, was applied as a specific inhibitor of this integrin. This low molecular weight peptide revealed a potent therapeutic effect on melanoma progression in 2 animal systems, mouse and quail. Its oncostatic effect was related to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Obtustatin inhibited the neovascularization ratio on the <e>CAM</e> embryo of quail, which was pathologically induced by the developing tumor. The i.v. administration of obtustatin completely blocked cancer growth of MV3 human melanoma in nude mice. In B16F10 syngeneic mouse model treatment with the disintegrin revealed a lower effect, although the development of the tumor was significantly reduced for both dosages. The mechanism of obtustatin action is related to the blocking of microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, which undergoes apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner. Summarizing, we present studies of low molecular weight disintegrin, obtustatin as a potential therapeutic compound for treatment of melanoma that contain a high level of vascularization.",M2
18692618,"Oral contraceptives prevent the development of endometriosis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model.BACKGROUND: Fundamental and genetic differences between women in the endometrium may cause some to develop endometriosis, whereas others do not. Oral contraceptives (OC) may have an effect on the endometrium, rendering the development of endometriosis less likely. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrium from women using OC (OCE) and menstrual endometrium (ME) from normal cycling women were transplanted onto the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>), and endometriosis-like lesion formation was evaluated. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in the endometrium from these groups. Microarray data were validated by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Less endometriosis-like lesions were formed after transplantation of OCE than after transplantation of ME (p&lt;.05). Most of the differentially expressed genes belong to the TGFbeta superfamily. Real-time PCR validation revealed that inhibin betaA (INHBA) expression was significantly decreased in OCE as compared to ME. CONCLUSION: OC use affects the characteristics of endometrium, rendering it less potent to develop into endometriosis.",M2
18688635,"Pericytes in the mature chorioallantoic membrane capillary plexus contain desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin: relevance for non-sprouting angiogenesis.The chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) is a frequently used tissue for studying vascular growth and remodeling, notably non-sprouting angiogenesis by formation of transluminal pillars. Vascular pericytes have received increasing attention in the field of angiogenesis research and appear important for pillar growth. Our earlier observation that desmin (DES), but not alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) was expressed in pericytes of the mature CAM capillary plexus after E12 was confirmed by others. However, in different species or vascular beds, either marker or both have been used to identify pericytes, raising the questions if (1) expression of these cytoskeletal proteins really was mutually exclusive; or (2) different types of pericytes existed in the same vascular bed. Using triple labeling with fluorochrome-conjugated markers Sambucus nigra agglutinin, DES or alphaSMA, and DNA-specific YoPro-1, we report here for the first time a delicate filamentous, circumferentially oriented alphaSMA pattern in periendothelial cells of the mature CAM capillary plexus, quite different from the coarser, axially oriented DES pattern. A new method for automatic classification of DNA-staining pattern was applied to compare nuclei of DES- or alphaSMA-positive cells. It predicted colocalisation of both proteins in most capillary pericytes, which was confirmed by double immunostaining for DES and alphaSMA. We conclude that (1) in contrast to published work, DES and alphaSMA are not mutually exclusive in most pericytes; (2) different types of pericytes may co-exist in the same vascular bed; (3) on average, one pericyte is associated with two transluminal pillars; (4) a novel imaging modality may be useful for cell identification in angiogenesis research and elsewhere.",M2
18678496,"TX-2152: a conformationally rigid and electron-rich diyne analogue of FTY720 with in vivo antiangiogenic activity.We designed FTY720 analogues with conformationally rigid and electron-rich acetylenic chains as antiangiogenic agents (the monoyne 1: TX-2148, the diyne 2: TX-2152, the triyne 3: TX-2256). Molecular orbital (MO) calculations of our designed acetylenic analogues and FTY720 showed that the localization of the lowest unoccupied MO and the highest occupied MO increased from phenyl ring to acetylenic chain compared with that of FTY720. These acetylenic analogues were synthesized from p-hydroxyphenylethanol as a starting material. The construction of the acetylenic chain was carried out by an iterative strategy using a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction and desilylative bromination in two steps. The corresponding overall yields of the monoyne 1, the diyne 2, and the triyne 3 were 27% (11 steps), 13% (13 steps), and 10% (15 steps). The in vivo antiangiogenic activities of these acetylenic analogues and FTY720 were evaluated by the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay and compared to the activities of the known antiangiogenic agent TNP-470. The diyne 2 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity (90% inhibition) than FTY720 (77% inhibition) and other acetylenic analogues (the monoyne 1: 42% inhibition, the triyne 3: 60% inhibition), and TNP-470 (82% inhibition) at a dose of 10 microg/CAM, without showing toxicity. The diyne 2 also had potent inhibitory activity at a dose of 5 and 2.5 microg/CAM. These results indicate that the flexibility of C8 alkyl chain of FTY720 is not required for its antiangiogenic activity. We suggest that the diyne 2 (TX-2152) may be a promising candidate as an antiangiogenic agent for antineoplastic drug discovery.",M2
18670619,"Angiogenesis and diabetes: different responses to pro-angiogenic factors in the chorioallantoic membrane assay.Hyperglycemia induces defects in angiogenesis without alteration in the expression of major vascular growth factors in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model. A direct negative effect of hyperglycemia on angiogenesis may participate in failures of  therapeutic angiogenesis  trials. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the response to pro-angiogenic molecules such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is altered by hyperglycemia. Transfected (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] or human embryonic kidney [HEK]) cells overexpressing ACE, ET-1, or VEGF were deposed onto the CAM of hyperglycemic or control embryos. The proangiogenic effect was evaluated 3 d later by angiography and histological analyses. Gene expression in response to these factors was assessed by in situ hybridization. Only VEGF overexpression evoked a proangiogenic response in the CAM from hyperglycemic embryos, upregulating the expression of endogenous VEGF, VEGF-R2, and Tie-2, all of them related to activation of endothelial cells. In conclusion, in a model where hyperglycemia does not alter the major vascular growth factor expression, the negative effect of diabetes on capillary density was overcome only by VEGF overexpression, whereas responses to other vasoactive peptides were practically abolished under hyperglycemic conditions.",M2

18637183,"Fractal parameters and vascular networks: facts &amp; artifacts.BACKGROUND: Several fractal and non-fractal parameters have been considered for the quantitative assessment of the vascular architecture, using a variety of test specimens and of computational tools. The fractal parameters have the advantage of being scale invariant, i.e. to be independent of the magnification and resolution of the images to be investigated, making easier the comparison among different setups and experiments. RESULTS: The success of several commercial and/or free codes in computing the fractal parameters has been tested on well known exact models. Based on such a preliminary study, we selected the code Frac-lac in order to analyze images obtained by visualizing the angiogenetic process occurring in chick Chorio Allontoic Membranes (<e>CAM</e>), assumed to be paradigmatic of a realistic 2D vascular network. Among the parameters investigated, the fractal dimension Df proved to be the most robust estimator for CAM vascular networks. Moreover, only Df was able to discriminate between effective and elusive increases in vascularization after drug-induced angiogenic stimulations on CAMs. CONCLUSION: The fractal dimension Df is likely to be the most promising tool for monitoring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapies in various clinical contexts.",M2

18597703,"Accelerated wound healing of oral soft tissues and angiogenic effect induced by a pool of aminoacids combined to sodium hyaluronate (AMINOGAM).In this study we investigated the property of a new medical substance, in the form of a gel compound containing four aminoacids (glycine, leucine, proline, lysine) and sodium hyaluronate (AMINOGAM), to accelerate the wound healing process of the soft oral tissues and to promote angiogenesis in vivo in the vascular proliferation in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. Furthermore, we investigated the capacity of AMINOGAM to induce the expression of an angiogenic cytokine, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human fibroblasts in vitro. Results showed that AMINOGAM promoted wound healing in post-surgical wounds (after teeth extraction, oral laser surgery with secondary healing without direct suture of the surgical wound, and after dental implant insertion). Stimulated angiogenesis in vivo in the CAM assay and the response was similar to that obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor, a well-known angiogenic cytokine, tested in the same assay, and confirmed by clinical outcomes, which showed reduction of the healing time of oral soft tissues after three different kinds of surgery and also the absence of post-operative infections.",M2
20084772,"Stimulation and inhibition of 5 ALA induced PplX fluorescence in the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma cultivated on the <e>CAM</e> using glucose versus ethanol as modulating agents.The fluorescence properties of biological tissues have been considered as intrinsic parameters to discriminate diseased from normal conditions. In vivo fluorescence diagnosis of cancer is based on special fluorescent dyes and their properties of tumour selective retention. The experimental in vivo model of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos was used for cultivating a murine tumourous system consisting of the SSK II fibrosarcoma. Proto porphyrine (PplX) synthesis in CAM inoculated tissues as well as in native CAM was induced by 5-ALA. The modulation effects of several biochemicals on the 5-ALA induced PplX production were tested. The fibrosarcoma cells have not revealed autofluorescence with distinctively higher signal intensities than the substrate tissue. Fibrosarcoma cells are clearly distinguished by higher xenofluorescence intensities compared to the CAM tissue in the background. 5-ALA induced xenofluorescence intensity in fibrosarcoma was significantly enhanced by glucose and inhibited by ethanol. It can be concluded that some chemical agents can modulate the intensity of 5-ALA induced xenofluorescence through their modulation the enzymatic cell activity and these can be used for improvement by varying both the diagnostic and the therapeutic effectiveness of the photosensitizers in its application in the photo therapy process.",M2
18575783,"Inhibition of angiogenesis by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor PJ-34.Angiogenesis-related treatments have a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging from cancer to macular degeneration, to wound healing. Thus, the identification of pharmacological agents that modulate new blood vessel formation has attracted much attention. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor PJ-34 [N-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide] on angiogenesis. Treatment of chicken chorioallantoic membranes (<e>CAM</e>) with PJ-34 reduced vascular length in these tissues; paradoxically, lower doses of PJ-34 (0.03 or 0.3 nmol/cm2) were more effective in inhibiting neovascularisation than higher doses (3 or 30 nmol/cm2). In vitro, incubation of endothelial cells (EC) with PJ-34 (300 nM to 10 microM) inhibited their proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 22.3% being observed at 10 microM. Capillary morphogenesis of EC grown on Matrigel was also negatively affected by PJ-34. In addition, PJ-34 abolished the migratory response to the prototype angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and reduced VEGF-stimulated activation of members of the mitogen activated protein kinase family (ERK1/2, p38), as well as Akt. PJ-34 also inhibited VEGF-induced NO release and cGMP accumulation. In conclusion, we provide evidence that PARP inhibition blocks angiogenesis-related EC properties by interfering with multiple signalling pathways leading to the inhibition of new blood vessel formation.",M2
18543387,"Angiogenic effects of the extracts from Chinese herbs: Angelica and Chuanxiong.Angelica and ChuanXiong are used to cure ischemic heart disease in China. Previous studies found that these two herbs could increase myocardial blood flow, oxygen-supply and keep myocardial oxygen balance, etc. However, the mechanisms of angiogenic effects of these two herbs are not well-known. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of Angelica and ChuanXiong on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in rat myocardial infarction, on endothelial cell proliferation and quantity of vessels on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>). In this study, rats were divided randomly into either pre-treatment or acute-treatment group and sacrificed at the end of the treatments. VEGF expression using Western blot analysis was significantly increased in the groups pre-treated with ChuanXiong and Angelica when compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). There was significant increase in VEGF expression in the rats treated acutely with Angelica (p &lt; 0.05). In the contrary, the rats treated with ChuanXiong showed a decrease in VEGF expression when compared to the acute-treatment control group (p &lt; 0.05). Similar results were observed in immunohistochemistry of VEGF expression in the myocardia. Our study also demonstrated that these two herbs significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation (p &lt; 0.05) and revascularity in CAM (p &lt; 0.05). The data showed that Angelica and ChuanXiong could affect VEGF expression in rat myocardial infarction, promote endothelial cell proliferation and stimulate quantity of vessels on CAM model. The results suggest that Angelica and ChuanXiong have angiogenic effects, and may provide some mechanisms for the treatment of myocardial infarction and peripheral ischemia.",M2

On day 7 of chick embryo incubation, three concentrations of S. nigrum aqueous extracts were applied to CAMs, and their effects were evaluated on day 9. RESULT: The angiogenesis area was significantly smaller in the CAM treated with S. nigrum than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Pathology analysis indicated that less angiogenesis occurred in the tissue of CAM under the filter paper treated with S. nigrum and the structure of large arteries was destroyed. The surrounding CAM showed a few angiogenesis formation. However, in the control group, a number of angiogenesis were observed. CONCLUSION: S. nigrum could inhibit the angiogenesis on CAM.",M2

Results showed that in the CAM assay MMEC induced an angiogenic response comparable to that of a well-known angiogenic cytokine, namely fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), while RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of endostatin mRNA detected in MM treated CAM was significantly lower respect to control CAM.

18467105,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents.Direct and indirect involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in tumor growth and metastasis makes them ideal targets for anticancer therapy. A paradigm shift from inhibition of single RTK to inhibition of multiple RTKs has been recently demonstrated. We designed and synthesized eight N(4)-phenylsubstituted-6-(2-phenylethylsubstituted)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamines as homologated series of our previously published RTK inhibitors. We reasoned that increased flexibility of the side chain, which determines potency and selectivity, would improve the spectrum of RTK inhibition. These compounds were synthesized using a bis-electrophilic cyclization to afford substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines followed by chlorination and substitution at the 4-position with various anilines. Five additional compounds of this series were previously reported by Gangjee et al.(1) with activities against IGFR only. Their synthesis, characterization and biological activities against a variety of other RTKs are reported in this study for the first time. The biological evaluation, in whole cell assays, showed several analogs had remarkable inhibitory activity against epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta), the growth of A431 cells in culture, and in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) angiogenesis assay. The inhibitory data against the RTKs in this study demonstrate that variation of the 6-ethylaryl substituents as well as the N(4)-phenyl substituents of these analogs does indeed control both the potency and specificity of inhibitory activity against RTKs. In addition, homologation of the chain length of the 6-substituent from a methylene to an ethyl increases the spectrum of RTK inhibition. New multi-RTK inhibitors (8, 12) and potent inhibitors of angiogenesis (15, 19) were identified with the best compound, N(4)-(3-trifluromethylphenyl)-6-(2-phenylethyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (15), with an IC(50) value of 30nM in the CAM angiogenesis inhibition assay.",M2
18465955,"Short-term and long-term effects of optical clearing agents on blood vessels in chick chorioallantoic membrane.The tissue optical clearing technique shows great potential in optical diagnosis and therapy. However, short-term and long-term effects of optical clearing agents on blood vessels, which are relevant to the safety of clinical applications, have not been clarified. We used laser speckle contrast imaging to monitor the changes in blood vessels in chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) after application of glycerol or glucose. The changes in morphology of vessels and blood flow velocity were measured. Long-term effects on blood vessels were investigated by observing the function and the development of blood vessels. The results show that glycerol reduces the local blood flow velocity and constricts and even blocks vessels quickly. At 2 days, the blood flow velocity is recovered to different extents, and new blood vessels develop but are fewer in number. Glucose induces slow changes in blood flow or vessels. However, most blood vessels are blocked, and no new blood vessel develops at 2 days. The effects depend on the dosage of agents, including volume and concentration, and decrease with the dosage of agents. Therefore, short-term effects of glucose on blood vessels are slighter than those of glycerol, but long-term effects of glucose are greater.",M2
18458436,"Assessment of angiogenic properties of biomaterials using the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay.The angiogenic potential of a biomaterial is a critical factor for successful graft intake in tissue engineering. We developed a modified, rapid and reproducible chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay to evaluate the ability of biomaterials in inducing blood vessel density. Five biomaterials including one-layer porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), two-layer SIS, four-layer vacuum pressed (VP) SIS, polyglycolic acid (PGA) and PGA modified with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were analyzed. A circular section (1.2 mm diameter) of each biomaterial was placed near a group of blood vessels in the CAM. Blood vessels around the biomaterials were captured with black and white images at 96 h post implantation; and the images were subjected to densitometry evaluation. One-layer SIS induced a significant increase in blood vessel density as compared to the cellulose nitrate negative control, and had the greatest increase in blood vessel density as compared to four-layer VP SIS, PGA, or PLGA modified PGA. Although two-layer SIS has enhanced physical structure for surgical manipulation, its induction in blood vessel density was significantly lower than the one-layer SIS. Stripping the SIS proteins or incubating one-layer SIS with neutralizing antibodies against basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) resulted in decreased angiogenesis. Consistent with results obtained from bladder augmentation animal models, these results confirmed that angiogenic growth factors were present in SIS and affected the angiogenic potential of biomaterials. These data also demonstrated that the CAM assay can be used to ascertain methodically the angiogenic potential of biomaterials.",M2
18425365,"Clodronate inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.The effects of amino-bisphosphonate clodronate on endothelial cell functions involved in angiogenesis, namely proliferation and morphogenesis on matrigel were tested in vitro, whereas its effects on angiogenesis were studied in vivo. This was performed by using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. In vitro, clodronate inhibited the endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion, peaking at 30 microM. At the same concentration, clodronate inhibited the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2)-induced capillary-like tube formation in the morphogenesis assay on matrigel. In vivo, when tested with the CAM assay, clodronate again displayed the capability to inhibit FGF-2-induced angiogenesis. Overall, these results suggest that antiangiogenesis by clodronate can be used to treat a wide spectrum of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including certain chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer.",M2
18404792,"Nitric oxide and the collagenous protein biosynthesis of irradiated chick chorioallantoic membrane.PURPOSE: To study the effect of irradiation doses (2 Gy and 5 Gy) on the rate of collagenous protein biosynthesis (CPB) of chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) and to investigate the possible role of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), its inactive enantiomer D-NAME and the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in this effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The originally established CAM angiogenesis model was used with few modifications described earlier. The CAM areas were irradiated on the 10th or the 14th day of embryo development with a single dose of 2 or 5 Gy and the CPB was determined 6 h later. L-NAME, D-NAME and SNP were added to the CAM after the irradiation. RESULTS: The experiments didn't show any significant differences in almost all of the treatment courses. In the 10-day CAM preparations the irradiation not significantly (NS) inhibited the CAM CPB, whereas L-NAME abolished this effect only in the case of 2 Gy dose (NS). The addition of SNP or D-NAME in the post-irradiated 10-day CAM exerted radiosensitization that was significant only in the case of the combination of D-NAME with the 5 Gy dose. There was no significant effect on the respective treatments of the 14-day CAM. The CPB of the 14-day CAM was significantly lower with regard to the values of the 10-day CAM. CONCLUSION: The biochemical evaluation of the CAM (CPB method) seems to be not suitable for radiobiological studies. Nevertheless, the implication of NO in the X-ray induced antiangiogenicity cannot be excluded.",M2
18399434,"The use of HET-<e>CAM</e> test in detecting the ocular irritation.Agrochemicals must undergo numerous toxicological tests before registration. One of these experiments is the examination of eye irritation potential. To get knowledge about eye irritation, recently only the in vivo Draize-test is accepted, which is one of the most criticized methods because of the injuries inflicted on the test animals. Several in vitro methods have been used to investigate the toxicity of potential eye irritants with a view to replacing in vivo eye irritation testing. In the HET-CAM test chemicals are placed in direct contact with chorioallantoic membrane of the hen's egg. The occurrence of vascular injury or coagulation in response to a compound is the basis for employing this technique as an indication of the likelihood that a chemical would damage mucous membranes (especially the eye) in vivo. In our studies comparative screening was performed with a set of agrochemicals to establish paralell data on in vitro (HET-CAM) and in vivo (Draize) results in case of 6 agrochemicals. The solutions to be tested are added to the membrane and left in contact for 5 minutes and the membrane is examined for vascular damage at set time periods. Irritancy is scored according to the severity and speed at which damage occurs providing an indication of the likely irritant effect of the compound. Our study showed good correlation between results obtained by the HET-CAM test and those of the Draize rabbit eye test most cases. The present form of the HET-CAM test can be proposed as a pre-screen method of eye irritation tests.",M2
18396639,"[Inhibitory effect of oxaliplatin in combination with hyperthermia on angiogenesis]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of oxaliplatin in combination with hyperthermia on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: MTT method was used to observe the influence of oxaliplatin on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or human colon cancer cells (LOVO). The influence of oxaliplatin on HUVEC migration was evaluated by Transwell. Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model was used to check whether the neovascularization of CAM could be suppressed in vivo. RESULTS: The survival rate of HUVEC was 80.1% - 42.5% within a range of 0.5 - 16 microg/ml and was negatively correlated with the concentration (correlation coefficient was - 0. 943, P = 0.005). The survival rate of LOVO cells within those doses was more than that of HUVEC. There was a synergistic antiangiogenic effect when a combination of oxaliplatin (0.5 microg/ml, 1 microg/ml and 16 microg/ml) with hyperthermia was used while additional effect was shown by the combinatioin of oxaliplatin (2 microg/ml, 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml) and hyperthermia in vitro. Oxaliplatin inhibited migration of HUVEC in vitro at low doses (0.25 - 2 microg/ml), and also suppressed angiogenesis of CAM in vivo at doses of 1 -4 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: The results of this experiment showed that low dose of oxaliplatin has anti-angiogenic effect in vitro, while in combination with hyperthermia has additional effect both in vivo and in vitro.",M2
18326748,"Selective inhibition of angiogenesis in small blood vessels and decrease in vessel diameter throughout the vascular tree by triamcinolone acetonide.PURPOSE: To quantify the effects of the steroid triamcinolone acetonide (TA) on branching morphology within the angiogenic microvascular tree of the chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) of quail embryos. METHODS: Increasing concentrations of TA (0-16 ng/mL) were applied topically on embryonic day (E) 7 to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of quail embryos cultured in petri dishes and incubated for an additional 24 or 48 hours until fixation. Binary (black/white) microscopic images of arterial end points were quantified by generational analysis of vessel branching (VESGEN) software to obtain major vascular parameters that include vessel diameter (D(v)), fractal dimension (D(f)), tortuosity (T(v)), and densities of vessel area, length, number, and branch point (A(v), L(v), N(v), and Br(v)). For assessment of specific changes in vascular morphology induced by TA, the VESGEN software automatically segmented the vascular tree into branching generations (G(1)... G(10)) according to changes in vessel diameter and branching. RESULTS: Vessel density decreased significantly up to 34% as the function of increasing concentration of TA according to A(v), L(v), Br(v), N(v), and D(f). TA selectively inhibited the growth of new, small vessels because L(v) decreased from 13.14 +/- 0.61 cm/cm(2) for controls to 8.012 +/- 0.82 cm/cm(2) at 16 ng TA/mL in smaller branching generations (G(7)-G(10)) and for N(v) from 473.83 +/- 29.85 cm(-2) to 302.32 +/- 33.09 cm(-2). In contrast, vessel diameter (D(v)) decreased throughout the vascular tree (G(1)-G(10)). CONCLUSIONS: By VESGEN analysis, TA selectively inhibited the angiogenesis of smaller blood vessels, but decreased the vessel diameter of all vessels within the vascular tree.",M2
18304881,"Taspine isolated from Radix et Rhizoma Leonticis inhibits proliferation and migration of endothelial cells as well as chicken chorioallantoic membrane neovascularisation.The aim of the present study was to investigate an anti-angiogenic effect of taspine isolated from Radix et Rhizoma Leonticsi. Taspine was screened for the first time, using cell membrane chromatography (CMC). The anti-angiogeneic activity of taspine was tested by using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) neovascularisation model in vivo and the HUVEC proliferation and migration models in vitro, respectively. The results showed that taspine could inhibit CAM angiogenesis significantly within the concentration range of 0.5-2 mug/egg, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. The CAM histomorphology results indicated that taspine could inhibit blood vessels sprouts and proliferation of vascular endothelial cell. These findings suggest that taspine is a promising candidate for use as an angiogenesis inhibitor.",M2
18291379,"Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) model: a useful tool to study short-term transplantation of cryopreserved human ovarian tissue.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model for the study of short-term transplantation of frozen human ovarian tissue. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Academic research unit. PATIENT(S): Ovarian tissue was obtained from three women. INTERVENTION(S): Frozen-thawed human cortical fragments were grafted onto traumatized CAM or beneath the CAM of 10-day-old chick embryos. Grafts were retrieved after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days in ovo. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S): Viability was assessed by calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer I. Tissue integrity, ischemic injury, and neovascularization were evaluated by histology. Cell proliferation was analyzed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): All the grafts showed adhesion when placed onto CAM, compared with only 30.4% beneath the CAM. Follicles were healthy, apart from a few degenerated follicles in necrotic and fibrotic areas. After 5 days, the majority of follicles were intermediate (32%) or primary (45.7%). Ki-67 immunohistochemistry revealed 12.5% proliferative follicles on day 2, reaching 20.7% on day 5. Fibrosis appeared on day 1; necrosis, follicular degeneration and follicular proliferation on day 2; and neovascularization and stromal cell proliferation on day 3. CONCLUSION(S): The present study showed that the CAM model provides a new approach to study human ovarian tissue transplantation in its first ischemic stages, yielding information on the timing of tissue changes before the establishment of neovascularization.",M2
18228425,"The chick chorioallantoic membrane as an in vivo angiogenesis model.The chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay for angiogenic activity is a model originally developed to study the angiogenic activity of tumor samples.

18380472,"Multivalency of Sonic hedgehog conjugated to linear polymer chains modulates protein potency.A potently active multivalent form of the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) was produced by bioconjugation of a modified recombinant form of Shh to the linear polymers poly(acrylic acid) (pAAc) and hyaluronic acid (HyA) via a two-step reaction exploiting carboimiide and maleimide chemistry. Efficiency of the conjugation was approximately 75% even at stoichiometric ratios of 30 Shh molecules per linear HyA chain (i.e., 30:1 Shh/HyA). Bioactivity of the conjugates was tested via a cellular assay across a range of stoichiometric ratios of Shh molecules to HyA linear chains, which was varied from 0.6:1 Shh/HyA to 22:1 Shh/HyA. Results indicate that low conjugation ratios decrease Shh bioactivity and high ratios increase this activity beyond the potency of monomeric Shh, with approximately equal activity between monomeric soluble Shh and conjugated Shh at 7:1 Shh/HyA. In addition, high-ratio constructs increased angiogenesis determined by the in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) assay. These results are captured by a kinetic model of multiple interactions between the Shh/HyA conjugates and cell surface receptors resulting in higher cell signaling at lower bulk Shh concentrations.",M2
18354337,"Predicting clinical efficacy of photoangiolytic and cutting/ablating lasers using the chick chorioallantoic membrane model: implications for endoscopic voice surgery.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The optimal balance between a laser's clinical efficacy and collateral thermal damage is the major determinant for selection of a particular laser in endolaryngeal surgery. The chick chorioallantoic membrane (<e>CAM</e>) simulates the microvasculature of the human vocal fold and is, therefore, useful for testing effects of laser settings, mode of delivery, active cooling, and wavelength. Such information is essential for optimizing the effectiveness of lasers in treating laryngeal pathology while preserving vocal function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The thermal and coagulative effects of four lasers (585 nm PDL, 532 nm KTP, 2.01ìm Thulium, 10.6ìm CO2) were quantified at selected (and clinically relevant) energy settings before and after tissue cooling using the CAM model. Measures included imaging real-time vascular reactions in the CAM model (i.e., vessel coagulation and/or rupture), and post-procedure histologic analysis of CAM tissue. In each experiment, laser energy was applied to the CAM in a controlled manner. Cooling was done using a dermatological cold-air device, and temperatures were measured with a thermistor. Lasers tested included the photoangiolytic pulsed-dye (PDL) and KTP, as well as the ablative/cutting CO2 and thulium lasers. The vessel rupture/coagulation and thermal effects of various energy-delivery parameters on the CAM, with and without cooling, were assessed. After removal of the CAM, specimens were stained as whole-mounts, photographed at 4X magnification, and evaluated by two independent, blinded surgeon reviewers. The efficacy of increased pulse-width (KTP laser) on treating larger vessels (&gt;0.5 mm) and the effects of extravasated blood on photoangiolysis were also evaluated. RESULTS: Photoangiolytic lasers: Vessel coagulation/rupture rates showed that the PDL caused more frequent vessel rupture than the KTP laser. For both lasers, cooling the CAM by approximately 20 degrees C resulted in 30% - 60% reduction in the thermal-damage zone (P &lt; .05). Cooling reduced the efficacy of coagulation with the PDL but not with the KTP laser. The clinically observed phenomenon that laser heating of extravasated blood increases thermal damage and decreases efficacy of coagulation was clearly evident in the CAM model. Ablative lasers: The thermal-damage zone of the CO2 laser (0.3 mm spot size) was not significantly different with or without cooling (0.32 mm2 and 0.34 mm2, respectively) (P = .30). However, when the spot size was defocused to 1 mm, the thermal-damage zone was over 2x greater when the tissue was not cooled (0.74 mm2 vs 0.35 mm2) (P &lt; .002). The thermal-damage zone of the Thulium laser was reduced by an average of 58% for the three power settings tested when the CAM was air-cooled (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAM was an excellent model for studying the effects of photoangiolytic lasers, for which optimal pulse-widths exist for vessel coagulation. Smaller vessels coagulated reliably at pulse widths &gt;15 msec, and larger vessels required pulse widths &gt;35 msec for optimal coagulation. Cooling the target tissue decreased the thermal-damage zone created by photoangiolytic lasers. While cooling had no effect on the efficacy of coagulation with longer pulse widths (KTP), tissue cooling decreased the coagulation rate at shorter pulse widths (PDL). The thermal effects of cutting/ablating lasers can be reduced with cooling, but the CAM was not a good model with which to study coagulation/rupture rates in cutting/ablating lasers.",M2
