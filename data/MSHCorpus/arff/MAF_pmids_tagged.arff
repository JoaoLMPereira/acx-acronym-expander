19031451,"Immunotherapy of HIV-infected patients with Gc protein-derived macrophage activating factor (GcMAF).Serum Gc protein (known as vitamin D3-binding protein) is the precursor for the principal macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). The MAF precursor activity of serum Gc protein of HIV-infected patients was lost or reduced because Gc protein is deglycosylated by alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from HIV-infected cells. Therefore, macrophages of HIV-infected patients having deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be activated, leading to immunosuppression. Since Nagalase is the intrinsic component of the envelope protein gp120, serum Nagalase activity is the sum of enzyme activities carried by both HIV virions and envelope proteins. These Nagalase carriers were already complexed with anti-HIV immunoglobulin G (IgG) but retained Nagalase activity that is required for infectivity. Stepwise treatment of purified Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generated the most potent macrophage activating factor (termed GcMAF), which produces no side effects in humans. Macrophages activated by administration of 100 ng GcMAF develop a large amount of Fc-receptors as well as an enormous variation of receptors that recognize IgG-bound and unbound HIV virions. Since latently HIV-infected cells are unstable and constantly release HIV virions, the activated macrophages rapidly intercept the released HIV virions to prevent reinfection resulting in exhaustion of infected cells. After less than 18 weekly administrations of 100 ng GcMAF for nonanemic patients, they exhibited low serum Nagalase activities equivalent to healthy controls, indicating eradication of HIV-infection, which was also confirmed by no infectious center formation by provirus inducing agent-treated patient PBMCs. No recurrence occurred and their healthy CD + cell counts were maintained for 7 years.",M1
18329161,"Modulation of protein stability by O-glycosylation in a designed Gc-<e>MAF</e> analog.The post-translational modification of proteins by the covalent attachment of carbohydrates to specific side chains, or glycosylation, is emerging as a crucial process in modulating the function of proteins. In particular, the dynamic processing of the oligosaccharide can correlate with a change in function. For example, a potent macrophage-activating factor, Gc-MAF, is obtained from serum vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) by stepwise processing of the oligosaccharide attached to Thr 420 to the core alpha-GalNAc moiety. In previous work we designed a miniprotein analog of Gc-MAF, MM1, by grafting the glycosylated loop of Gc-MAF on a stable scaffold. GalNAc-MM1 showed native-like activity on macrophages (Bogani 2006, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128 7142-43). Here, we present data on the thermodynamic stability and conformational dynamics of the mono- and diglycosylated forms. We observed an unusual trend: each glycosylation event destabilized the protein by about 1 kcal/mol. This effect is matched by an increase in the mobility of the glycosylated forms, as evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. An analysis of the solvent-accessible surface area shows that glycosylation causes the three-helix bundle to adopt conformations in which the hydrophobic residues are more solvent exposed. The number of hydrophobic contacts is also affected. These two factors, which are ultimately explained with a change in occupancy for conformers of specific side chains, may contribute to the observed destabilization.",M1
18058096,"Immunotherapy of metastatic colorectal cancer with vitamin D-binding protein-derived macrophage-activating factor, GcMAF.Serum vitamin D binding protein (Gc protein) is the precursor for the principal macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). The MAF precursor activity of serum Gc protein of colorectal cancer patients was lost or reduced because Gc protein is deglycosylated by serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancerous cells. Deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be converted to MAF, leading to immunosuppression. Stepwise treatment of purified Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generated the most potent macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) ever discovered, but it produces no side effect in humans. Macrophages treated with GcMAF (100 microg/ml) develop an enormous variation of receptors and are highly tumoricidal to a variety of cancers indiscriminately. Administration of 100 nanogram (ng)/ human maximally activates systemic macrophages that can kill cancerous cells. Since the half-life of the activated macrophages is approximately 6 days, 100 ng GcMAF was administered weekly to eight nonanemic colorectal cancer patients who had previously received tumor-resection but still carried significant amounts of metastatic tumor cells. As GcMAF therapy progressed, the MAF precursor activities of all patients increased and conversely their serum Nagalase activities decreased. Since serum Nagalase is proportional to tumor burden, serum Nagalase activity was used as a prognostic index for time course analysis of GcMAF therapy. After 32-50 weekly administrations of 100 ng GcMAF, all colorectal cancer patients exhibited healthy control levels of the serum Nagalase activity, indicating eradication of metastatic tumor cells. During 7 years after the completion of GcMAF therapy, their serum Nagalase activity did not increase, indicating no recurrence of cancer, which was also supported by the annual CT scans of these patients.",M1
17935130,"Immunotherapy of metastatic breast cancer patients with vitamin D-binding protein-derived macrophage activating factor (GcMAF).Serum vitamin D3-binding protein (Gc protein) is the precursor for the principal macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). The MAF precursor activity of serum Gc protein of breast cancer patients was lost or reduced because Gc protein was deglycosylated by serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancerous cells. Patient serum Nagalase activity is proportional to tumor burden. The deglycosylated Gc protein cannot be converted to MAF, resulting in no macrophage activation and immunosuppression. Stepwise incubation of purified Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generated probably the most potent macrophage activating factor (termed GcMAF) ever discovered, which produces no adverse effect in humans. Macrophages treated in vitro with GcMAF (100 pg/ml) are highly tumoricidal to mammary adenocarcinomas. Efficacy of GcMAF for treatment of metastatic breast cancer was investigated with 16 nonanemic patients who received weekly administration of GcMAF (100 ng). As GcMAF therapy progresses, the MAF precursor activity of patient Gc protein increased with a concomitant decrease in serum Nagalase. Because of proportionality of serum Nagalase activity to tumor burden, the time course progress of GcMAF therapy was assessed by serum Nagalase activity as a prognostic index. These patients had the initial Nagalase activities ranging from 2.32 to 6.28 nmole/min/mg protein. After about 16-22 administrations (approximately 3.5-5 months) of GcMAF, these patients had insignificantly low serum enzyme levels equivalent to healthy control enzyme levels, ranging from 0.38 to 0.63 nmole/min/mg protein, indicating eradication of the tumors. This therapeutic procedure resulted in no recurrence for more than 4 years.",M1
16768713,"Adjuvant effect of mushroom glucan and bovine lactoferrin upon Aeromonas hydrophila vaccination in catla, Catla catla (Hamilton).Mushroom glucan and bovine lactoferrin (Lf), known for their immunostimulatory potential, were used as adjuvant in conjunction with a formalin-killed Aeromonas hydrophila vaccine in catla, Catla catla. In vitro antigen-specific responsiveness of catla leucocytes and protective responses against experimental challenge with homologous antigen were monitored following immunization. Antigen-specific proliferation, 'macrophage activating factor' (<e>MAF</e>) production and antibody production were significantly higher in fish injected with glucan adjuvanted vaccine. Lf adjuvanted preparations showed a weak proliferative response and MAF production, although the antibody production was significantly higher than the controls. A good degree of protection was achieved with the glucan adjuvanted vaccine. However, in spite of producing significant anti-A. hydrophila antibody, Lf adjuvanted vaccine did not confer any protection following challenge with A. hydrophila. The potential of adjuvanticity of mushroom glucan and bovine Lf in intraperitoneal vaccination is discussed.",M1
16734450,"A designed glycoprotein analogue of Gc-<e>MAF</e> exhibits native-like phagocytic activity.Rational protein design has been successfully used to create mimics of natural proteins that retain native activity. In the present work, de novo protein engineering is explored to develop a mini-protein analogue of Gc-MAF, a glycoprotein involved in the immune system activation that has shown anticancer activity in mice. Gc-MAF is derived in vivo from vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) via enzymatic processing of its glycosaccharide to leave a single GalNAc residue located on an exposed loop. We used molecular modeling tools in conjunction with structural analysis to splice the glycosylated loop onto a stable three-helix bundle (alpha3W, PDB entry 1LQ7). The resulting 69-residue model peptide, MM1, has been successfully synthesized by solid-phase synthesis both in the aglycosylated and the glycosylated (GalNAc-MM1) form. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the expected alpha-helical secondary structure. The thermodynamic stability as evaluated from chemical and thermal denaturation is comparable with that of the scaffold protein, alpha3W, indicating that the insertion of the exogenous loop of Gc-MAF did not significantly perturb the overall structure. GalNAc-MM1 retains the macrophage stimulation activity of natural Gc-MAF; in vitro tests show an identical enhancement of Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis in primary macrophages. GalNAc-MM1 provides a framework for the development of mutants with increased activity that could be used in place of Gc-MAF as an immunomodulatory agent in therapy.",M1
16400520,"Inhibition of angiogenesis by vitamin D-binding protein: characterization of anti-endothelial activity of DBP-<e>maf</e>.Angiogenesis is a complex process involving coordinated steps of endothelial cell activation, proliferation, migration, tube formation and capillary sprouting with participation of intracellular signaling pathways. Regulation of angiogenesis carries tremendous potential for cancer therapy. Our earlier studies showed that vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) acts as a potent anti-angiogenic factor and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The goal of this investigation was to understand the effect of DBP-maf on human endothelial cell (HEC) and the mechanism of angiogenesis inhibition. DBP-maf inhibited human endothelial cell (HEC) proliferation by inhibiting DNA synthesis (IC(50) = 7.8 +/- 0.15 microg/ml). DBP-maf significantly induced S- and G0/G1-phase arrest in HEC in 72 h. DBP-maf potently blocked VEGF-induced migration, tube-formation of HEC in a dose dependent manner. In addition, DBP-maf inhibited growth factor-induced microvessel sprouting in rat aortic ring assay. Moreover, DBP-maf inhibited VEGF signaling by decreasing VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and ERK1/2, a downstream target of VEGF signaling cascade. However, Akt activation was not affected. These studies collectively demonstrate that DBP-maf inhibits angiogenesis by blocking critical steps such as HEC proliferation, migration, tube formation and microvessel sprouting. DBP-maf exerts its effect by inhibiting VEGR-2 and ERK1/2 signaling cascades. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of anti-endothelial activity of DBP-maf will allow us to develop it as an angiogenesis targeting novel drug for tumor therapy.",M1
16342171,"Macrophage/microglia activation factor expression is restricted to lesion-associated microglial cells after brain trauma.After traumatic brain lesion, microglial cells are rapidly activated, migrate toward the sites of injury, and cause secondary damage that accounts for most of the loss of brain function. In the present study, we have characterized a new macrophage/microglia activation factor (<e>MAF</e>). Using the monocytic cell line U937, we were able to demonstrate that MAF is upregulated after TPA-induced differentiation into macrophages. We have generated a specific antibody against MAF. In BV-2 microglial cells, MAF is partially co-localized with IB4, a classical microglial marker. In addition, we have analyzed the in vivo expression patterns of MAF after entorhinal cortex lesion. We were able to show a substantial upregulation of MAF on selected CD11b(+) and IB4(+) macrophages/microglial cells in the deafferented hippocampus and in the perilesional region, while no MAF expression was detectable on the contralateral side. Confocal microscopy revealed a lysosome-like expression pattern in BV-2 cells, as well as in ECL-associated macrophages/microglial cells in vivo. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that U937 cells with downregulated MAF converted slower and to a significantly reduced extent to the macrophageal phenotype after TPA treatment. In addition, MAF downregulation in BV-2 microglial cells substantially reduced the phagocytotic uptake of dextran beads. Our data indicate that MAF is expressed in selected macrophages/microglial cells around the lesion and in the degenerating hippocampus after ECL. Furthermore, MAF expression in monocytic cells seems to play a functional role in the differentiation to a phagocytosing phenotype and may be, at least partially, required for phagocytotic activity, specifically in lesioned tissue after brain trauma.",M1
16337134,"Possible implication of macrophages in the regulation of cytochrome P450 activities in carp (Cyprinus carpio).Macrophages play a key role in the regulation of cytochrome P450 activity induced by immunostimulants in mammals. We investigated the effects of immunostimulants (LPS, dextran sulfate and tilorone) on biotransformation and macrophage activities in carp. The major effect of LPS was its capacity to inhibit 3-MC-induced cytochrome P450 activities in the liver and head kidney. Basal phase I activities were reduced by tilorone and dextran sulfate in immune organs. Tilorone and dextran sulfate differently modulated total cytochrome P450 contents and P4501A activities suggesting differential sensitivity for P450 classes. In immune organs, tilorone and dextran sulfate inhibited basal EROD activity. Tilorone inhibited 3-MC-induced EROD activity whereas dextran sulfate enhanced this activity. LPS and dextran sulfate increased ROS production by macrophages and all the immunostimulants induced macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) production. This study demonstrates for the first time in fish the capacity of CYP-regulated immunostimulants to activate macrophages and provides initial insight into the capacity of macrophages to regulate CYP activity induced by immunostimulants in fish.",M1

15543617,"Characterization of oncogene dysregulation in multiple myeloma by combined FISH and DNA microarray analyses.Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus and various partner loci frequently are associated with multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated the expression profiles of the FGFR3/MMSET, CCND1, CCND3, <e>MAF</e>, and MAFB genes, which are involved in t(4;14)(p16.3;q32), t(11;14)(q13;q32), t(6;14)(p21;q32), t(14;16)(q32;q23), and t(14;20)(q32;q12), respectively, in purified plasma cell populations from 39 MMs and six plasma cell leukemias (PCL) by DNA microarray analysis and compared the results with the presence of translocations as assessed by dual-color FISH or RT-PCR. A t(4;14) was found in 6 MMs, t(11;14) in 9 MMs and 1 PCL, t(6;14) in 1 MM, t(14;16) in 2 MMs and 1 PCL, and t(14;20) in 1 PCL. In all cases, the translocations were associated with the spiked expression of target genes. Furthermore, gene expression profiling enabled the identification of putative translocations causing dysregulation of CCND1 (1 MM and 1 PCL) and MAFB (1 MM and 1 PCL) without any apparent involvement of immunoglobulin loci. Notably, all of the translocations were mutually exclusive. Markedly increased MMSET expression was found in 1 MM showing associated FGFR3 and MMSET signals on an unidentified chromosome. Our data suggest the importance of using combined molecular cytogenetic and gene expression approaches to detect genetic aberrations in MM.",M1
15313514,"Mercury chloride effects on the function and cellular integrity of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) head kidney macrophages.The objective of this work was to study mercury chloride effects on the function and integrity of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) head kidney macrophages (S-HKM), and to evaluate the response of HgCl2-exposed cells to macrophage activating factor(s) (<e>MAF</e>) produced by sea bass head kidney leukocytes. There was considerable variability in the effects of HgCl2 on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by S-HKM. When incubated with HgCl2, cells from five out of nine fish tested showed a decrease in ROS production as compared to cells incubated with medium alone. In those cultures, MAF addition prevented the mercury chloride-induced decrease in ROS production. In other S-HKM cultures isolated from different fish, mercury chloride abrogated the up-regulating effect of MAF on the respiratory burst. MAF activation of the phagocytic activity of S-HKM was also impaired by HgCl2 addition. Mercury chloride induced apoptosis in S-HKM cultures and MAF addition prevented this effect.",M1
15123313,"Modulation of the activity of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) head-kidney macrophages by macrophage activating factor(s) and lipopolysaccharide.The aim of this study was to establish the requirements for macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) production by sea bass head-kidney leucocytes and the kinetics of macrophage activation when exposed to MAF-containing supernatants and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known macrophage stimulant. MAF activity was found in culture supernatants of total head-kidney leucocytes pulsed with 5 microg ml(-1)Con A, 5 or 10 ng ml(-1)PMA and 100 ng ml(-1)calcium ionophore, or 10 microg ml(-1)Con A alone, as assessed by the capacity to prime macrophages for enhanced production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). Mixed leucocyte cultures from two or eight fish showed higher MAF activity after stimulation, indicating that a mixed leucocyte reaction was also important for MAF production. MAF-induced activation of macrophage cultures was highest at 18 h of exposure and was lost by 72 h except for MAF induced by Con A-stimulation alone. LPS primed macrophages for increased ROI production at early incubation times and down-regulated ROI production after 24 h. LPS had no effect in further stimulating the MAF-induced priming effect on production of ROI and down-regulated the MAF-priming by 48 h. Sea bass head-kidney macrophages did not show increased nitrite production when exposed to MAF and/or LPS, which may be related to their differentiation status.",M1
15084979,"Pancreatic carcinogenesis: apoptosis and angiogenesis.Apoptosis and angiogenesis are critical biologic processes that are altered during carcinogenesis. Both apoptosis and angiogenesis may play an important role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Despite numerous advances in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, its prognosis remains dismal and a new therapeutic approach is much needed. Recent research has revealed that apoptosis and angiogenesis are closely interrelated. Several reports show that a tumor suppresser gene that is expressed in pancreatic carcinoma and related to malignant potential can induce apoptosis and also inhibit angiogenesis. At present, it is generally accepted that tumor growth in cancers, including pancreatic cancer, depends on angiogenesis. We have identified 2 new angiogenesis inhibitors from a conditioned medium of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line (BxPC-3): antiangiogenic antithrombin III (aaAT-III) and vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>maf</e>). These molecules were able to regress tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, demonstrating potent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover, the angiogenesis inhibitors induced tumor dormancy in the animal model. These results suggest that antiangiogenic therapy using angiogenesis inhibitors may become a new strategy for treatment of pancreatic cancer in the near future.",M1
15063720,"Identification of macrophage/microglia activation factor (<e>MAF</e>) associated with late endosomes/lysosomes in microglial cells.Damage to the central nervous system triggers rapid activation and specific migration of glial cells towards the lesion site. There, glial cells contribute heavily to secondary neuronal changes that take place after lesion. In an attempt to identify the molecular cues of glial activation following brain trauma we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screenings from lesioned and control hippocampus. Here we report on the identification of the macrophage/microglia activation factor (MAF), a new membrane protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Expression analysis revealed that MAF is predominantly expressed in microglial cells in the brain, and is upregulated following brain lesion. Overexpression of MAF in non-glial cells shows an intracellular codistribution with the lysosomal marker endosome/lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1). Furthermore, MAF-transfected cells show that MAF is primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and that this association can be disrupted by activation of protein kinase C-dependent pathways. In conclusion, these results imply that MAF is involved in the dynamics of lysosomal membranes associated with microglial activation following brain lesion.",M1
14696974,"The anabolic effects of vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>MAF</e>) and a novel small peptide on bone.Vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) has previously been shown to stimulate bone resorption and correct the skeletal defects associated with osteopetrosis in two nonallelic mutations in rats. This same protein and a small fragment of the protein have now been shown to demonstrate an anabolic effect on the skeleton of both newborn and young adult, intact rats. The novel peptide fragment was synthetically produced based on the human amino acid sequence at the site of glycosylation in the third domain of the native protein (DBP). The peptide tested is 14 amino acids in length and demonstrates no homologies other than to that region of DBP. Newborn rats were injected i.p. with saline, peptide (0.4 ng/g body wt.) or DBP-MAF (2 ng/g body wt.) every other day from birth to 14 days of age. On day 16 the rats were euthanized and the long bones collected for bone densitometry by pQCT. After 2 weeks of treatment with either the whole protein (DBP-MAF) or the small peptide, bone density was significantly increased in the treated animals compared to the saline controls. Young adult female rats (180 grams) were given s.c. injections of saline or peptide (0.4 ng/g body wt. or 5 ng/g body wt.) every other day for 2 weeks; 2 days after the final injections, the rats were euthanized and the femurs and tibias collected for bone densitometry. Both doses of the peptide resulted in significant increases in bone density as determined by pQCT. Young adult rats were injected locally with a single dose of the peptide (1 microg) or saline into the marrow cavity of the distal femur. One week after the single injection, the bones were collected for radiographic and histological evaluation. The saline controls showed no evidence of new bone formation, whereas the peptide-treated animals demonstrated osteoinduction in the marrow cavity and osteogenesis of surrounding cortical and metaphyseal bone. These data suggest that DBP-MAF and the synthetic peptide represent therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of a number of bone diseases and skeletal disorders. Systemic administration could be used to treat osteoporosis and a number of other osteopenias, and local administration could be effective in fractures, bony defect repairs, spinal surgery, and joint replacement.",M1
12938159,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mediates DBP-<e>maf</e>-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages.Vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage-activating factor (DBP-maf) is derived from serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP) by selective deglycosylation during inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of DBP-maf on RAW 264.7 macrophages and the underlying intracellular signal transduction pathways. DBP-maf increased proapoptotic caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities and induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. However, DBP, the precursor to DBP-maf did not induce apoptosis in these cells. Cell cycle analysis of DBP-maf-treated RAW 264.7 cells revealed growth arrest with accumulation of cells in sub-G(0)/G(1) phase. We also investigated the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the DBP-maf-induced apoptosis of RAW264.7 cells. DBP-maf increased the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1/2, while it decreased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, attenuated DBP-maf-induced apoptosis. PD98059, a MEK specific inhibitor, did not show a significant inhibition of apoptosis induced by DBP-maf. Taken together, these results suggest that the p38 MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in DBP-maf-mediated apoptosis of macrophages. Our studies indicate that, during inflammation DBP-maf may function positively by causing death of the macrophages when activated macrophages are no longer needed at the site of inflammation. In summary, we report for the first time that DBP-maf induces apoptosis in macrophages via p38 and JNK1/2 pathway.",M1
12659668,"Vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>maf</e>) inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice.We have isolated a selectively deglycosylated form of vitamin D binding protein (DBP-maf) generated from systemically available DBP by a human pancreatic cancer cell line. DBP-maf is antiproliferative for endothelial cells and antiangiogenic in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. DBP-maf administered daily was able to potently inhibit the growth of human pancreatic cancer in immune compromised mice (T/C=0.09). At higher doses, DBP-maf caused tumor regression. Histological examination revealed that treated tumors had a higher number of infiltrating macrophages as well as reduced microvessel density, and increased levels of apoptosis relative to untreated tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that DBP-maf is an antiangiogenic molecule that can act directly on endothelium as well as stimulate macrophages to attack both the endothelial and tumor cell compartment of a growing malignancy.",M1
12485583,"Lindane increases macrophage-activating factor production and intracellular calcium in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) leukocytes.The authors studied the in vitro effects of lindane on macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) production by peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) in rainbow trout. MAF production by PBLs induced normally by mitogens concanavalin A (ConA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was not modified by a pretreatment with lindane (from 2.5 to 50 microM). Only a concentration of 100 microM lindane decreased MAF production, associated with cellular death. Moreover, MAF activities were detected in supernatants of PBL cultures treated with lindane from 2.5 to 10 microM in absence of ConA/PMA stimulation. Factors present in these supernatants remain to be identified. Lindane, at concentrations which did not induce MAF production (50 and 100 microM) led to an increase in PBL calcium levels by acting on the endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores. Although the intracytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase seems to be associated with cell death, lindane-induced MAF production may be linked with other intracellular mechanisms.",M1
11775791,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus alters turbot Scophthalmus maximus macrophage nitric oxide production.The effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in vitro infection on the nitric oxide (NO) production by turbot Scophthalmus maximus kidney macrophages has been addressed in the past. Previously, we had determined that only a small fraction of turbot possess head kidney macrophages that respond to a single exposure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with NO production (LPS-responsive macrophages), whereas macrophage cultures from other individuals were not activated by LPS alone and needed a combination of stimuli to respond (LPS-non-responsive macrophages). In the current work, we examined the effect of VHSV on NO production by macrophages characterized as LPS-responsive macrophages or LPS-non-responsive macrophages. Combinations of LPS and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) were also used to stimulate the cells for NO production. The effect of VHSV on NO production depends on the response to LPS alone. When a low multiplicity of infection was used (1.78 x 10(-3)), the NO production in response to LPS in LPS-responsive macrophages was significantly decreased. However, LPS-non-responsive macrophage cultures produced NO when a combination of LPS and VHSV was used. In the case of a higher VHSV multiplicity of infection (1.78), no significant change was observed in LPS-non-responsive animals. Combinations of LPS with TNF-alpha, LPS with MAF, and TNF-alpha with MAF were used to induce NO production in LPS-non-responsive macrophages. In all these cases, VHSV suppressed NO production, although at a significant level only when a combination of TNF-alpha and MAF was used for the induction of NO.",M1
11755697,"Lindane-induced macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) production by peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): involvement of intracellular cAMP mobilization.We studied the in vitro effects of the insecticide lindane (2.5-50 microM) on macrophage activating factor (MAF) production by the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) in rainbow trout. The MAF production induced by the mitogens concanavalin A (ConA) and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was not modified by lindane pre-treatment. But lindane alone (2.5-25 microM) stimulated the secretion of MAF by PBLs. Intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) was measured over 6 min by spectrofluorimetry using Indo-1/AM as fluorescent probe. Lindane (25-100 microM) significantly increased the [Ca2+]i in PBLs, but had no effect on calcium at the dose that caused MAF secretion. Moreover, the effect of lindane on MAF production was potentiated by the inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, isobutylmethylxanthin (IBMX). Lindane also directly increased adenosine monophosphate cyclic (cAMP) in PBLs over the same concentration range that it stimulated MAF production by PBLs. Taken together, these results suggest that lindane increase MAF production by acting on intracellular cAMP concentrations. Moreover, the capacity of this insecticide to act on the [Ca2+]i or on the intracellular concentrations of cAMP according to the dose used could possibly explain its contradictory effects earlier observed on immunity.",M1
11426659,"Phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages after conagenin injection to rats.Phagocytic functions of rat alveolar macrophages (AM) following intraperitoneal injection of conagenin (CNG) and of AM sub-populations fractionated by Percoll discontinuous gradient centrifugation were investigated. Phagocytosis of opsonized-sheep red blood cells (SRBC) following in vitro incubation with CNG showed a significant increase in a higher density of AM (fraction IV). In addition, phagocytosis was also increased in lower density ones (fractions I and II) by macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) co-cultivation. CNG-injected rats for 5 consecutive days showed a dose-dependent increase in phagocytosis of AM compared to the control rats. Although the distribution of AM sub-population in rats injected CNG was not significantly different compared to the control rats, phagocytosis was significantly increased in AM of a lower density fraction (fraction II). These results suggest that CNG directly increases phagocytosis of AM in a higher density fraction, and indirectly enhances phagocytosis in AM of a lower density fraction via increasing MAF-like material production.",M1
11255236,"Baculovirus-expressed vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>maf</e>) activates osteoclasts and binding of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) does not influence this activity.Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is a multi-functional serum protein that is converted to vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-maf) by post-translational modification. DBP-maf is a new cytokine that mediates bone resorption by activating osteoclasts, which are responsible for resorption of bone. Defective osteoclast activation leads to disorders like osteopetrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of bone mass. Previous studies demonstrated that two nonallelic mutations in the rat with osteopetrosis have independent defects in the cascade involved in the conversion of DBP to DBP-maf. The skeletal defects associated with osteopetrosis are corrected in these mutants with in vivo DBP-maf treatment. This study evaluates the effects of various forms of DBP-maf (native, recombinant, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) bound) on osteoclast function in vitro in order to determine some of the structural requirements of this protein that relate to bone resorbing activities. Osteoclast activity was determined by evaluating pit formation using osteoclasts, isolated from the long bones of newborn rats, incubated on calcium phosphate coated, thin film, Ostologic MultiTest Slides. Incubation of osteoclasts with ex vivo generated native DBP-maf resulted in a dose dependent, statistically significant, activation of the osteoclasts. The activation was similar whether or not the vitamin D binding site of the DBP-maf was occupied. The level of activity in response to DBP-maf was greater than that elicited by optimal doses of other known stimulators (PTH and 1,25(OH(2)D(3)) of osteoclast function. Furthermore, another potent macrophage activating factor, interferon--gamma, had no effect on osteoclast activity. The activated form of a full length recombinant DBP, expressed in E. coli showed no activity in the in vitro assay. Contrary to this finding, baculovirus-expressed recombinant DBP-maf demonstrated significant osteoclast activating activity. The normal conversion of DBP to DBP-maf requires the selective removal of galactose and sialic acid from the third domain of the protein. Hence, the differential effects of the two recombinant forms of DBP-maf is most likely related to glycosylation; E. coli expressed recombinant DBP is non-glycosylated, whereas the baculovirus expressed form is glycosylated. These data support the essential role of glycosylation for the osteoclast activating property of DBP-maf.",M1
10831796,"Requirements for nitric oxide production by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) head kidney macrophages.The effect of different cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) macrophage nitric oxide (NO) production has been studied. We have found two different responses concerning NO production in response to LPS. We have studied 43 turbot and only macrophage cultures derived from 30.2% of these turbot were significantly stimulated by LPS. The macrophage populations that did not respond to LPS, showed a constitutive production that was significantly reversed by NO inhibitors like N(G)-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), and was dependent on intracellular calcium concentration. We studied the effect of other stimuli combined with LPS on the NO production of these otherwise non-responsive macrophages. LPS combined with turbot macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) containing supernatants, was capable of significantly stimulating some of these macrophage populations. The same response was observed when LPS was combined with turbot IFN-alphabeta-like substances. When LPS was combined with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (hrTNF-alpha), the NO production was significantly induced in all macrophage populations studied.",M1
10831790,"Serum amyloid A transcription in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) hepatocytes is enhanced by stimulation with macrophage factors, recombinant human IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.Serum amyloid A (A-SAA) has previously been reported to be an acute-phase protein in salmonids. Hepatocytes represent a major source of A-SAA in salmonids, but nothing is known about hepatocyte SAA synthesis in fish. In the present work, the expression of A-SAA transcripts in primary cultures of Atlantic salmon hepatocytes in response to macrophage derived cytokines, human recombinant cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied by Northern blot analysis. The macrophage supernatants were prepared by stimulating Atlantic salmon head kidney macrophages with LPS, yeast glucan or a leukocyte derived macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). The supernatants from glucan- or MAF-stimulated macrophages had no effect on A-SAA expression of the hepatocytes, while supernatants from LPS-stimulated macrophages gave about a 2-fold increase in expression. The combination of either glucan and MAF, or LPS and MAF were more effective and these supernatants gave a 3.4- and 5.2-fold increase in A-SAA expression, respectively. The hepatocytes were also treated with the human recombinant cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, alone or in combination. The A-SAA response to each of them alone was modest, but TNFalpha and IL-6 or IL-1beta and IL-6 in combination gave a higher response than each cytokine alone. These data suggest that the expression of A-SAA by hepatocytes from Atlantic salmon is induced by cytokine-like molecules. Interestingly, hepatocytes treated directly with LPS gave a more than 10-fold increase in SAA mRNA expression, but it is not known if this is a direct effect of LPS on the hepatocytes or if it is mediated by other contaminating cell types.",M1

10470679,"Conagenin derived from Streptomyces roseosporus enhances macrophage functions.In contrast to the studies that describes the effects of conagenin (CNG) on the cellular immunity of lymphocytes (references), we investigated the in vitro effect of CNG on macrophage function. Phagocytosis of alveolar macrophages (AM) against opsonized-sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was significantly enhanced following in vitro incubation with CNG for 12 hours at 37 degrees C, which was closely associated with increased expression of Fc-receptor in AM membranes. Macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), prepared from splenic lymphocytes in vitro stimulated with concanavarin A (Con A) for 48 hours at 37 degrees C, had also the enhancing effect on phagocytosis of AM against opsonized-SRBC. Preincubation with CNG (0.1 microg/ml) and MAF (1/100 dilution) induced the additional effect on phagocytosis of AM, which was associated with the increased expression of Fc-receptor in AM membranes. These results suggest that CNG enhances AM phagocytosis by increasing the expression of Fc-receptor on their membranes via either effecting different sub-populations of AM cells or by activating independent mechanism on the same AM cell population.",M1
10456382,"The toothless osteopetrotic rat has a normal vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>MAF</e>) cascade and chondrodysplasia resistant to treatments with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and/or DBP-MAF.The osteopetrotic rat mutation toothless (tl) is characterized by little or no bone resorption, few osteoclasts and macrophages, and chondrodysplasia at the growth plates. Short-term treatment of tl rats with colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) has been shown to increase the number of osteoclasts and macrophages, producing dramatic resolution of skeletal sclerosis at some, but not all, sites. Defects in production of vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) have been identified in two other independent osteopetrotic mutations of the rat (op and ia), and two in the mouse (op and mi), in which macrophages and osteoclasts can be activated by the administration of exogenous DBP-MAF. The present studies were undertaken to examine the histology and residual growth defects in tl rats following longer CSF-1 treatments, to investigate the possibility that exogenous DBP-MAF might act synergistically with CSF-1 to improve the tl phenotype, and to assess the integrity of the endogenous DBP-MAF pathway in this mutation. CSF-1 treatment-with or without DBP-MAF-induced resorption of metaphyseal bone to the growth plate on the marrow side, improved slightly but did not normalize long bone growth, and caused no improvement in the abnormal histology of the growth plate. Injections of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-Pc) to prime macrophage activation via the DBP-MAF pathway raised superoxide production to similar levels in peritoneal macrophages from both normal and mutant animals, indicating no defect in the DBP-MAF pathway in tl rats. Interestingly, pretreatments with CSF-1 alone also increased superoxide production, although the mechanism for this remains unknown. In summary, we find that, unlike other osteopetrotic mutations investigated to date, the DBP-MAF pathway does not appear to be defective in the tl rat; that additional DBP-MAF does not augment the beneficial skeletal effects seen with CSF-1 alone; and that the growth plate chondrodystrophy seen in this mutation is unaffected by either molecule. Thus, the tl mutation intercepts the function of a gene required for both normal endochondral ossification and bone resorption, thereby uncoupling the coordination of skeletal metabolism required for normal long bone growth.",M1

9893164,"Antitumor effect of vitamin D-binding protein-derived macrophage activating factor on Ehrlich ascites tumor-bearing mice.Cancerous cells secrete alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NaGalase) into the blood stream, resulting in deglycosylation of serum vitamin D3-binding protein (known as Gc protein), which is a precursor for macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). Incubation of Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generates the most potent macrophage activating factor (designated GcMAF). Administration of GcMAF to cancer-bearing hosts can bypass the inactivated MAF precursor and act directly on macrophages for efficient activation. Therapeutic effects of GcMAF on Ehrlich ascites tumor-bearing mice were assessed by survival time and serum NaGalase activity, because serum NaGalase activity was proportional to tumor burden. A single administration of GcMAF (100 pg/mouse) to eight mice on the same day after transplantation of the tumor (5 x 10(5) cells) showed a mean survival time of 21 +/- 3 days for seven mice, with one mouse surviving more than 60 days, whereas tumor-bearing controls had a mean survival time of 13 +/- 2 days. Six of the eight mice that received two GcMAF administrations, at Day 0 and Day 4 after transplantation, survived up to 31 +/- 4 days whereas, the remaining two mice survived for more than 60 days. Further, six of the eight mice that received three GcMAF administrations with 4-day intervals showed an extended survival of at least 60 days, and serum NaGalase levels were as low as those of control mice throughout the survival period. The cure with subthreshold GcMAF-treatments (administered once or twice) of tumor-bearing mice appeared to be a consequence of sustained macrophage activation by inflammation resulting from the macrophage-mediated tumoricidal process. Therefore, a protracted macrophage activation induced by a few administrations of minute amounts of GcMAF eradicated the murine ascites tumor.",M1
9731194,"A possible new role for vitamin D-binding protein in osteoclast control: inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ sensing at low physiological concentrations.Upon removal of its sialic acid or galactose residue, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) becomes a potent macrophage-activating factor, DBP-<e>MAF</e>. Here we document a new function of DBP-MAF and its parent molecule, DBP, in osteoclast control. We show that all DBPs potently inhibit extracellular Ca2+ (cation) sensing at low nanomolar concentrations with the following rank order of potency: native DBP = sialidase-treated DBP &gt; beta-galactosidase-treated DBP. This attenuation remains unaffected despite co-incubation either with the native DBP ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or with an asialoglycoprotein receptor modulator, asialoorosomucoid. Taken together, the results suggest that circulating DBP may play a role in the systemic control of osteoclastic bone resorption, a hitherto unrecognized action of the protein.",M1
9644113,"Effects of oxysterols upon macrophage and lymphocyte functions in vitro.Oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol (oxysterols), found in high concentrations in atherosclerotic lesions, are potent immunosuppressive agents inhibiting T-cell responses to different stimuli. The action of oxysterols on macrophage functions and macrophage-lymphocyte interaction has been poorly investigated. In this work, the effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHCh) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-KCh) upon some functions of murine peritoneal macrophage (PM), such as generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), secretion of neopterin and interleukin-1 (IL-1)-like activity, Fc-receptor (FcR) activity, and murine and human lymphocyte functions, participating in lymphocyte-macrophage interactions, such as macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) and Ia-inducing factor (IaIF) secretion, were studied in vitro. 7-KCh in concentration of 5 micrograms/mL culture medium only, but not 25-OHCh, significantly inhibited ROI generation by zymosan-stimulated PM. Pretreatment of PM for 22 h with 25-OHCh and 7-KCh led to the decrease of IL-1-like activity secretion. 25-OHCh and 7-KCh inhibited both FcR-dependent binding and phagocytosis of sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Oxysterols did not change both spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of neopterin by PM. 25-OHCh dose-dependently and more efficiently than 7-KCh inhibited murine splenocyte secretion of MAF, which activity was determined by the ability of splenocyte-conditioned medium to stimulate ROI generation in PM. Both 25-OHCh and 7-KCh inhibited significantly proliferative activity of human mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), as well as lymphocyte secretion of IaIF, which stimulates the expression of HLA antigens in cultured human monocytes. Purified Ch did not alter these parameters. These data showed, that some inflammatory functions of macrophages and lymphocytes may be modified by such environmental conditions as the presence of oxysterols.",M1
9187119,"Immunotherapy of BALB/c mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor with vitamin D-binding protein-derived macrophage activating factor.Vitamin D3-binding protein (DBP; human DBP is known as Gc protein) is the precursor of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). Treatment of mouse DBP with immobilized beta-galactosidase or treatment of human Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generated a remarkably potent MAF, termed DBPMAF or GcMAF, respectively. The domain of Gc protein responsible for macrophage activation was cloned and enzymatically converted to the cloned MAF, designated CdMAF. In Ehrlich ascites tumor-bearing mice, tumor-specific serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NaGalase) activity increased linearly with time as the transplanted tumor cells grew in the peritoneal cavity. Therapeutic effects of DBPMAF, GcMAF, and CdMAF on mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor were assessed by survival time, the total tumor cell count in the peritoneal cavity, and serum NaGalase activity. Mice that received a single administration of DBPMAF or GcMAF (100 pg/mouse) on the same day after transplantation of tumor (1 x 10(5) cells) showed a mean survival time of 35 +/- 4 days, whereas tumor-bearing controls had a mean survival time of 16 +/- 2 days. When mice received the second DBPMAF or GcMAF administration at day 4, they survived more than 50 days. Mice that received two DBPMAF administrations, at days 4 and 8 after transplantation of 1 x 10(5) tumor cells, survived up to 32 +/- 4 days. At day 4 posttransplantation, the total tumor cell count in the peritoneal cavity was approximately 5 x 10(5) cells. Mice that received two DBPMAF administrations, at days 0 and 4 after transplantation of 5 x 10(5) tumor cells, also survived up to 32 +/- 4 days, while control mice that received the 5 x 10(5) ascites tumor cells only survived for 14 +/- 2 days. Four DBPMAF, GcMAF, or CdMAF administrations to mice transplanted with 5 x 10(5) Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with 4-day intervals showed an extended survival of at least 90 days and an insignificantly low serum NaGalase level between days 30 and 90.",M1
9040985,"Deactivation of primed respiratory burst response of goldfish macrophages by leukocyte-derived macrophage activating factor(s).Macrophage activation factors (<e>MAF</e>), induced maximal priming of the respiratory burst response in GMCL after 6 h of stimulus, but by 24 or 48 h no priming effect was observed. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also primed the respiratory burst of goldfish macrophages, but the kinetics of priming were different from that induced by MAF. LPS induced a gradual increase in priming potential over 48 h of cultivation. Co-stimulation of macrophages with MAF and LPS resulted in enhanced priming of respiratory burst activity compared to either factor alone; however, the kinetics of priming were similar to those induced by MAF only. The MAF antagonized the ability of LPS to prime the respiratory burst over extended cultivation. The priming kinetics of the respiratory burst induced by MAF and/or LPS were not unique to GMCL, but were also similar for primary cultures of IVDKM. Respiratory burst deactivated macrophages-mounted potent nitric oxide response, indicating that this deactivation event was selective for respiratory burst activity. Autocrine factors produced by MAF-activated macrophages augmented priming of the respiratory burst, suggesting that deactivation of primed respiratory burst responses was not due to cytokine mediators produced by activated macrophages, but was most likely an intracellular deactivation event. Furthermore, production of reactive intermediates by activated fish macrophages was biphasic; with maximal ROI production occurring 6 h after stimulus, and maximal RNI occurring 72 h after stimulus. Our results indicate that activated fish macrophages mount sequential antimicrobial responses that are selectively deprogrammed once maximal induction has occurred. The ability to selectively deactivate ROI production without affecting subsequent RNI production may play an important role in host defense: regulating the duration of ROI production, and thus minimizing host tissue damage in an otherwise futile attempt to eliminate ROI resistant pathogens.",M1
8874186,"The effects of vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor and colony-stimulating factor-1 on hematopoietic cells in normal and osteopetrotic rats.Osteopetrosis is a heterogeneous group of bone disorders characterized by the failure of osteoclasts to resorb bone and by several immunological defects including macrophage dysfunction. Two compounds, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and vitamin D-binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>MAF</e>) were used in the present study to evaluate their effects on the peritoneal population of cells and on cells within the bone marrow microenvironment in normal and incisors absent (ia) osteopetrotic rats. Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that administration of DBP-MAF to newborn ia animals results in a substantial increase in bone marrow cavity size due to upregulated osteoclast function. To study the effects of these compounds on the macrophage/osteoclast precursors, DBP-MAF, CSF-1, and the combination of these compounds were given to newborn ia and normal littermate animals. Both the normal and mutant phenotypes responded similarly when treated with these compounds. Rats exhibited a profound shift toward the macrophage lineage from the neutrophil lineage when compared with vehicle-treated control animals after treatment with these compounds. In the in vivo peritoneal lavage study, animals received injections of CSF-1, DBP-MAF or DBP-MAF/CSF-1 over a 4-week period. The various types of cells in the peritoneal cavity were then enumerated. The in vitro study consisted of cells isolated from the bone marrow microenvironment and cultured on feeder layers of CSF-1, DBP-MAF, or DBP-MAF/CSF-1 for colony enumeration. The increase in macrophage numbers at the expense of neutrophil numbers could be seen in both the in vivo and in vitro experiments. The macrophage/osteoclast and neutrophil lineages have a common precursor, the granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming cell (GM-CFC). With the addition of CSF-1, the GM-CFC precursor may be induced into the macrophage/osteoclast lineage rather than the granulocyte lineage. This increased pool of cells in the macrophage/osteoclast lineage can be functionally upregulated with the subsequent addition of DBP-MAF to perform the activities of phagocytosis and bone resorption. The in vitro data also showed that DBP-MAF did not support colony development as in CSF-1 or the combination treatment. The recruitment and activation of cells into the macrophage/ osteoclast lineage may help to correct the bone and immune defects found in diseases demonstrating a significant lack of myeloid cells, as well as neutrophilia disorders and the disease, osteopetrosis.",M1

The production of MAF, quantitated by the induction of NO in a retrovirus transformed macrophage cell line, HD11 (Beug et al., 1979, Cell 18, 375) was antigen-specific and correlated well with T cell proliferation. Further studies showed that production of MAF was abrogated by cyclosporin A, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies. These data suggested that production of MAF required T cell activation and can be used as measure of antigen and mitogen-specific T cell responses in chickens.",M1
8955595,"In vitro studies on the regulation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) macrophage respiratory burst activity.Modulation of the respiratory burst activity of head kidney macrophages isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was observed following treatment with several biologically active substances. Macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) induced the highest increment if respiratory burst activity relative to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or beta-glucans from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Increased responses were more evident when these molecules were combined in pairs. Negative regulation of respiratory burst activity was observed when diMePGE2 was added to the macrophages, with maximal inhibition seen using a concentration of 2.6 microM. Inhibition was also seen using stimulated macrophages, either by co-incubation of stimuli and diMePGE2 or by adding diMePGE2 to previously stimulated cells. The inhibitory effect on macrophages was detectable with 3 h of incubation with diMePGE2 and by 24 h the level of the response was even lower than that from unstimulated (control) macrophages. Of significance was the finding that the inhibitory effect of prostaglandin on macrophage function could be overcome by co-incubation with stimulatory molecules or by pre-treatment with MAF and LPS or MAF and TNF alpha Thus, the regulation of macrophage activation in fish is likely to be as complex as in mammals.",M1

In this study, we showed that a related analog, designated S-28828, induced interferon (IFN) and macrophage activating cytokine(s) (macrophage activating factor, <e>MAF</e>) in chickens in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. IFN and MAF were detectable in the serum of chickens following oral administration. Serum IFN levels were the highest at 2 h after treatment. Although there was no detectable IFN in sera of chickens at 8, 24, and 48 h after treatment, high levels of interferon inducible enzyme, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase (2'5'OAS) were present at these time points. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed that spleen cells, bone marrow (BM) cells, and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were capable of producing IFN and MAF, although spleen cells produced the highest levels.

8773198,"Macrophage activating factor(s) secreted by mitogen stimulated goldfish kidney leukocytes synergize with bacterial lipopolysaccharide to induce nitric oxide production in teleost macrophages.Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrated that fish macrophages produce nitric oxide. To elucidate the mechanisms which regulate nitric oxide production in teleosts, we examined whether macrophage activating factors (<e>MAFs</e>) secreted by mitogen stimulated leukocytes, induced nitric oxide production in a long-term cultured macrophage cell line and in primary cultures of kidney macrophages from the goldfish. The results indicate that both primary and long term cultured goldfish macrophages produce nitric oxide in response to MAF or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and co-stimulation with both factors results in a synergistic induction of nitric oxide production. MAF that induced nitric oxide production were present in leukocyte supernatants as early as 24 h after addition of mitogens to cell cultures. The production of MAF was dependent upon the incubation temperature, presence of serum in the culture medium and duration of incubation: maximal MAF activity was detected in 72-96 h supernatants raised in media with serum at 30 degrees C. MAF-induced nitric oxide production by long term cultured macrophages was inhibited by 1000 microM NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or amino-guanidine, indicating an L-arginine-dependent metabolic pathway for the production of the reactive nitrogen intermediates in teleosts. The biochemical events of cytokine induced nitric oxide production by teleost macrophages appear to be similar to those of mammalian macrophages.",M1
8573395,"Structural modification of serum vitamin D3-binding protein and immunosuppression in AIDS patients.A serum glycoprotein, vitamin D3-binding protein (Gc protein), can be converted by beta-galactosidase of stimulated B lymphocytes and sialidase of T lymphocytes to a potent macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), a protein with N-acetylgalactosamine as the remaining sugar moiety. Thus, Gc protein is a precursor for MAF. Treatment of purified Gc protein with immobilized beta-galactosidase and sialidase generates an extremely high-titered MAF (GcMAF). When peripheral blood monocytes/macrophages of 46 HIV-infected patients were treated with GcMAF (100 pg/ml), the monocytes/macrophages of all patients were efficiently activated. However, the MAF precursor activity of plasma Gc protein was low in 16 (35%) of of these patients. Loss of the MAF precursor activity appeared to be due to deglycosylation of plasma Gc protein by alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase found in the patient blood stream. Levels of plasma alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in individual patients had an inverse correlation with the MAF precursor activity of their plasma Gc protein. Thus, precursor activity of Gc protein and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity in patient blood can serve as diagnostic and prognostic indices.",M1

If generated using a 12-h stimulation period, such supernatants were found to elevate significantly the respiratory burst activity of target macrophages; that is, they contained a macrophage-derived MAF (m-MAF), but supernatants generated using a shorter incubation period showed no significant activity. Combinations of these treatments were particularly effective in generating m-MAF-containing supernatants. The elevation of respiratory burst activity by supernatants generated using combined treatments could be partially inhibited by prior treatment of the target macrophages with anti-TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Similarly, treatment of macrophages with combinations of 1-MAF and m-MAF generated supernatants with potent m-MAF activity and this activity was partially inhibited by prior treatment of the target cells with anti-TNFR1 mAb. In addition, the presence of anti-transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) serum while generating these latter supernatants resulted in significantly increased m-MAF activity. Such data suggest that fish leukocytes secrete a variety of potent macrophage-activating (TNF-alpha) and -deactivating (TGF-beta) factors.",M1
7669443,"Effects of vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-<e>MAF</e>) infusion on bone resorption in two osteopetrotic mutations.Osteopetrosis is a heterogeneous group of bone diseases characterized by an excess accumulation of bone and a variety of immune defects. Osteopetrosis (op) and incisors absent (ia) are two nonallelic mutations in the rat which demonstrated these skeletal defects as a result of reduced bone resorption. Osteopetrotic (op) rats have severe sclerosis as a result of reduced numbers of osteoclasts which are structurally abnormal. The sclerosis in ia rats is not as severe as in op mutants; they have elevated numbers of osteoclasts, but they are also morphologically abnormal, lacking a ruffled border. Both of these mutations have defects in the inflammation-primed activation of macrophages. They demonstrate independent defects in the cascade involved in the conversion of vitamin D binding protein (DBP) to a potent macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF). Because this factor may also play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoclastic dysfunction, the effects of ex vivo-generated DBP-MAF were evaluated on the skeletal system of these two mutations. Newborn ia and op rats and normal littermate controls were injected with DBP-MAF or vehicle once every 4 days from birth until 2 weeks of age, at which time bone samples were collected to evaluate a number of skeletal parameters. DBP-MAF treated op rats had an increased number of osteoclasts and the majority of them exhibited normal structure. There was also reduced bone volume in the treated op animals and an associated increased cellularity of the marrow spaces. The skeletal sclerosis was also corrected in the ia rats; the bone marrow cavity size was significantly enlarged and the majority of the osteoclasts appeared normal with extensive ruffled borders.",M1
7535703,"Recombinant chicken interferon: a potent antiviral agent that lacks intrinsic macrophage activating factor activity.Crude preparations of chicken interferon (ChIFN) from various sources contain both antiviral and macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) activity. Previous serological data indicated that unlike mammals, birds might express only a single type of IFN in response to viruses and mitogens that exhibits both activities. We have now expressed a complementary DNA for virus-induced ChIFN in transfected COS cells and in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant ChIFN is a powerful antiviral agent and has high Mx promoter-inducing activity. However, as the sole agent, recombinant ChIFN lacks MAF activity: it does not induce the secretion of nitric oxide in primary monocyte-derived chicken macrophages. A neutralizing antiserum prepared against cloned ChIFN blocks most of the antiviral and Mx promoter-inducing activity present in preparations of natural ChIFN, but does not inhibit the MAF activity. These results demonstrate that chicken cells can be induced to secrete a novel cytokine which probably represents the avian homolog of mammalian IFN-gamma.",M1

Immune IFN was purified 25-fold from Con A conditioned medium using controlled-pore glass column chromatography resulting in an increase in specific antiviral activity from 7 to 3290 units mg-1. Partially purified immune IFN retained antiviral and macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>)-like activities. Normal peripheral blood macrophages, when cultured in the presence of partially purified immune IFN, showed a dose-dependent increase in cell surface major histocompatibility complex Class II antigen expression by flow cytometry. Northern blot analysis of mRNA obtained from IFN-treated macrophages showed a concomitant increase in Class II gene expression. This effect was more obvious in cells induced for 48 h than in those induced for 24 h. These results strongly suggest that existence of an avian homologue of the MAF-like activity.",M1

In vitro treatment of wild-type rat peritoneal cells with lyso-Pc or DDG efficiently activated macrophages whereas treatment of op mutant rat peritoneal cells with lyso-Pc or DDG did not activate macrophages. The inflammation-primed macrophage activation cascade in rats requires participation of B lymphocytes and vitamin D binding protein (DBP). Lyso-Pc-inducible beta-galactosidase of wild-type rat B lymphocytes can convert DBP to the macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), whereas B lymphocytes of the op mutant rats were shown to be deficient in lyso-Pc-inducible beta-galactosidase. DBP is conserved among mammalian species. Treatment of human DBP (Gc1 protein) with commercial glycosidases yields an extremely high titrated MAF as assayed on mouse and rat macrophages. Because the enzymatically generated MAF (GcMAF) bypasses the role of lymphocytes in macrophage activation, the op mutant rat macrophages were efficiently activated by administration of a small quantity (100 pg/rat) of GcMAF.

Cells from fish held at 14 degrees C and stimulated to produce MAF immediately after isolation were capable of secreting MAF down to 6 degrees C (the lowest temperature tested). However, after 48 h at 6 degrees C, these leucocytes show impaired MAF secretion. Acclimation of fish to low temperatures (7 degrees C) did not recover the inhibitory effects of low in vitro temperatures on MAF production, but if these leucocytes were preincubated at 10 or 18 degrees C for 48 h, MAF was produced from these cells. Interestingly, macrophages isolated from fish kept at 7 or 14 degrees C and cultured at low temperatures (6 degrees C) were responsive to MAF-containing supernatants, and showed a higher relative increase in respiratory burst activity compared with their counterparts cultured at 10 and 18 degrees C. Such observations clearly demonstrate that a major impairment of bactericidal activity at low temperatures resides within the specific immune compartment of fish. The implications for fish health are discussed.",M1
8370669,"Identification of human T cell hybridoma-derived macrophage activating factor as interleukin-2.Macrophages are activated by a two-step mechanism involving at least two kinds of factors, a priming and a triggering factor, to become cytotoxic to various tumor cells. In the present study, we purified macrophage-activating factor for cytotoxicity I (<e>MAF</e>-C I), defined as a priming macrophage activating factor (MAF), by about 1,600-fold from the culture supernatant of a human T cell hybridoma, H3-E9-6, by a series of chromatographic procedures. We identified MAF-C I activity released from H3-E9-6 cells as interleukin-2 (IL-2) from the following findings. (i) The physicochemical properties of MAF-C I and IL-2 were almost identical. (ii) Purified MAF-C I active fraction also showed T cell proliferating activity. (iii) MAF-C I activity in the purified fraction was completely neutralized by anti-IL-2 antibodies. (iv) Human recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), at a suboptimal dose, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synergistically induced monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity.",M1
8098027,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor-bearing state: enhanced production of TGF-beta and a progressive increase in TGF-beta susceptibility of anti-tumor CD4+ T cell function.The present study deals with the effect of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on anti-tumor immune responsiveness at various stages of the tumor-bearing state. Spleen cells from BALB/c mice bearing a syngeneic tumor (CSA1M) 1-3 wk after inoculation with CSA1M cells produced interleukin-2 (IL-2) and macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>)/interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) upon in vitro culture without addition of exogenous tumor antigens. This lymphokine production was achieved through collaboration between anti-CSA1M CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells that had been pulsed with CSA1M tumor antigens in vivo in the tumor-bearing state. The IL-2-producing capacity of CD4+ T cells reached the maximal level as early as one week after tumor implantation but decreased with the progress of tumor-bearing stages. In contrast, the capacity of CD4+ T cells to produce MAF/IFN-gamma was not affected but was maintained at high levels even late in the tumor-bearing state. The addition of recombinant TGF-beta (rTGF-beta) to cultures of spleen cells from various tumor-bearing stages resulted in the suppression of lymphokine production. However, the magnitude of the TGF-beta-induced suppression varied depending on which tumor-bearing stages of splenic cells were tested as a responding cell population; it was slight in cells from early (1-3 wk) tumor-bearing stages but increased in cells from donor mice at later tumor-bearing stages. Thus, spleen cells from late tumor-bearing stages with weak but significant IL-2-producing and considerable MAF/IFN-gamma producing capacities failed to produce these lymphokines when rTGF-beta was present in cultures. A progressive increase in the TGF-beta susceptibility was also observed for IL-4-producing Th2 as well as IL-2/MAF-producing Th1 cells. In addition, increased levels of TGF-beta were detected in plasma from tumor-bearing mice at late stages. Taken together, these results indicate that tumor-bearing mice exhibit enhanced production of TGF-beta as well as a progressive increase in the susceptibility of anti-tumor CD4+ T cells to TGF-beta-induced suppressive mechanisms.",M1
1304601,"Enhanced phagocytosis of rat alveolar macrophages by intravenous infusion of an arginine-enriched solution.Phagocytosis of rat alveolar macrophages (AM) was enhanced by the infusion of arginine-rich solution for 7 days. The enhancement of phagocytosis by arginine-rich solution was due to not the difference in the distribution of AM subpopulations (I to IV) but the difference in phagocytic activity of AM in fraction IV. In the process of phagocytosis, there were no significant differences in the stages of migration, attachment, and digestion between control and arginine-rich solutions, although AM from fraction IV of rats infused with arginine-rich solution showed significantly higher ingestion of opsonized sheep red blood cells (SRBC) compared to that of control group. Furthermore, the production of macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) from rat splenocytes was higher in arginine-rich group than that of control group. AM from fraction IV of rats fed a stock diet had a higher arginase activity and showed a significant increase of phagocytosis following in vitro incubation with L-arginine (25 and 50 mM) for 24 h. From these results, the enhanced phagocytosis of AM by arginine-rich solution may be due to the increased phagocytosis of AM from fraction IV, in which the higher sensitivity of AM from fraction IV to arginine and the higher production of MAF from splenocytes following the infusion of arginine-rich solution participate.",M1
1564401,"Pulmonary surfactant phospholipids modulate priming of rabbit alveolar macrophages for oxidative responses.We investigated the effect of individual phospholipids contained in pulmonary surfactant (PS) on the macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>)-induced priming of rabbit alveolar macrophages (AMs) for oxidative responses elicited by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan (Op-Zym). AMs were incubated with MAF with or without phospholipids for 18 h. After incubation, oxidative responses were elicited with PMA (0.5 micrograms/ml) or Op-Zym (250 micrograms/ml) and monitored by chemiluminescence (CL) assays. The data indicate that natural surfactant inhibited MAF-induced priming of rabbit AMs for PMA- or Op-Zym-elicited oxidative responses. Artificial surfactant inhibited PMA-elicited CL responses but enhanced Op-Zym-elicited CL responses. Individual phospholipids differed in modulative activities. Dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) inhibited MAF-induced priming when the oxidative responses were elicited with PMA. Whereas DPPG inhibited Op-Zym-elicited oxidative responses, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DOPC primed AMs for increased Op-Zym-elicited oxidative responses. DOPC did not affect the binding of phorbol dibutyrate to AMs, which suggests that reduced cell binding of phorbol ester was not responsible for the inhibition of PMA-elicited oxidative responses in AMs treated with DOPC. Similarly, DPPC, DOPC, and DPPG did not affect the number of zymosan particles phagocytosed by AMs compared to the control, which suggested that enhanced or reduced Op-Zym-elicited oxidative responses by phospholipids were not due to altered phagocytic activity of AMs. In conclusion, our data indicate that individual surfactant phospholipid differently modulates priming of AMs for oxidative responses, and the effect of individual phospholipids does not account for the effect of complete PS on priming of AMs.",M1
1332156,"Macrophage activation by OM-85 BV.Peritoneal or bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages were exposed for 24 h in vitro to dilutions of the bacterial extract OM-85 BV, in the presence or absence of other added compounds [macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), recombinant murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)]. Various metabolic responses and functional activities were then measured. Glucose oxidation through the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway was markedly stimulated in OM-85 BV-treated macrophages compared to control macrophages. Similarly, OM-85 BV primed macrophages for superoxide production upon triggering by phorbol myristate acetate. Both effects were further enhanced by simultaneous treatment of the cells with MAF with OM-85 BV. The bacterial extract also induced macrophages to release large amounts of nitrite (a marker of the activated state). As regards functional responses, coincubation with MAF and OM-85 BV activated macrophages to destroy target cells as well as intracellular microorganisms; in the latter case, similar results were obtained when MAF was replaced by IFN-gamma. In all these tests, the possibility that the observed effects were due to contamination of the bacterial extracts by endotoxin could be excluded. The above results indicate that OM-85 BV induces metabolic and functional properties in macrophages that are characteristic of the activated state and are important for host defence.",M1
1300982,"Macrophage activating factors produced in the course of murine tularemia: effect on multiplication of microbes.Primary F. tularensis infection in mice induces the production of macrophage activating factors (<e>MAFs</e>) by spleen cells. The stimulation of macrophage cytolytic activity (MAF-c) and hydrogen peroxide production (MAF-H2O2) dominates between days 7 and 10 in the course of tularemia. Three various pools of active fractions (10-11, 14-15, 25-28) were fractionated by two-step chromatography. Typical for 10-11 and 14-15 is MAF-c activity whereas in 25-28 prevails MAF-H2O2. Initial concentrated supernatant (day 7 of infection) and individual fractions have been used to raise antibodies KI (anti 10-11) and KII (anti 14-15). Neutralization reactions with specific antibodies indicate the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in 14-15 (44% inhibitable), interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL 2) in 25-28 (65% and 30% neutralization, respectively). Utilizing KI and KII, 99% and 90% inhibition of cytolytic activity is reached in 10-11 and 14-15, respectively, in spite of non-specific cross reaction. Western blot analysis of proteins in supernatant on day 7 detects, besides TNF alpha, further protein bands (13, 15.5, 52 and 72 kDa) that seem to be associated with macrophage activation. Significant protective effect against in vivo multiplication of tularemic microbes indicates a certain role of TNF alpha, however, cooperation of other molecules is worth to be taken into consideration.",M1
1902819,"A dissociated induction of MCF-producing and <e>MAF</e>-producing T cells specific for Listeria monocytogenes in the in vitro primary culture system.Using an in vitro primary culture system which we had previously established, the induction phase of Listeria monocytogenes-specific effector cells was analysed with respect to their abilities to produce effector lymphokines, macrophage chemotactic factor (MCF) and macrophage-activating factor (MAF). Listeria-specific effector cells generated after in vitro culture of normal spleen cells with viable L. monocytogenes for 5 days conveyed L3T4+, Lyt-2-, Thy-1+ surface antigens and produced MCF and MAF in response to the secondary stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes. The cells required for the induction of Listeria-specific effector cells, which produce effector lymphokines, MCF and MAF, were L3T4+, Lyt-2-, Thy-1+ cells. The kinetic analysis revealed that the ability of these effector cells to produce MCF was generated earlier than that to produce MAF. Furthermore, using passive transfer of cells, the effector cells producing only MCF, which were generated early in culture, conferred delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) alone, but MCF- and MAF-producing effector cells generated late in culture conferred sufficient levels of DTH and acquired cellular resistance (ACR). These results indicate a dissociated production of MCF and MAF by L. monocytogenes-specific T cells generated in the primary in vitro culture system.",M1
1903881,"Activated macrophages in highly irradiated cercariae-induced immunity to Schistosoma japonicum in rats.The results of studies on the schistosomulicidal activity of activated peritoneal and alveolar macrophages (pM phi and aM phi) from rats immunized with highly irradiated (50 krad.) Schistosoma japonicum cercariae are reported. The authors have examined the activation of these macrophages in terms of spreading, adhesion and ingestion of sheep erythrocytes and pinocytosis of horse-radish peroxidase. Using three criteria, peritoneal macrophages and alveolar macrophages from immunized rats and from rats intraperitoneally injected with BCG were significantly more active than those from normal rats or rats stimulated with 10% proteose-peptone or 1% sodium thioglycolate. A significantly higher percentage of adhesion and ingestion was obtained with the sheep erythrocytes that were co-opsonized by heat-inactivated rat anti-sheep erythrocyte serum and fresh normal rat serum. Schistosomulicidal effects were observed with macrophages from irradiated cercariae-immunized rats in two activation systems: in vitro activation in the presence of macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), and in vivo activation by the intraperitoneal challenge with sonicated cercarial antigens.",M1
2127737,"Constitutive production of novel macrophage-activating factor(s) by human T cell hybridomas.Human T cell hybridomas were constructed by somatic cell fusion in order to dissect molecular heterogeneity of human macrophage activating-factors (<e>MAF</e>). Two stable human hybridoma supernatants contained MAF activity capable of inducing human monocytes tumoricidal without the help of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These supernatants in the presence of LPS could also render mouse macrophages tumoricidal. In contrast, recombinant and natural human interferon-gamma (Hu-IFN-gamma) activated human monocytes, but not mouse peritoneal macrophages. The supernatants from the two clones could neither support the growth of human-granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor/human-interleukin-4-dependent (Hu-GM-CSF/Hu-IL-4) cell lines, such as AML 193 and TALL-101, nor stimulate the proliferation of human-interleukin-2-dependent human cell line and lectin-stimulated lymphoblast, which are responsive to human-interleukin-2 and human-interleukin-4. Rabbit or murine antibodies against human-interferon-gamma (Hu-IFN), human-granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, human interleukin-1 alpha, human-interleukin-1 beta, human-interleukin-6, human-tumour necrosis factor (Hu-TNF), human-lymphotoxin and human-macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Hu-MIF) could not absorb MAF activity. MAF activity in the hybridoma supernatants is associated with the two polypeptides of molecular weights of 70,000-80,000 and 20,000-30,000 daltons, as determined by gel filtration. These results indicate decisively that novel MAF molecule(s) is secreted by human T cell hybridomas.",M1
2127486,"Chicken macrophage activation by interferon: do birds lack the molecular homologue of mammalian interferon-gamma?In mammalian species, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a lymphokine with a wide range of biological effects, of which the antiviral and macrophage-activating capacities are those best characterized. In birds, no equivalent with a similar range of actions has as yet been isolated. Chicken splenocytes were stimulated by mitogens in conditions that were similar to those used for the induction of mammalian IFN-gamma. Culture fluids were assayed for antiviral and macrophage-activating capacities. As much as 1000 units/ml of an interferon-like antiviral activity was found in the culture fluid of Staphylococcus aureus lysate-induced spleen cells. Seroneutralization assays with a polyclonal antiserum against purified interferon and physicochemical studies revealed that the antiviral activity is identical to or closely related to type I interferon (interferon-alpha/beta). The presence of macrophage activating factors (<e>MAF</e>) in the splenocyte medium was demonstrated by measuring increased production of H2O2 by chicken peritoneal macrophage cultures and a chicken macrophage cell line (HD11). The heat stability of this MAF activity was similar to that of the antiviral factor, and was completely neutralized by the anti-IFN-alpha/beta antiserum. These results show that when the classical procedure used for the production of mammalian IFN-gamma is applied to chicken splenocytes, it does not yield an equivalent for IFN-gamma/MAF. This suggests that the classification of interferons into types (alpha, beta and gamma), while generally applicable in mammals, may not be applicable in birds.",M1
2223036,"Quartz-induced production of reactive oxygen metabolites by activated human monocyte-derived macrophages.Quartz but not titanium dioxide (TiO2) induced the production of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) by human monocyte-derived macrophages, as measured by lucigenin dependent chemiluminescence. Activation of the macrophages with BCG, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) caused a prominent increase of quartz-induced ROM production, MAF having the strongest effect. The activation did not affect the TiO2 responses to the same extent. Assuming that ROM have a role in the pathogenesis of silica-induced disease in man, we suggest that enhancement of quartz-induced production of ROM by activated pulmonary macrophages may at least partly explain the experimental and epidemiological data indicating that activation of the immune system during infection promotes the development of silicosis.",M1
2126049,"In vitro augmentation of macrophage-activating-factor release from peripheral blood cells of cancer patients by a DNA fraction from Mycobacterium bovis BCG.Effect of a DNA-rich fraction from Mycobacterium bovis BCG (MY-1) on the macrophage-activating-factor (<e>MAF</e>)-activity release from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with benign diseases and patients with gastric cancer or colorectal cancer was studied in vitro. The MAF activity was augmented by the addition of 10 micrograms/ml of MY-1 in many cases. Augmentation of the MAF activity in benign disease, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in stages I to III was observed in five of six cases, eight of 10 cases and five of eight cases, respectively. The activity of MY-1-induced MAF was partially abolished by the treatment with monoclonal anti-interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) antibody. These results suggest that MY-1 augments MAF-activity release from PBL by inducing IFN-gamma and other MAF-like substances.",M1
2150351,"[Regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression in murine peritoneal macrophages]The expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA in murine inflammatory peritoneal macrophages (M phi) was studied with a sensitive liquid hybridization method. Upon exposure to 10-1000 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), M phi were induced to express TNF-alpha mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA was detectable within 1 h after stimulation, peaked at about 2 h and then gradually declined. A 10 min treatment with LPS was enough to stimulate the maximal level of TNF-alpha mRNA, as determined in a 2 h period. Although calcium ionophore A23187 and macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) (both can activate M phi to mediate tumoricidal activity) did not induce TNF-alpha mRNA expression by themselves, they did act synergistically with LPS. Treatment of M phi with retinoic acid strongly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression, whereas trifluoperazine had an opposite effect. Cycloheximide not only synergized with LPS but also induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression by itself. In contrast, actinomycin D completely blocked LPS-induced TNF-alpha gene activation. These findings indicate that LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression is not solely due to an increase in intracellular free calcium ion and is independent of the protein kinase C pathway of signal transduction. In addition, TNF gene activity may be regulated by short-lived protein repressor(s).",M1
2178666,"Anti-tumour efficacy of mouse spleen cells separated with Dolichos biflorus lectin (DBA) in experimental pulmonary metastasis of B16 melanoma cells.Anti-tumour effector cells were generated through 4 days culture of normal C57BL/6 splenocytes in a medium containing concanavalin A supernatant and then fractionated with Dolichos biflorus lectin (DBA) into DBA+ (agglutinable with DBA) and DBA- (non-agglutinable with DBA) cells. The DBA- cells, infused intravenously into mice together with B16 melanoma cells, or adoptively transferred into mice 3 days after the injection of B16 cells, caused a marked decrease in the number of lung nodules, while the DBA+ cells exerted no effect. On the other hand, the DBA+ cells exhibited higher cytolytic activity in vitro than the DBA- cells in short-term 51Cr-release assays. Then, we analysed the mechanism of the strong anti-tumour activity of DBA- cells in vivo. We found that DBA- cells showed higher response to recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) than DBA+ cells and proliferated very well with a small amount of IL-2. In addition, DBA- cells adhered more strongly to lung endothelial cells than DBA+ cells in response to rIL-1 or rTNF. Furthermore, DBA- cells produced larger amounts of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) including IFN-gamma when cultured with B16 melanoma. Taken together, our results show that DBA- cells are effective in reducing experimental pulmonary metastases not only by the direct lytic activity but also by the indirect killing activity through the activated macrophage.",M1
2186941,"Cellular requirements for lymphokine secretion by rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri leucocytes.The ability of different populations of rainbow trout blood leucocytes to produce <e>MAF</e> following stimulation with Con A/PMA was assessed by the amount of NBT reduction in target macrophages. The effect of varying lymphocyte or macrophage number on MAF production in the presence of a constant number of macrophages or lymphocytes respectively, showed that in both cases MAF activity initially increased with increasing cell number and then plateaued. Macrophages alone did not produce MAF whereas some MAF activity was produced by macrophage-depleted lymphocytes, although significantly lower than in the presence of macrophages. Separation of leucocytes into sIg- and sIg+ cells by panning showed that only sIg- lymphocytes could produce MAF and that macrophages were necessary as accessory cells. These results support the contention that fish lymphocytes can be divided into sIg- T cells and sIg+ B cells.",M1
2687379,"Identification of a unique T cell-derived lymphokine that primes macrophages for tumor cytotoxicity.Macrophage activation factor (<e>MAF</e>) activity, assessed by the ability to activate macrophages (MO) to lyse RBL--a TNF-resistant, retrovirally transformed, tumor target--was detected in the PHA-stimulated supernatant (Sup) of LBRM, a murine T cell line. LBRM Sup provided a priming signal to MO, but required the subsequent addition of small amounts of LPS for the expression of tumor cytotoxicity. The identity of the lymphokine responsible for this MAF activity was investigated. IFN-gamma, the only previously characterized lymphokine capable of priming MO for tumor cytotoxicity, did have MAF activity in the assay, but IFN-gamma could not be detected by ELISA in LBRM Sup, and LBRM-derived mRNA lacked detectable message for IFN-gamma. Moreover, anti-IFN-gamma failed to inhibit the MAF activity of LBRM Sup, suggesting that the presence of small, undetectable amounts of IFN-gamma were neither responsible nor required for LBRM MAF activity. LBRM MAF activity appeared distinct from the other previously identified lymphokines produced by LBRM, since granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, IL-2, and IL-3 purified from LBRM Sup were unable to activate MO to lyse RBL. IL-4 and TNF, two lymphokines not known to be produced by LBRM but able to activate MO for cytotoxicity of some tumor targets, were also unable to activate MO for RBL cytotoxicity. LBRM MAF lacked antiviral activity in biologic assays, further distinguishing the lymphokine from IFN-gamma, and had an apparent Mr of 30,000 Da using gel filtration chromatography. Thus, the LBRM T cell line produces a previously undescribed lymphokine that primes MO for tumor cytotoxicity.",M1
2698918,"Effects of vitamin E deficiency on the functions of splenic lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages.This study has been done to determine the effect of vitamin E deficiency on the functions of splenic lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages (AM) in rats. Vitamin E deficiency did not cause any changes of body weight, spleen and thymus weights, and numbers of splenocytes and AM compared with those of control rats. And also, we could not find any significant changes of lymphocyte responses to mitogens (PHA, Con A, and LPS) and natural killer cell (NK) activity except for AM function in vitamin E-deficient rats. In vitamin E-deficient rats, AM showed a higher phagocytosis than that of control rats. After in vitro treatment with a macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) for 4 h at 37 degrees C, AM from control rats showed a greater enhancement (167%) of phagocytic activity compared with that of AM from vitamin E-deficient rats. When the effect of MAF prepared from splenic lymphocytes of rats from control or vitamin E-deficient rats on phagocytosis of AM was studied, MAF from control rats showed an about 150% increase of phagocytic activity in a 1/250 dilution of MAF. However, MAF from vitamin E-deficient group had almost no effect on phagocytosis of AM in the same dilution of MAF as control rats. These results may suggest that vitamin E deficiency induces the higher phagocytic function of AM responsible for host defense in the lung, but their enhancement is not due to the activation by MAF from lymphocytes.",M1
2503386,"Macrophage activation by interferon-gamma from host-protective T cells is inhibited by interleukin (IL)3 and IL4 produced by disease-promoting T cells in leishmaniasis.BALB/c mice are highly susceptible to Leishmania major infection. They develop a progressive fatal disseminating disease even with a minimum infecting dose. However, these mice are able to contain the disease if they are exposed to sublethal gamma-irradiation shortly before infection. Earlier studies demonstrated that CD4+ T cells from mice which had recovered from infection (Tr) can adoptively transfer resistance. In contrast, CD4+ cells from mice with progressive disease (Ts) not only failed to protect, but can reverse the protective effect of the Tr cells. Spleen cells from BALB/c mice which had recovered from L. major infection or which had progressive disease were cultured with leishmanial antigens in vitro. The culture supernatant from spleen cells of recovered mice (TrSN) contains high levels of macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) activity which can activate peritoneal macrophages to kill 51Cr-labeled P815 cells and to eliminate intracellular parasites as measured by the reduction in [3H]thymidine uptake by residual parasites released from macrophages following sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. The MAF activity of TrSN parallels that of recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, culture supernatant of spleen cells from mice with progressive disease (TsSN) contains no detectable MAF but it is able to neutralize the MAF activity of TrSN. The MAF-inhibiting function of TsSN appears to be mediated by interleukin (IL)3 and IL4, since the MAF activity of TrSN and rIFN-gamma also can be inhibited by the addition of rIL3 and rIL4 but not by rIL1 or rIL2. Furthermore, the MAF-inhibiting activity of TsSN can be partially reversed by the addition of specific anti-IL3 or anti-IL4, but completely reversed by the combination of the two antibodies in vitro. These findings provide a mechanism for the immune regulation in leishmaniasis and a means by which the two subsets of CD4+ T cells influence each other through their modulation of macrophage function.",M1
2676851,"Differences in the induction of macrophage cytotoxicity by the specific T lymphocyte factor, specific macrophage arming factor (SMAF), and the lymphokine, macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>).Specific T cell factors, such as specific macrophage arming factor (SMAF), are involved in the initiation of the immune response. Induction of SMAF-producing T lymphocytes in vivo and of SMAF production by T lymphocytes in vitro is dependent on the presence of intact tumor cells, and is independent of antigen presentation by macrophages. SMAF renders peritoneal macrophages cytotoxic for tumor cells. The armed peritoneal macrophages expressed a specific cytotoxicity. However, antigen-presenting cells can trigger lymphokine-producing T lymphocytes. These T lymphocytes produce lymphokines (e.g. macrophage activating factor (MAF] that activate macrophages. The MAF-activated macrophages express a non-specific tumoricidal activity. In the present study, we investigated the difference in the induction of macrophage cytotoxicity by SMAF and MAF. The following differences were found: 1) SMAF renders peritoneal resident macrophages cytotoxic, whereas MAF could only render peritoneal exudate macrophages cytotoxic. 2) SMAF requires only a 4-h incubation with macrophages, whereas MAF activates macrophages optimally after 12 h. 3) SMAF-armed macrophages recognize only the specific target cell(s), and thus, the cytotoxicity is specific in its expression. MAF activated macrophages were non-specifically cytotoxic. 4) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the culture medium did not enhance the cytotoxicity of SMAF-armed macrophages. In contrast, MAF induced tumoricidal activity was enhanced by adding LPS to the culture medium. 5) After adsorption chromatography with anti-murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the arming capacity of SMAF supernatant was not reduced, whereas the activating capacity of the MAF supernatant was significantly reduced or abrogated. After immunization of mice with allogeneic tumor cells, SMAF-producing lymphocytes were detected in the draining lymph nodes already 4 days after immunization and up to 12 days. Lymphocytes with the capacity to produce MAF were present in the draining lymph nodes 14-24 days after immunization. Our data indicate that the T cell factors SMAF and MAF can both render macrophages cytotoxic, but act in a different way and during different stages of the cellular immune response against allogeneic tumor cells.",M1
2669732,"Lead inhibits oxidative metabolism of macrophages exposed to macrophage-activating factor.The present experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of lead on the capacity of macrophages to respond to activating signals by increased respiratory-burst activity. When mouse peritoneal macrophages were exposed for 24 h to macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in the presence of lead acetate, a marked inhibition of their oxidative metabolism was observed. The hexosemonophosphate-shunt (HMPS) activity and the release of oxygen derivatives upon triggering by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were impaired. Treatment with the metal for 1 h led, however, to stimulation rather than inhibition of the PMA-triggered superoxide production, suggesting that the metal interfered with neither the triggering steps nor the activity of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the lead-induced inhibition of macrophage oxidative metabolism did not result from blockade of enzymes of the HMPS pathway. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in macrophage extracts, as well as CO2 production from glucose, remained unaffected by the presence of lead, and extracts of lead-treated macrophages were as active as extracts from control cells in those two assays. Lead appeared to interfere with an early event in the MAF-induced activation process. In addition, lead decreased the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose by macrophages, suggesting that the metal might inhibit trans-membrane glucose-transport systems, a phenomenon that might explain in part the metabolic inhibition observed in lead-treated cells.",M1
2496192,"Lead inhibits intracellular killing of Leishmania parasites and extracellular cytolysis of target cells by macrophages exposed to macrophage activating factor.Activation of Leishmania enriettii-infected mouse macrophages in vitro by treatment with macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>)-rich media supplemented with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to rapid killing of the microorganism. When exposed to MAF + LPS in the presence of 30-100 microM lead acetate, however, macrophages failed to destroy the parasites. This effect was not due to lead toxicity for macrophages. Decreased microbicidal activity correlated with depressed respiratory burst as determined by measurements of glucose oxidation through the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS). Lead had little effect on intracellular parasite killing induced by exposure of macrophages to the electron carrier methylene blue; HMPS in such cells was similarly little affected, indicating that chemical triggering of this pathway bypassed the lead-imposed blockade. Lead also abolished macrophage activation measured by the lysis of tumor target cells in vitro. The metal failed, however, to interfere with target-cell lysis by macrophages activated in lead-free medium, suggesting that lead inhibited the acquisition of the activated state rather than the functional expression of such state. Lead did not prevent the binding of radiolabelled interferon-gamma to macrophages; it did, however, slow down receptor turnover and degradation of bound interferon. Lead also inhibited the LPS-triggered cytotoxicity in macrophages previously exposed to interferon-gamma in lead-free medium, suggesting that depressed intracellular killing might result from an effect on both the priming (interferon or MAF-dependent) and the triggering (LPS-dependent) steps of activation.",M1
2647882,"Oxidative responses of rabbit alveolar macrophages: comparative priming activities of MIF/<e>MAF</e>, sera, and serum components.The comparative abilities of various reagents to prime rabbit alveolar macrophages (AM) to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in a chemiluminescent (CL) assay were investigated. It was noted that AM from normal rabbits cultured in a serum-free medium for 18 hr exhibited a  spontaneous  priming response following a challenge with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA); however,  spontaneous  priming was not evident when the AM were cultured for only 3 hr. It was further established that pretreatment of normal AM for 3 or 18 hr with MIF/MAF preparations (serum-free), fetal bovine serum (FBS), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) exhibited marked increases in their CL responses following challenge with PMA. When FBS was used in the culture medium, the priming activity of MIF/MAF was masked because of the high CL responses of controls due to the priming effects of FBS. BSA at concentrations approximately equivalent to the amount in FBS also displayed marked priming activity. Bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide and muramyl dipeptide), latex particles, rabbit IgG, PMA, and opsonized as well as nonopsonized zymosan and bacteria (BCG and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were inactive as priming agents. In comparison, AM from BCG-immune rabbits that were primed in vivo yielded a very large CL response when challenged with PMA. Opsonized zymosan and bacteria produced twofold increases in the CL responses in BCG-immune AM compared to nonopsonized preparations. The marked priming effect of serum on AM cultured for even a short period (3 hr) indicates that normal AM undergo marked changes in culture that complicate the interpretation of AM function when AM are cultured in vitro in media containing serum.",M1
2646027,"L-fucose blocks MIF/<e>MAF</e> priming of rabbit alveolar macrophages for a PMA-induced oxidative response.The effect of L-fucose on the priming of AM from normal adult rabbits and their subsequent chemiluminescent (CL) responses to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was investigated. It was observed that 12.5 mM L-fucose, but not D-fucose, blocked the  spontaneous  priming of normal AM during an 18-hr incubation period in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium by about 40% (P less than 0.01) as detected by their CL responses to a PMA challenge. In addition, the optimal concentration of L-fucose (12.5 mM) blocked MIF/MAF priming during the 3- or 18-hr incubation period by 71 or 93% (P less than 0.05), respectively, as determined by their CL responses following PMA challenge. It is of particular significance that D-fucose was inactive. These results, together with previously published data, indicate that L-fucose (a) blocks priming of AM for an oxidative response, (b) stimulates random migration of AM, and (c) reverses migration inhibition produced by migration inhibition factor.",M1
2642945,"Identification of a macrophage-activating factor in granules of the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemia.Recent work from our laboratory has shown that NK cells rapidly release preformed factor(s) that stimulate monocyte oxidative metabolism and microbicidal activity. We have hypothesized that such factors could also activate macrophage (M phi) tumor lysis and might be stored in the cytoplasmic granules. Granules were isolated from the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemias by nitrogen cavitation and Percoll fractionation of the cell homogenate. Utilizing CSF-1 differentiated murine bone marrow-derived M phi and P815 tumor target cells, a M phi-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) was found. The MAF activity was identified in two peaks, the first was coincident with dense granule enzymes and was 60 times more concentrated per mg protein than a second peak in the cytosol fractions. Solubilization in 2 M NaCl was necessary to recover activity from both peaks. Granule NK-MAF required the simultaneous presence of LPS in order to induce tumoricidal activity. Kinetics of NK-MAF activation peaked after 12 h of exposure. The NK-MAF was short lived in the solubilized granules; however, its heat resistance allowed us to prepare enriched and stable preparations. Treatment of NK-MAF with pepsin but not trypsin completely abrogated its activity. The NK-MAF passed through an ultrafiltration membrane with a nominal cut-off of 10 kDa. This work indicates that NK cell granules contain a small heat-stable peptide capable of activating M phi tumoricidal activity.",M1
2646299,"Purification and sequencing of glycosylation variants of BSF-1, as a <e>MAF</e>, from the EL-4 leukaemia cell line.Macrophage activation activity was characterized from a PMA-induced subclone of the murine EL-4 leukaemic cell line. The MAF was purified from the cell line culture supernatant by concentration, CM-Sepharose and lentil lectin Sepharose chromatography, AcA 54 gel filtration, Mono Q FPLC and reverse phase HPLC. Four protein bands of different abundance were observed on SDS-PAGE with molecular weights of 17,500 to 21,000 Da. Three of the four proteins were sequenced from the N-terminal and shared homology with the published sequence of BSF-1. Variation of the molecular weight due to glycosylation was demonstrated by N-glycanase treatment, all four proteins gave a band of 14,200 Da after deglycosylation. Both glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of BSF-1 were equally active in the MAF assay. A monoclonal antibody to BSF-1 neutralized 80% of the activity from crude culture supernatants in the MAF assay. These studies have indicated that BSF-1 is the major, if not the only, MAF activity from this particular subline of the murine EL-4 leukaemic cell line.",M1
2509820,"Partial purification of a macrophage-activating factor for glucose consumption (<e>MAF</e>-G) produced by a human T-cell hybridoma and its relation to a growth-promoting factor.A material that enhances the glucose consumption of oil-induced peritoneal macrophages of guinea pig, the activity being named MAF-G activity, was purified approximately 780-fold from human T cell hybridoma conditioned medium. A material showing growth-promoting activity was co-purified with that showing the MAF-G activity from the same conditioned medium. The two materials showed an identical isoelectric point of pH 4.7. When the partially purified MAF-G increased glucose consumption, it did not induce glucose carbon-1 oxidation. MAF-G activity was inhibited by mitomycin C and colchicine, which inhibit DNA synthesis and mitosis, respectively, but not by 2-deoxy-D-glucose, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism. The partially purified MAF-G also enhanced the glucose consumption and proliferation of human monocytes. These observations suggest that MAF-G may be identical with the growth-promoting factor for macrophages.",M1

Significant decrease in number of microbes within the peritoneal cavity, spleen, and liver from the mice of NACOS-6-administered group was not observed 1 day after the infection but 4 days after the infection. Administration of NACOS-6 enhanced the delayed-type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or heat-killed L. monocytogenes. Splenic T lymphocytes from mice administered NACOS-6 released macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>). These results suggested that NACOS-6 was also able to elevate the function of cellular immunity. Macrophages treated with a combination of NACOS-6 and the culture supernatant of splenic T lymphocytes from mice administered NACOS-6,  NACOS-6 sup,  were found to exert a fairly strong growth-inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were able to enhance the growth-inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes by the NACOS-6-treated macrophages.",M1

The administration of NKT-01 increased the numbers of cells recovered from the popliteal lymph node (PLN) 7 days after inoculation, but inhibited the proliferation of these cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). NKT-01 enhanced IL-2 production, but suppressed the production of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) in the mixed lymphocyte reaction between the PLN cells and allogeneic spleen cells treated with mitomycin C. CyA decreased the numbers of PLN cells little, and suppressed the response to exogenous IL-2 and the production of both IL-2 and MAF. Results with tumor cells used as allogeneic cells suggested that there was a close relationship between the suppression of MAF production by NKT-01 and its inhibition of allograft rejection. The findings showed that NKT-01 inhibited both the MAF production by and the response to IL-2 of PLN cells, and that these effects were involved in the suppression of allograft rejection by NKT-01.",M1

Both respiratory burst activity (nitroblue tetrazolium, NBT, reduction and H2O2 production) and bactericidal activity were enhanced after incubation of resident or elicited macrophages with the MAF-containing supernatants for 48-72 hr.

2842545,"Role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the host defense mechanism against lung cancer.Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) were recovered from 22 patients with primary lung cancer. The TIL did not exhibit any cytolytic activity against various target cells. The average percentage of TIL recovered was 6.7 +/- 1.3% in patients without recurrence, as compared to 3.6 +/- 0.6% in those with recurrence within 2 years after complete resection of lung cancer (P less than 0.05). The average cytostatic activity of TAM was 38.5 +/- 6.8% in patients without recurrence, although it was 25.2 +/- 4.6% in those with recurrence within 2 years after complete resection (P less than 0.1). The activity of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) induced by TIL was also higher in patients showing no recurrence. A significant positive correlation was observed between MAF activity induced by TIL and the cytostatic activity of individual TAM. These results suggest that antitumor activity of TAM may be controlled by specifically sensitized TIL through lymphokines.",M1
3050799,"Macrophage activation in vitro by lymphocytes from Leishmania major infected healer and non-healer mice.Peritoneal macrophages from CBA/T6 (healer) and BALB/c (non-healer) mice were infected with Leishmania major (LV39) in vitro. The microorganism replicated at the same rate in macrophages from either strain. Exposure of infected cells to lymph node cells (LNC) from infected syngeneic animals led to intracellular killing of the parasite by macrophages from both strains, provided LPS was present in the incubation medium. In vitro-propagated L.major-specific T-cell blasts activated macrophages from either strain in the absence of LPS. On a per cell basis, lymphoid cells from BALB/c mice were less efficient, however, than cells from CBA/T6 mice. Lysis of parasitized macrophages was also more marked in CBA/T6 than in BALB/c cell mixtures. LNC exposed to parasite antigen or to infected macrophages secreted macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>); incubation with antigen also induced lymphocyte proliferation. MAF production and LNC proliferation decreased with progression of the infection of BALB/c mice, but always remained significant. The reduction in relative T-cell numbers in the lymph nodes of infected animals was moderate; the absolute number of T-cells increased markedly in the lymphoid organs of both strains, however. These results suggest that failure to heal may coexist together with active cell-mediated immune response in non-healer mice.",M1
2456605,"Modulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression by interferons and microbial agents. Independent regulation of MHC class II expression and induction of tumoricidal activity in bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes.In a pure population of rat bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes (BMM phi), the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and ability to manifest tumoricidal activity were simultaneously studied. Resting BMM phi, which express low levels of MHC class II molecules and do not manifest tumoricidal activity, become strongly MHC class II-positive, and evolve tumoricidal activity within 24 h when incubated with macrophage-activating lymphokines (<e>MAF</e>) or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). In contrast, BMM phi which were interacted for 24 h with heat-killed microbial agents (Corynebacterium parvum, Listeria) evolve tumoricidal activity without parallel enhancement of MHC class II expression. IFN-alpha,beta neither induced tumoricidal activity nor enhanced MHC class II expression. Further experiments have shown that (a) the kinetics of MAF- and/or IFN-gamma-induced amplification of MHC class II expression and of tumoricidal activity are different; (b) enhancement of MHC class II expression by rIFN-gamma is not invariably paralleled by induction of tumoricidal activity; and (c) inhibitors of macrophage tumoricidal activity differ in their ability to affect MHC class II expression. It is concluded from these findings that in a population of pure BMM phi, i.e. in the complete absence of lymphocytes, the expression of MHC molecules and induction of tumoricidal activity are independently regulated phenomena; in particular, the enhanced expression of MHC class II molecules is not a prerequisite for induction and/or manifestation of tumoricidal activity by mononuclear phagocytes.",M1
3136079,"Preactivation of macrophages in mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni.This paper shows that peritoneal murine macrophages become preactivated in vivo during the course of a Schistosoma mansoni infection. Thus, less macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) was required to induce in vitro tumoricidal and schistosomulicidal activity in macrophages from S. mansoni-infected mice than in macrophages from uninfected control animals. Moreover, the respiratory burst activity, as measured by chemiluminescence, was enhanced in macrophages from S. mansoni-infected mice as compared to controls, whether or not lymphokine (LK) was present in the macrophage cultures. This response appeared at 3 weeks and persisted at least until 12 weeks after infection. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is most likely involved in the mechanisms leading to such an increased cytolytic and oxidative activity, since in vitro experiments showed: 1) that less IFN-gamma was required to induce tumoricidal activity in macrophages from infected as compared to macrophages from uninfected animals, 2) that the activity of (2'-5')-adenylate synthetase (2'-5' A-synthetase), an enzyme strongly induced by IFN, was elevated in cells from livers of S. mansoni-infected mice.",M1

The macrophage activating factor from a T cell line, CCRF-CEM, was characterized biochemically and compared with interferon-gamma, which is also an immunological product of T cells and has a potent macrophage activating activity. In contrast to interferon-gamma, the macrophage activating factor in the culture supernatants bound to an anion exchanger and did not adsorb onto concanavalin A gel. Culture supernatants and active fractions from chromatographies were essentially devoid of anti-viral activity. Anti-human interferon-gamma monoclonal antibody also failed to neutralize the macrophage activating factor from CCRF-CEM. <e>MAF</e> was eluted in the fractions with molecular weight of 40,000 to 60,000 on gel filtration in the presence of a detergent and a salt.

Test triggering agents were injected intravenously into mice after intravenous injection of 4-fold dilution of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) or 10(4) units of murine interferon-gamma (Mu-IFN-gamma). Then sera were obtained from the mice, and their TNF activities were assayed on L-929 cells by the method of Ruff and Gifford. The triggering activity of BPV was the highest among those of conventional triggers, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli, and OK-432. The levels of serum TNF activity triggered by BPV (4 X 10(9) cells), LPS of E. coli (3 micrograms) and OK-432 (3 KE) were 5350, 85 and 102 units/ml, respectively. Growth of MM46, a spontaneous mammary carcinoma cell line of C3H/He was observed for 35 days after tumor inoculation and was suppressed significantly by intravenous injection of MAF and BPV (4 X 10(9) cells). On local injection of BPV (2 X 10(9) cells) into murine tumors, complete regression was observed in 67% of the mice tested with or without MAF priming on day 25 after tumor inoculation, and intratumoral TNF activity was observed even in the case of the single injection of BPV.",M1
3276784,"Molecular mechanisms involved in T cell activation. III. The role of extracellular calcium in antigen-induced lymphokine production and interleukin 2-induced proliferation of cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes.The role that extracellular calcium plays in activating resting cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to proliferate and to produce lymphokines was examined. In these cells, stimulation with interleukin 2 (IL-2) induced a proliferative response without a concomitant production of macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>), whereas stimulation with antigen or lectin (in the absence of IL-2) induced MAF production but not proliferation. In the case of IL-2-induced proliferation, extracellular calcium was required to initiate proliferation as well as to prevent cellular arrest later in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle. In MAF production extracellular calcium was required both to activate the phosphatidylinositol signal-transducing mechanism and to mobilize intracellular calcium in antigen- or lectin-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Further, extracellular calcium was required for only 8 of the 18 hr of stimulation time which was needed to achieve maximal MAF production, indicating that both calcium-dependent and -independent events exist in the signal pathway. Additional experiments with calcium ionophores and activators of protein kinase C indicated that although both intracellular calcium mobilization and de novo protein phosphorylation are involved in MAF production, an optimal increase in the level of intracellular calcium by itself is insufficient to induce the production of this lymphokine.",M1
2832308,"Immunity to Schistosoma mansoni in guinea-pigs vaccinated with radiation-attenuated cercariae. T-cell activation of macrophages for larval killing.This study addresses macrophage activation in guinea-pigs vaccinated with radiation-attenuated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Peritoneal exudate macrophages elicited in vaccinated animals by mineral oil injection were activated to kill larval schistosomes in vitro. Killing efficiency is dependent upon the cell: target ratio employed and is enhanced by, but is not strictly dependent on, the presence of specific antibodies. Macrophages co-cultured with parasites release superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, but the use of inhibitors has shown that neither of these reactive oxygen intermediates are the causal agents of cellular cytotoxicity in this system. Oil-elicited macrophages from naive guinea-pigs do not show comparable activation; they can, however, be activated in vitro by incubation with culture supernatant fluids from schistosome antigen-stimulated spleen, or lymph node cells harvested from vaccinated guinea-pigs. Naive macrophages activated in this way kill schistosomula in vitro and release the activation markers IL-1 and superoxide anion. The macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) present in spleen cell culture supernatant fluids has a MW of 35,000-55,000, but does not have the chemical characteristics of gamma-interferon. In this study MAF is shown to be released by a population of lymph node cells that does not adhere to nylon-wool columns, that responds well in proliferation assays to schistosome antigens and to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A, but does not respond to the B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide.

3316511,"Preparation and antitumor effect of macrophage activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) encapsulated in liposomes bearing a monoclonal anti-human melanoma (A375) antibody.We prepared large unilamellar vesicles containing the cell-free culture supernatant of a human T cell hybridoma rich in macrophage activating factor (MAF) and bearing monoclonal antibodies against human melanoma A375 tumor cells; their antitumor activity against A375 cells was examined in vitro and in vivo. Both MAF-immunoliposomes (bearing antibodies) and MAF liposomes (not bearing antibodies) showed macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro at a high E/T ratio (about 40). But at a low E/T ratio (about 15), only MAF-immunoliposomes showed tumoricidal activity, their activity being more than ten thousand-fold stronger compared with a soluble MAF preparation (MAF solution). MAF-immunoliposomes not only showed tumor neutralization mediated by macrophages in vivo when a mixture of tumor cells, macrophages, and MAF-immunoliposomes was locally injected, but also showed significant inhibition of tumor growth on repeated i.v. systemic administration of them. On the other hand, other samples (MAF-liposomes without the antibody, a MAF solution, and immunoliposomes without MAF) were not significantly effective against tumor growth. These results may constitute evidence that the delivery of lymphokines to the tumor sites is important or even critical when an attempt is made to treat cancer with lymphokines with the expectation of the potentiation of the host's immune system.",M1
3115596,"Mechanism of cyclosporin A-induced immunosuppression. Cyclosporin A inhibits receptor-mediated and non-receptor-mediated lymphokine production as well as interleukin-2-induced proliferation in cloned T lymphocytes.The effects of cyclosporin A (CyA) on the activation processes of cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been examined. With the use of Day 7 resting cloned CTL it was possible to separate the functions of lymphokine production (macrophage-activating factor, <e>MAF</e>) and interleukin 2 (IL-2)-induced proliferation of these cells. The effect of CyA on each of these activities was analyzed independently. CyA was found to inhibit both receptor-mediated MAF production in response to stimulation with antigen and lectin and MAF production in response to non-receptor-mediated stimulation (by anti-Thy-1 antibodies, ionophore, and phorbol ester). Further, CyA was observed to inhibit the re-entry of these resting CTL into the cell cycle upon stimulation with IL-2. The effect of CyA on MAF production did not appear to be due to inhibition of the signal-transducing mechanism involved in this process (i.e., inositol lipid hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, and protein phosphorylation). The action of CyA on the IL-2-induced proliferation was not due to inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression or the binding of IL-2 to its receptor. Thus, CyA appeared to mediate its suppressive effects on MAF production and IL-2-induced proliferation through an action on some later step(s) in the signal pathways of these activities.",M1

The monosaccharides L-fucose and D-mannose were also shown to reverse MIF and additionally to stimulate alveolar macrophage (AM) migration in the absence of MIF. The specific activity of these sugars was increased 200-fold when conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Macrophage activation is usually observed concurrently with migration inhibition when macrophages are incubated with MIF preparations. Migration inhibition occurred also when AM were incubated in the presence of known metabolic activators (MDP, PMA, and LPS). It was found that L-fucose, D-mannose, L-fucosyl BSA, and D-mannosyl BSA could reverse migration inhibition caused by MIF as well as by these metabolic activators. These observations suggest that reversal of MIF by L-fucose is unexplained solely on the basis that L-fucose is functioning as a competitive inhibitor; instead, they suggest that MEF and the above sugars and their conjugates stimulate AM through a receptor system different from the MIF receptor. These observations support the concept that MEF is an important macrophage modulator in CMI responses.",M1

This macrophage activation factor (<e>MAF</e>) is both physicochemically (Mr 25,000; pH 2 stable) and biologically different from interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). However, EL-4 MAF may represent a breakdown product or otherwise altered fragment of IFN-gamma. We examined this possibility with a unique pair of hamster monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of murine IFN-gamma. Both antibodies inhibited IFN-gamma-induced fibroblast antiviral activity; H21 but not H1 antibody also inhibited lymphokine (LK)-induced macrophage-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. Neither antibody, however, had any effect on the EL-4 MAF throughout a broad dose response. Moreover, passage through a H21 immunoaffinity chromatography column or addition of staphylococcal protein A and antibody completely inhibited LK-induced macrophage tumoricidal activity but did not affect the activity in EL-4 MAF. Identical effects in both fluid and solid phase were observed with polyclonal rabbit antisera to murine IFN-gamma. Results with all of these antibodies strongly suggest that the EL-4 MAF and murine IFN-gamma are antigenically distinct.",M1

Peptone-induced Mph were cultivated for 20-22 hours in the presence of crude supernatants from concanavalin-A-stimulated spleen cells or from the secondary mixed lymphocyte culture. 3H-thymidine-labelled cells of mastocytoma P815 were then added to the washed Mph. The lysis was measured in 48 hours according to the isotope remainder in the non-acid-soluble fraction. The optimal conditions for MAF detection have been selected. Parallel MAF testing with this particular method and with a standard technique using labelled 51Cr TC made it possible to conclude that the method suggested is more sensitive because it permits a combined cultivation of Mph and TC for a relatively long time period.",M1

A MAF-O-producing human T-cell hybridoma, F4-29-4, was established which was also found to produce macrophage activating factor for glucose consumption (MAF-G) and colony stimulating factor (CSF) when assayed against mouse bone marrow cells. MAF-O could be successfully separated from CSF but not from MAF-G by phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography (Phenyl-EG-fraction). To differentiate MAF-O from MAF-G and to explore a route for large scale production of MAF-O and its structural elucidation, total messenger RNA was extracted from a human T-cell hybridoma, clone F4-29-4. This messenger RNA was fractionated on 5-30% sucrose gradient and each fraction was microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. MAF-O activity was found in the supernatant of oocytes injected with messenger RNA sedimentated at about 13.0S, while MAF-G messenger RNA was found to be about 10.5S. The MAF-O activity, synthesized from the injected messenger RNA, was not neutralized with an excess amount of anti-human IFN-gamma anti-serum, suggesting that MAF-O is antigenically different from human IFN-gamma.",M1
3545500,"Altered cell-averaged microviscosity of murine peritoneal macrophages undergoing activation in vivo or in vitro.The cell-averaged microviscosity of intact murine peritoneal mononuclear phagocytes in various stages of activation was assessed by quantifying fluorescent depolarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Macrophages activated in vivo with Mycobacterium bovis, strain BCG, were significantly more fluid than resident peritoneal macrophages, responsive macrophages elicited with thioglycollate broth, proteose peptone broth, or fetal bovine serum, or primed macrophages elicited with pyran copolymer, MVE-2. Specifically, the cell-averaged microviscosity decreased from a mean of 3.47 +/- .07 eta 25 degrees C (poise) (range of 3.32 to 3.67 p) to 2.62 eta 25 degrees C. Exposure of responsive macrophages in vitro to bacterial endotoxin plus hybridoma supernatants containing macrophage-activating factor or purified recombinant interferon gamma resulted in decreased microviscosity; the largest effect was seen after 24 hr. Macrophages primed in vivo with MVE-2 and treated in vitro with endotoxin also developed decreased microviscosity. Similar changes in microviscosity were observed in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction isolated from macrophages activated in vitro with interferon gamma and endotoxin, thus suggesting that the cell-averaged measurements reflected changes in membrane viscosity. The optimum concentration of <e>MAF</e>-inducing decreased overall microviscosity was identical to that for inducing tumoricidal capacity. Taken together, the data indicate activation of lytic capacity in murine macrophages is closely associated with decreased cell-averaged microviscosity and that this change reflects, at least in part, decreased microviscosity of the plasma membrane of these cells.",M1
3540124,"Molecular mechanisms involved in T cell activation. II. The phosphatidylinositol signal-transducing mechanism mediates antigen-induced lymphokine production but not interleukin 2-induced proliferation in cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes.The phospholipid metabolism of cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was examined under conditions in which the induction of proliferation by interleukin 2 (IL 2) and the stimulated production of lymphokine (macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>] by concanavalin A (Con A) and specific antigen occurred independently of each other. Activation of the CTL by either of the latter two stimuli resulted in changes in the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol (PI) that were early (less than 2.5 min), specific, and prolonged (6 to 8 hr). These changes were primarily characterized by an increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) and PI, with a decrease in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The duration of these phospholipid responses, particularly PA and PI, approximated the minimum time of CTL-stimulus interaction required to produce maximal titers of MAF. No changes were observed in other major classes of phospholipids during 8 hr of continuous stimulation. Stimulation with an irrelevant antigen had no effect on CTL phospholipid metabolism. In contrast to specific antigen or Con A, the T cell growth factor IL 2 failed to elicit specific and early biosynthetic responses from PA and PI. Instead, there were nonspecific biosynthetic responses from all major phospholipid classes (including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, as well as PA and PI) which occurred between 1 and 6 hr after IL 2 stimulation. Both 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol phosphates (IP), the hydrolytic products of PI turnover, were produced in response to MAF-inducing stimuli, but neither were detected in response to the proliferative stimulus IL 2. Together, these results indicate that the hydrolysis of PI and the concomitant production of the putative second messengers DAG and IP are involved in signaling the production of lymphokines (MAF) by CTL. On the other hand, the failure of IL 2 to elicit a full-spectrum PI response suggests that signals mediating CTL proliferation may utilize an alternate and still undefined pathway.",M1
3540123,"Molecular mechanisms involved in T cell activation. I. Evidence for independent signal-transducing pathways in lymphokine production vs proliferation in cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes.It is well-established that activated T cells proliferate in response to interleukin 2 (IL 2) and produce various soluble lymphokines such as macrophage-activating factor (<e>MAF</e>) in response to antigen. Prior to investigating the molecular events involved in signaling the initiation of these responses in cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), we determined whether these responses could occur independently, and we established for each response the time during which signal transducing mechanisms may function. It was found that this cloned CTL population was in a resting state (G1 phase of cell cycle) 7 days after stimulation with antigen plus IL 2. At this time, the incubation of these resting CTL with IL 2 for 4 to 6 hr resulted in a maximal proliferative response that was not accompanied by the production of MAF. Conversely, the incubation of resting CTL with antigen or lectin (in the absence of IL 2) for at least 8 hr resulted in the maximal production of MAF at 24 hr without inducing a proliferative response. In addition, antigen or lectin, but not IL 2, triggered an immediate (less than 1 min) and sustained (at least 8 hr) mobilization of intracellular calcium. The kinetics of this calcium response paralleled the minimum time (8 hr) that was required for resting CTL to interact with either antigen or lectin in order to produce maximal titers of MAF. These results indicate that proliferation and lymphokine (MAF) production in cloned murine CTL are independent events. In these resting CTL, the signal mechanisms that mediate the production of lymphokines are most likely restricted to the initial 8 hr of stimulation by antigen or lectin and involve the rapid and prolonged mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium. Proliferative signals, however, are probably complete within 4 to 6 hr after stimulation by IL 2 and do not involve readily demonstrable fluxes of cytoplasmic calcium, as determined by the fluorescent calcium probe Quin 2.",M1

Molecular characterization of MAF produced by the tumor-immune Lyt-1+2- T cell subset.In the present study we investigated some of the physicochemical properties of macrophage-activating factor(s) (MAF) produced by the tumor-immune Lyt-1+2- T cell subset. Supernatant from mixed culture of spleen and lymph node cells, obtained from C3H/HeN mice immunized with syngeneic MH134 hepatoma or MCH-1-A1 fibrosarcoma, with the corresponding tumor cells exhibited the capability of activating peritoneal exudate macrophages to exert their cytostatic and cytolytic activities on tumor cells. Such MAF production was abolished by treatment of tumor-immune spleen and lymph node cells with anti-Thy-1.2 or anti-Lyt-1.1 antibody plus complement (C) before culturing. Anti-Lyt-2.1 and/or anti-asialo GM1 plus C treatment, however, had only marginal effect on the generation of MAF by these cells, despite the complete disappearance of natural killer (NK) cell activity of spleen and lymph node cells after the treatment with anti-asialo GM1 plus C. Thus, the tumor-specific Lyt-1+2- T cell subset could fulfill a crucial role in generating MAF without the support of NK cells. The MAF activity was heat, acid, and trypsin sensitive. On Sephacryl S-300 column, MAF activity was eluated in a broad single peak around a molecular weight (m.w.) of 70,000 daltons. Antiviral activity was detected in the concentrated pool of MAF-containing fractions from Sephacryl S-300. Gel permeation analysis using HPLC also showed a coincident peak of MAF and antiviral activities at a m.w. of approximately 70,000 daltons. In addition, MAF activity was almost completely neutralized by incubation with rabbit antiserum against recombinant murine gamma-interferon (IFN gamma). Taken together, these results indicate that MAF generated by tumor-immune Lyt-1+2- T cell subset is closely related to IFN gamma.",M1
3116372,"Human macrophage-activating factors for cytotoxicity. II. Synergism of two factors produced by a human T-cell hybridoma that induce the cytotoxicity of human monocytes.Two different factors (<e>MAF</e>-C I and MAF-C II) were obtained by anion exchange chromatography of the culture supernatant of a human T-cell hybridoma, H3-E9-6, which produces macrophage-activating factors for cytotoxicity (MAF-C). These 2 factors induced the cytotoxicity of monocytes synergistically as a priming signal (MAF-C I) and a triggering signal (MAF-C II), respectively. On gel filtration on a column of Superose 12, MAF-C II was eluted mainly at the void volume, whereas MAF-C I was eluted in the fractions corresponding to approximate molecular weights of 30-300 K. On the other hand, gel filtration in the presence of sodium deoxycholate revealed that MAF-C II has an approximate molecular weight of 40,000, but MAF-C I was unstable under these conditions. When the activity for mouse macrophages (MAF-Cm activity) was tested, the MAF-C II fraction showed high MAF-Cm activity in the presence of murine recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma), but the MAF-C I fraction did not show MAF-Cm activity even in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These results suggest that MAF-C I (priming lymphokine) has species specificity but MAF-C II (triggering lymphokine) does not.",M1
3116371,"Human macrophage-activating factors for cytotoxicity. I. Establishment of a human T-cell hybridoma that produces macrophage-activating factors for cytotoxicity.Human T cell hybridoma, H3-E9-6, that produces macrophage activating factors for cytotoxicity (<e>MAF</e>-C) was prepared by somatic fusion of phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes with emetine/actinomycin D-treated cloned human acute lymphocytic leukemia cells (CEM 11). The activities of the following were assayed: (1) macrophage-activating factor for cytotoxicity of monocytes (MAF-C 1 day), (2) macrophage-activating factor for cytotoxicity of monocyte-derived macrophages (MAF-C 6 day), (3) macrophage-activating factor for cytotoxicity of murine macrophages (MAF-Cm), (4) macrophage-activating factor for glucose consumption (MAF-G), (5) macrophage-activating factor for O2- formation (MAF-O). The culture supernatant of H3-E9-6 showed MAF-C 1 day-MAF-C 6 day, MAF-Cm, and MAF-G activities. The MAF-Cm activity was considerably enhanced by the addition of murine recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma). The MAF-C 1 day activity in the H3-E9-6 sup was not decreased by heat treatment (56 C, 30 min), by pH 2 treatment or by the addition of monoclonal anti-human IFN-gamma antibody or polymyxin B. These data suggest that MAF-C in H3-E9-6 sup is distinct from human IFN-gamma or lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",M1
3102242,"Identity between human interferon-gamma and  macrophage-activating factor  produced by human T lymphocytes.Human peripheral blood monocytes purified by counterflow elutriation were activated in vitro by human natural or recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) as shown by enhanced killing of Listeria monocytogenes and increased production of H2O2 in response to phorbol myristate acetate. Half-maximal stimulation for macrophage activation (<e>MAF</e>) was observed with 10-20 antiviral U/ml of purified recombinant IFN-gamma. These MAF activities were found to correlate with the antiviral activity dependent on IFN-gamma under several experimental conditions. Both activities were recovered together from supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in the media of a large number of T cell clones of different specificities. The parallelism between the two activities was also observed upon fractionation of culture media from producing cells and upon treatment of such preparations with low pH and high temperature. Finally, three antibodies with different specificities were found to abrogate the MAF and antiviral activities from lymphocyte culture supernatant. These results indicate that MAF released by stimulated lymphocytes is identical to IFN-gamma.",M1
19821532,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is a positive regulator of human bile salt export pump expression.The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is the major determinant of bile salt-dependent bile secretion, and its deficiency leads to cholestatic liver injury. BSEP/Bsep gene expression is regulated by the nuclear farnesoid X receptor. However, BSEP expression, though reduced, is retained in the livers of Fxr(-/-) mice, indicating that additional transcriptional factors may regulate its expression. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a major role in response to oxidative stress by binding to antioxidant-responsive elements that regulate many hepatic phase I and II enzymes as well as hepatic efflux transporters. Computer software analysis of human BSEP reveals two musculo-aponeurotic fibrosacroma (<e>Maf</e>) recognition elements (MAREs) from the sequence in the proximal promoter region where Nrf2 may bind. In this study, we assessed whether Nrf2 plays a role in human BSEP expression and if this might be mediated by MAREs. Oltipraz, a potent activator of Nrf2, increased BSEP messenger RNA expression by approximately seven-fold in HepG2 cells and protein by approximately 70% in human hepatocytes. Small interfering RNAs lowered NRF2 expression in HepG2 cells and prevented the up-regulation of BSEP by oltipraz. Human BSEP promoter activity was stimulated by Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner in luciferase reporter assays. Mutations of the predicted MARE1, but not MARE2, abolished this Nrf2 transcriptional activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrated that Nrf2 specifically bound to MARE1, but not MARE2 regions in the BSEP promoter in HepG2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays further demonstrated direct binding of MARE1 in the BSEP promoter. CONCLUSION: Nrf2 is a positive transcriptional regulator of human BSEP expression. Pharmacological activation of Nrf2 may be beneficial for cholestatic liver injury.",M2
18201722,"Small <e>Maf</e> proteins in mammalian gene control: mere dimerization partners or dynamic transcriptional regulators?The small Maf basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins MafF, MafG and MafK, while modest in size, have emerged as crucial regulators of mammalian gene expression. Intriguingly, small Mafs do not contain an obvious transcriptional activation domain. However, previously perceived as  mere  partner molecules conferring DNA binding specificity to complexes with larger bZIP proteins, such as the CNC family member Nrf2, it has become clear that small Maf proteins are essential and dynamically regulated transcription factors. Current data suggest stringent control of small Maf protein function through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. Initial gene targeting experiments revealed considerable functional redundancy among small Maf proteins in vivo. This was not unexpected, due to the high level of homology among the three small Mafs. Nevertheless, further studies showed that these transcription factors have critical roles in various cellular processes, including stress signaling, hematopoiesis, CNS function and oncogenesis. Recent data provide a possible link between small Maf-mediated transcription and the inflammatory response.",M2
17569705,"Multiple mechanisms and functions of <e>maf</e> transcription factors in the regulation of tissue-specific genes.Maf family transcription factors are regulators of tissue-specific gene expression and cell-differentiation in a wide variety of tissues and are also involved in human diseases and oncogenic transformation. To establish tissue-specific expression, Maf binds to Maf-recognition elements (MAREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes, and functionally interacts with other transcription factors. For example, L-Maf and c-Maf, which are specifically expressed in developing lens cells, act synergistically with Sox proteins to induce lens-specific crystalline genes. MafA, a beta-cell-specific member of the Maf family, activates the insulin gene promoter synergistically with Pdx1 and Beta2 to establish beta-cell specific expression. Furthermore, in beta-cells, MafA activity is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels by glucose and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the functions and roles of Maf in various biological processes and recent progress in elucidating the mechanisms whereby Maf proteins regulate transcription.",M2
17428264,"L-<e>Maf</e> regulates p27kip1 expression during chick lens fiber differentiation.Organ formation requires spatio-temporal proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells. During lens development, placodal cells in the posterior lens vesicle exit from the cell cycle and enter into the process of differentiation. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play critical roles in cell cycle exit and promote differentiation in several tissues. We have found that p27kip1 is expressed in the posterior lens cells that undergo differentiation to form the differentiated fiber cells. The transcription factor L-Maf is expressed in these cells earlier than p27kip1. From in ovo gain- or loss-of-function experiments, we have found that L-Maf can, respectively, induce or inhibit the expression of p27kip1 in lens cells. Promoter assays using the 5' upstream sequences of the human p27kip1 gene indicate that L-Maf can activate p27kip1 transcription through the basal regulatory region. We suggest that L-Maf regulates cell cycle exit of the posterior lens cells by activating p27kip1, and thus directs fiber cell differentiation during lens formation in chick.",M2

17262012,"Sequential and combinatorial roles of <e>maf</e> family genes define proper lens development.PURPOSE: Maf proteins have been shown to play pivotal roles in lens development in vertebrates. The developing chick lens expresses at least three large Maf proteins. However, the transcriptional relationship among the three large maf genes and their various roles in transactivating the downstream genes largely remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Chick embryos were electroporated with wild-type L-maf, c-maf, and mafB by in ovo electroporation, and their effects on gene expression were determined by in situ hybridization using specific probes or by immunostaining. Endogenous gene expression was determined using nonelectroporated samples. RESULTS: A regulation mechanism exists among the members of maf family gene. An early-expressed member of this gene family typically stimulates the expression of later-expressed members. We also examined the regulation of various lens-expressing genes with a focus on the interaction between different Maf proteins. We found that the transcriptional ability of Maf proteins varies, even when the target is the same, in parallel with their discrete functions. L-Maf and c-Maf have no effect on E-cadherin expression, whereas MafB enhances its expression and thereby impedes lens vesicle formation. This study also revealed that Maf proteins can regulate the expression of gap junction genes, connexins, and their interacting partner, major intrinsic protein (MIP), during lens development. Misexpression of L-Maf and c-Maf induces ectopic expression of Cx43 and MIP; in contrast, MafB appears to have no effect on Cx43, but induces MIP significantly as evidenced from our gain-of-function experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that large Maf function is indispensable for chick lens initiation and development. In addition, L-Maf positively regulates most of the essential genes in this program and directs a series of molecular events leading to proper formation of the lens.",M2
17129360,"Carcinogenesis and transcriptional regulation through <e>Maf</e> recognition elements.Many studies on carcinogenesis carried out early in the last century are united on the consensus that cancer is a genetic disease. Cancer cells typically display gene dysfunction and endogenous or exogenous insults resulting in gene dysfunction are often carcinogenic. Recent advances in stem cell biology added the new concept that cancer originates from a single cancer-initiating cell. To understand the molecular basis of carcinogenesis from the beginning to the full acquirement of malignancy, factors concerned with carcinogenesis were categorized into three groups: those guarding and stabilizing genomes, those regulating cell proliferation, and those conferring resistance to various micro-environmental stresses. One example of particular interest is the Keap1-Nrf2 system since, according to recent studies, it has turned out to be ambivalent. Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf protein to strongly activate transcription through the Maf recognition element (MARE) and Keap1 is an inhibitory regulator of Nrf2. The genes regulated by Nrf2 are very important for cellular protection of the genome from xenobiotic and oxidative stresses and, consequently, for preventing carcinogenesis. This implies that enhancing Nrf2 activity is a promising method for thwarting cancer. On the contrary, the constitutive activation of Nrf2 due to mutations in the keap1 gene is characteristically observed in lung cancer cells, suggesting that induced expression of Nrf2 target genes favors the prevalence of cancer cells.",M2
16487043,"The heme-Bach1 pathway in the regulation of oxidative stress response and erythroid differentiation.Heme--as a prosthetic group of proteins required for oxygen transport and storage, respiration, and biosynthetic pathways--is essential for practically all forms of life. Additionally, the degradation products of heme (i.e., carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and bilirubin) produced by the enzymatic actions of heme oxygenase (HO) and biliverdin reductase, possess various biological activities in vivo. In mammalian cells, heme also functions as an intracellular regulator of gene expression by virtue of its ability to bind to Bach1, a transcription factor that functions in association with small <e>Maf</e> proteins. Normally, such complexes function as repressors by binding to specific target sequences, the Maf recognition element (MARE), within enhancers of genes encoding proteins such as HO-1 and beta-globin. By binding to Bach1, heme induces selective removal of the repressor from the gene enhancers permitting subsequent occupancy of the MAREs by activators that, interestingly, also contain small Maf proteins. Thus small Maf proteins play dual functions in gene expression: complexes with Bach1 repress MARE-dependent gene expression, whereas heterodimers with NF-E2 p45 or related factors (Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3) activate MARE-driven genes. By modulating the equilibrium of the small Maf heterodimer network, heme regulates expression of the cytoprotective enzyme HO-1 during the stress response and of beta-globin during erythroid differentiation. Implications of such heme-regulated gene expression in human diseases including atherosclerosis are discussed.",M2
16324151,"The superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 in the nucleus of human vascular endothelial cells.The superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase Nox4 was initially identified as an enzyme that is highly expressed in the kidney and is possibly involved in oxygen sensing and cellular senescence. Although the oxidase is also abundant in vascular endothelial cells, its role remains to be elucidated. Here we show that Nox4 preferentially localizes to the nucleus of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), by immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using three kinds of affinity-purified antibodies raised against distinct immunogens from human Nox4. Silencing of Nox4 by RNA interference (RNAi) abrogates nuclear signals given with the antibodies, confirming the nuclear localization of Nox4. The nuclear fraction of HUVECs exhibits an NAD(P)H-dependent superoxide-producing activity in a manner dependent on Nox4, which activity can be enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This stimulant also facilitates gene expression as estimated in the present transfection assay of HUVECs using a reporter regulated by the <e>Maf</e>-recognition element MARE, a DNA sequence that constitutes a part of oxidative stress response. Both basal and stimulated transcriptional activities are impaired by RNAi-mediated Nox4 silencing. Thus Nox4 appears to produce superoxide in the nucleus of HUVECs, thereby regulating gene expression via a mechanism for oxidative stress response.",M2
15972792,"The 5'-AT-rich half-site of <e>Maf</e> recognition element: a functional target for bZIP transcription factor Maf.The Maf family of proteins are a subgroup of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, which recognize a long palindromic DNA sequence [TGCTGAC(G)TCAGCA] known as the Maf recognition element (MARE). Interestingly, the functional target enhancer sequences present in the alphaA-crystallin gene contain a well-conserved half-site of MARE rather than the entire palindromic sequence. To resolve how Maf proteins bind to target sequences containing only MARE half-sites, we examined their binding activities using electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays as well as in vitro and in vivo reporter assays. Our results indicate that the 5'-flanking region of the MARE half-site is required for Maf proteins to bind both in vitro and in vivo. The critical 5'-flanking sequences for c-Maf were determined by a selection and amplification binding assay and show a preference for AT-rich nucleotides. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of several target genes also suggests that AT-rich sequences are important. We conclude that Maf can bind to at least two types of target sequences, the classical MARE (palindrome type) and a 5'-AT-rich MARE half-site (half-site type). Our results provide important new insights into the DNA binding and site selection by bZIP transcription factors.",M2
15921496,"FGF19-FGFR4 signaling elaborates lens induction with the FGF8-L-<e>Maf</e> cascade in the chick embryo.The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family is known to be involved in vertebrate eye development. However, distinct roles of individual FGF members during eye development remain largely elusive. Here, we show a detailed expression pattern of Fgf19 in chick lens development. Fgf19 expression initiated in the forebrain, and then became restricted to the distal portion of the optic vesicle abutting the future lens placode, where FGF receptor 4 (Fgfr4), a receptor for FGF19, was expressed. Fgf8, a positive regulator for L-Maf, was expressed in a portion of the optic vesicle. To examine the role of FGF19 signaling during early eye development, Fgf19 was misexpressed near the presumptive lens ectoderm; however, no alteration in the expression of lens marker genes was observed. Conversely, a secreted form of FGFR4 was misexpressed to inhibit an FGF19 signal, resulting in the induction of L-Maf expression. To further define the relationship between L-Maf and Fgf19, L-Maf misexpression was performed, resulting in ectopic induction of Fgf19 expression by Hamburger and Hamilton's stage 12/13. Furthermore, misexpression of Fgf8 induced Fgf19 expression in addition to L-Maf. These results suggest that FGF19-FGFR4 signaling plays a role in early lens development in collaboration with FGF8 signaling and L-Maf transcriptional system.",M2
15855760,"The involvement of neural retina pax6 in lens fiber differentiation.Proper eye formation depends on specific interactions between neural and ectodermal tissues coupled with temporally distinct gene expression and a regulated sequence of signaling events. The homeobox gene Pax6 is vitally important to the entire process of eye development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Pax6 expression for the retina anlage has been shown to be indispensable in the development of various retinal cells. Here, we report that Pax6 expression in neural tissue plays an important role in lens development. Expression of a dominant-negative version of Pax6 isoform that lacks 5a-exon sequence in developing optic vesicles (OV) of chick embryos led to arrest of lens development at the lens vesicle stage as well as optic cup deformation. To gain insights into the molecular events underlying deformed lens formation, we examined the expression of several transcription factors in the lens of Pax6-negative-OV eye. Importantly, L-<e>Maf</e> was downregulated while c-Maf was found normal in deformed lens. We detected a downregulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF8) in the neural tissue. Our in vivo experiments suggest that Pax6 in neural retina regulates FGF8 expression, which may maintain L-Maf expression in the lens to be essential for later lens fiber differentiation.",M2
15759153,"Phylogenomic analysis and expression patterns of large <e>Maf</e> genes in Xenopus tropicalis provide new insights into the functional evolution of the gene family in osteichthyans.We have performed an exhaustive characterization of the large Maf family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors in vertebrates using the genome data available, and studied the embryonic expression patterns of the four paralogous genes thus identified in Xenopus tropicalis. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that, in osteichthyans, the large Maf family contains four orthology classes, MafA, MafB, c-Maf and Nrl, which have emerged in vertebrates prior to the split between actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. It leads to the unambiguous assignment of the Xenopus laevis XLmaf gene, previously considered a MafA orthologue, to the Nrl class, the identification of the amphibian MafA and c-Maf orthologues and the identification of the zebrafish Nrl gene. The four X. tropicalis paralogues display partially redundant but nevertheless distinct expression patterns in the somites, developing hindbrain, pronephros, ventral blood island and lens. Comparisons with the data available in the mouse, chick and zebrafish show that these large Maf expression territories are highly conserved among osteichthyans but also highlight a number of differences in the timing of large Maf gene expression, the precise extent of some labelled territories and the combinations of paralogues transcribed in some organs. In particular, the availability of robust phylogenies leads to a reinterpretation of previous expression pattern comparisons, suggesting an important part for function shuffling within the gene family in the developing lens. These data highlight the importance of exhaustive characterizations of gene families for comparative analyses of the genetic mechanisms, which control developmental processes in vertebrates.",M2
15261825,"Temporal expression of L-<e>Maf</e> and RaxL in developing chicken retina are arranged into mosaic pattern.Members of the maf gene family encode basic/leucine zipper transcription factors and play important roles during cell differentiation in vertebrate and Drosophila development. To investigate the possible roles of chicken lens-specific Maf (L-Maf)/MafA in retinal development, we analyzed its expression in the developing chicken retina. We first determined that L-Maf is expressed in a subset of ganglion cells, amacrine cells and rod cells during retinal development. To characterize further the L-Maf expressing cells during photoreceptor development, we compared the expression patterns of L-Maf and RaxL, a marker of cone cells. We found the L-Maf proteins are detectable from E10 between RaxL positive cone cells in outer nuclear layer (ONL). Subsequently, the expression of L-Maf is restricted to the innermost nuclear cells in the ONL during rod differentiation. In contrast, RaxL positive cone cells are distributed in the outermost layer of ONL. Furthermore, tangential retinal sections showed that L-Maf positive rods and RaxL positive cones form a mosaic pattern during photoreceptor development.",M2
12676323,"Cooperative action between L-<e>Maf</e> and Sox2 on delta-crystallin gene expression during chick lens development.Lens development is regulated by a variety of transcription factors with distinct properties. The lens-specific transcription factor, L-Maf, is essential for lens formation and induces lens-specific markers, such as the crystallin genes. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which L-Maf regulates delta-crystallin expression. Misexpression of L-Maf in the head ectoderm of lens placode-forming embryos by in ovo electroporation induced delta-crystallin only in the region surrounding the lens. To define this restricted expression, we misexpressed L-Maf together with other transcription factors implicated in delta-crystallin expression. Sox2 plus L-Maf expanded the delta-crystallin-inducible domain to the entire head ectoderm and simultaneously increased the quantity of delta-crystallin mRNA expressed. In contrast, co-expression of L-Maf with other factors such as Pax6, Six3 and Prox1 had little or no effect on delta-crystallin. We also observed that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively enhanced the transactivation of a reporter gene bearing the delta-crystallin enhancer in ovo, implying that L-Maf and Sox2 can induce delta-crystallin through the same enhancer. In conclusion, we report here that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively regulate the expression of delta-crystallin during chick lens development.",M2
12128206,"L-<e>Maf</e>, a downstream target of Pax6, is essential for chick lens development.During lens development in vertebrates, the orchestration of multiple transcriptional regulators is essential for fate determination and terminal differentiation. In early development, Pax6, Sox2 and Six3 are expressed in the head ectoderm, while L-maf, Prox1 and crystallin genes are expressed at a later stage in the lens placode in a more restricted fashion. To uncover the genetic interactions among these factors during lens development, we examined the effects of dominant-negative molecules of Pax6 and L-Maf, which play decisive roles in lens formation. The two dominant-negative isoforms of Pax6 repress L-maf, Prox1 and delta-crystallin expression, resulting in failure of lens formation. These effects of dominant-negative Pax6 are fully rescued by co-expression with wild-type L-Maf. In addition, dominant-negative L-Maf inhibits the expression of Prox1 and delta-crystallin, while misexpression of L-Maf causes ectopic induction of these genes in a Sox-2-dependent fashion. Our results demonstrate that L-Maf is a downstream target of Pax6 and mediates Pax6 activity in developing lens cells.",M2
11842109,"c-<e>Maf</e>, the gammaD-crystallin Maf-responsive element and growth factor regulation.The transcription factor c-Maf has been suggested to regulate the activity of gamma-crystallin promoters in lens fibre cells. We here show that the transactivation potential of c-Maf and MafB for the rat gammaD-crystallin Maf-responsive element (gammaD MARE) is dependent upon the cellular context and, using chimeric and single domain mutants, that c-Maf is most likely to be the cognate factor for the gammaD MARE in the lens. Transactivation of the gammaD MARE by c-Maf in lens cells was not enhanced by c-Fos or c-Jun and was not blocked by dominant negative c-Fos or c-Jun constructs. c-Maf can activate the gammaD MARE as a homodimer since activation of the gammaD-crystallin promoter in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells required only c-Maf, but none of a number of c-Fos and c-Jun family members tested. Transactivation by c-Maf was inhibited by activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (by signal transduction agonist forskolin) or of protein kinase C (PKC) (by signal transduction agonist tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that this effect is not mediated by phosphorylation of the consensus PKA/PKC site in the extended DNA-binding domain, but likely involves activation of MAP kinase kinase, as inhibition by PD98059 increased transactivation by c-Maf.",M2

10842056,"Multiple functions of fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8) in chick eye development.Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8) is an important signaling molecule in the generation and patterning of the midbrain, tooth, and limb. In this study we show that it is also involved in eye development. In the chick, Fgf-8 transcripts first appear in the distal optic vesicle when it contacts the head ectoderm. Subsequently Fgf-8 expression increases and becomes localized to the central area of the presumptive neural retina (NR) only. Application of FGF-8 has two main effects on the eye. First, it converts presumptive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) into NR. This is apparent by the failure to express Bmp-7 and Mitf (a marker gene for the RPE) in the outer layer of the optic cup, coupled with the induction of NR genes, such as Rx, Sgx-1 and Fgf-8 itself. The induced retina displays the typical multilayered cytoarchitecture and expresses late neuronal differentiation markers such as synaptotagmin and islet-1. The second effect of FGF-8 exposure is the induction of both lens formation and lens fiber differentiation. This is apparent by the expression of a lens specific marker, L-<e>Maf</e>, and by morphological changes of lens cells. These results suggest that FGF-8 plays a role in the initiation and differentiation of neural retina and lens.",M2

A gene encoding an alphaCE2-binding protein, L-maf(lens-specific maf), was isolated. L-maf expression is initiated in the lens placode and is restricted to lens cells. The gene product L-Maf regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in the lens, and ectopic expression of this transcription factor converts chick embryonic ectodermal cells and cultured cells into lens fibers. Thus, vertebrate lens induction and differentiation can be triggered by the activation of L-Maf.",M2
9528779,"Lens-specific gene recruitment of zeta-crystallin through Pax6, Nrl-<e>Maf</e>, and brain suppressor sites.Zeta-Crystallin is a taxon-specific crystallin, an enzyme which has undergone direct gene recruitment as a structural component of the guinea pig lens through a Pax6-dependent mechanism. Tissue specificity arises through a combination of effects involving three sites in the lens promoter. The Pax6 site (ZPE) itself shows specificity for an isoform of Pax6 preferentially expressed in lens cells. High-level expression of the promoter requires a second site, identical to an alphaCE2 site or half Maf response element (MARE), adjacent to the Pax6 site. A promoter fragment containing Pax6 and MARE sites gives lens-preferred induction of a heterologous promoter. Complexes binding the MARE in lens nuclear extracts are antigenically related to Nrl, and cotransfection with Nrl elevates zeta-crystallin promoter activity in lens cells. A truncated zeta promoter containing Nrl-MARE and Pax6 sites has a high level of expression in lens cells in transgenic mice but is also active in the brain. Suppression of the promoter in the brain requires sequences between -498 and -385, and a site in this region forms specific complexes in brain extract. A three-level model for lens-specific Pax6-dependent expression and gene recruitment is suggested: (i) binding of a specific isoform of Pax6; (ii) augmentation of expression through binding of Nrl or a related factor; and (iii) suppression of promoter activity in the central nervous system by an upstream negative element in the brain but not in the lens.",M2
