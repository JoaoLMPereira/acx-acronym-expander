20417344,"The risk of cardiovascular events during leisure time activities at altitude.Annually, more than 100 million tourists are attracted by the mountainous areas around the world. On the one hand, leisure time activities at altitude may well contribute to the well-established beneficial effects of exercise; on the other hand, these activities are also associated with a relatively high risk of death. Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is the most frequent cause of nontraumatic death in males older than 34 years at altitude during leisure time activities such as downhill skiing and hiking. Whereas prior myocardial infarction is the most important risk factor for SCD, particularly relevant in downhill skiers, the unusual physical activity during the first days at altitude and the prolonged abstinence from food and fluid intake during exercise at altitude are the most important triggers. Unaccustomed physical activity seems more likely to trigger SCD than altitude per se. The detection of subjects at risk, evidence-based therapy, and advice on adequate behavior during the altitude sojourn will help to prevent SCD and to increase the health benefits generated by mountaineering activities.",M1
20384763,"Too long or too short? New insights into abnormal cardiac repolarization in people with chronic epilepsy and its potential role in sudden unexpected death.SUMMARY: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is probably caused by periictal cardiorespiratory alterations such as central apnea, bradyarrhythmia, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These alterations may occur in people with epilepsy and vary in duration and severity. Seizure-related ventricular tachyarrhythmias have also been hypothesized to be involved in SUDEP, but compelling evidence of these, or of predisposition to these, is lacking. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are facilitated by pathologic cardiac repolarization. Electrocardiography (ECG) indicators of pathologic cardiac repolarization, such as prolongation or shortening of QT intervals as well as increased QT dispersion, are established risk factors for life-threatening tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SDC). Abnormalities in cardiac repolarization have recently been described in people with epilepsy. Importantly, periictal ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation have also been reported in the absence of any underlying cardiac disease. Therefore, pathologic cardiac repolarization could promote <e>SCD</e> in people with epilepsy and could be one plausible cause for SUDEP. Herein, we review abnormal cardiac repolarization in people with epilepsy, describe the putative contribution of antiepileptic drugs, and discuss the potential role of pathologic cardiac repolarization in SUDEP. Based on these, measures to reduce the risk of or prevent SUDEP may include antiarrhythmic medication and implantation of cardiac combined pacemaker-defibrillator devices.",M1
20375931,"Sudden cardiac death in a 20-year-old male swimmer.In young adults, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is an acknowledged risk factor for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in an otherwise healthy and active patient. While the incidence of SCD in young people is not high enough for extensive, wide-scale examinations, the potential for prevention of some deaths via pre-exercise imaging may be beneficial in certain patient populations, such as those with a family history of SCD or professional athletes. We present the case of a healthy 20-year-old man with no past medical history who died while swimming in a river, likely secondary to cardiac arrest in the setting of HOCM.",M1
20362726,"Predictors for short-term progressive heart failure death in New York Heart Association II patients implanted with a cardioverter defibrillator--the EVADEF study.BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is the predominant cause of mortality in patients with mild heart failure (HF). This 2-year follow-up, multicenter, cohort study aimed to assess the extent to which implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), by reducing SCD, lead to predominant progressive HF death in mildly symptomatic HF patients at baseline in daily medical practice. METHODS: Between June 2001 and June 2003, 1,030 New York Heart Association II patients received an ICD in 22 French centers. Sudden cardiac death and progressive HF mortality rates were assessed using competing risk methodology, and predictors for progressive HF at baseline were tested in a multivariate regression model. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22 +/- 6 months, 114 deaths occurred: 12 (10.5%) due to SCD and 52 (45.6%) due to progressive HF (24-month cause-specific mortality rates of 1.2% [95% CI 0.6-1.9] and 5.4% [95% CI 4.0-6.8], respectively). Diuretics use (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.5, P = .002), history of atrial fibrillation (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.2-3.65, P = .01), and low ejection fraction (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-4.8, P = .0008) were independent predictors for progressive HF death, whereas beta-blocker therapy was a protector (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, P = .04). Half of the patients (48%) who died from progressive HF within 2 years of ICD implant initially presented with enlarged QRS (&gt; or =120 milliseconds). CONCLUSIONS: Because of ICD efficiency, progressive HF is the main cause of death within 2 years of implant, although these patients are only mildly symptomatic at implantation. In addition to optimal pharmacologic therapy, these results raise the question of systematically implanting ICDs with cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with electrical asynchronism at baseline.",M1
20233980,"Cystatin C and sudden cardiac death risk in the elderly.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated an association between moderate kidney dysfunction and sudden cardiac death in people with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was a longitudinal analysis among 4465 participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cystatin C and creatinine were measured from baseline sera. Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) was defined as a sudden pulseless condition from a cardiac origin in a previously stable individual that occurred out of the hospital or in the emergency room. The association between cystatin C tertiles and SCD was determined with multivariate Cox proportional hazards. A similar analysis compared SCD incidence across creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) tertiles. Over a median follow-up of 11.2 years, 91 adjudicated SCD events occurred. The annual incidence of SCD events increased across cystatin C tertiles: 10 events per 10 000 person years in tertile 1, 25 events per 10 000 person years in tertile 2, and 32 events per 10 000 person-years in the highest cystatin C tertile. These associations persisted after multivariate adjustment: hazards ratio=2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 5.16 in tertile 2 and hazards ratio=2.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 5.35 in tertile 3. After multivariate adjustment, the rate of SCD also increased in a linear distribution across creatinine-based eGFR tertiles: 15 events per 10 000 person-years in tertile 1, 22 events per 10 000 person-years in tertile 2, and 27 events per 10 000 person-years in tertile 3. No significant associations, however, remained between creatinine-based eGFR and SCD after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired kidney function, as measured by cystatin C, has an independent association with SCD risk among elderly persons without clinical cardiovascular disease.",M1
20212277,"Modeled economic evaluation of alternative strategies to reduce sudden cardiac death among children treated for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.BACKGROUND: Stimulants are widely used to treat children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and may increase the risk for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). We examined the cost-effectiveness of pretreatment screening with ECG for reducing SCD risk in children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder who are candidates for stimulant medication. Method and Results- We constructed a state-transition Markov model with 10 annual cycles spanning 7 to 17 years of age. Taking a societal perspective, we compared the cost-effectiveness of 3 screening strategies: (1) performing a history and physical examination with cardiology referral if abnormal (current standard of care); (2) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG after negative history and physical examination, with cardiology referral if either is abnormal; and (3) performing a history and physical examination plus ECG, with cardiology referral only if ECG is abnormal. Children identified with SCD-associated cardiac abnormalities would be restricted from stimulants and from playing competitive sports. The expected incremental cost-effectiveness over strategy 1 was $39,300 and $27,200 per quality-adjusted life-year for strategies 2 and 3, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation found that the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness was 55% for strategy 2 and 71% for strategy 3 (willingness to pay &lt; or =$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Both strategies 2 and 3 would avert 13 SCDs per 400,000 children seeking stimulant treatment for ADHD, for a cost of $1.6 million per life for strategy 2 and $1.2 million per life for strategy 3. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to current practice, adding ECG screening to history and physical examination pretreatment screening for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has borderline cost-effectiveness for preventing SCD. Relative cost-effectiveness may be improved by basing cardiology referral on ECG alone. Benefits of ECG screening arise primarily by restricting children identified with SCD risk from competitive sports.",M1
20210726,"QT alterations in psychopharmacology: proven candidates and suspects.Psychotropics are among the most common causes of drug induced acquired long QT syndrome. Blockage of Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel by psychoactive drugs appears to be related to this adverse effect. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol, thioridazine, sertindole, pimozide, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, trazadone, fluoxetine depress the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) in a dose dependent manner in experimental models. The frequency of QTc prolongation (more than 456 ms) in psychiatric patients is estimated to be 8%. Age over 65 years, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), thioridazine, droperidol, olanzapine, and higher antipsychotic doses were predictors of significant QTc prolongation. In large epidemiological controlled studies a dose dependent increased risk of sudden death has been identified in current users of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical) and of TCA. Thioridazine and haloperidol shared a similar relative risk of <e>SCD</e>. Lower doses of risperidone had a higher relative risk than haloperidol for cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmia. No increased risk was identified in current users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Cases of TdP have been reported with thioridazine, haloperidol, ziprazidone, olanzapine and TCA. Evidence of QTc prolongation with sertindole is significant and this drug has not been approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). A large trial is ongoing to evaluate the cardiac risk profile of ziprazidone and olanzapine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been associated with QTc prolongation but no cases of TdP have been reported with the use of these agents. There are no reported cases of lithium induced TdP. Risk factors for drug induced LQT syndrome and TdP include: female gender, concomitant cardiovascular disease, substance abuse, drug interactions, bradychardia, electrolyte disorders, anorexia nervosa, and congenital Long QT syndrome. Careful selection of the psychotropic and identification of patient's risk factors for QTc prolongation is applicable in current clinical practice.",M1
20196976,"N-3 fatty acids and cardiac autonomic function in humans.Studies suggest that marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) offer some protection against sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). The autonomic nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of SCD and due to the fact that n-3 PUFA is abundant in the brain and other nervous tissue it is likely that n-3 PUFA might modulate autonomic control of the heart. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive marker of cardiac autonomic function and an attenuated HRV is a predictor for SCD and arrhythmic events. Studies on HRV and n-3 PUFA have been performed in several populations such as patients with ischaemic heart disease, patients with diabetes mellitus, patients with chronic renal failure, and in healthy subjects. Many studies have demonstrated a positive association between cellular content of n-3 PUFA and HRV as well as supplementation with n-3 PUFA seems to increase HRV and thereby decreasing the risk of arrhythmic events and SCD.",M1
20185000,"Relation of body mass index to sudden cardiac death and the benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after healing of myocardial infarction.Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and heart failure. However, data regarding the relation of body mass index (BMI) to outcome in patients with established heart failure are conflicting. We examined the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in 1,231 patients after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction enrolled the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-II (MADIT-II). Interaction-term analysis was used to assess the benefit of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in upper (obese &gt; or =30 kg/m(2), n = 361) and lower (nonobese &lt;30 kg/m(2), n = 870) BMI categories. Mean BMI in the study population was 27.9 +/- 5.1 kg/m(2). In multivariate analysis, decreased BMI was shown to be independently associated with an increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (23% risk increase per 5-U BMI decreased, p = 0.009) and SCD (41% risk increase per 5-U BMI decrease, p = 0.01). Consistently, patients with BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2) exhibited 46% (p = 0.03) and 76% (p = 0.04) increases in risk of all-cause mortality and SCD, respectively, compared to patients who had higher BMI values. The benefit of the ICD was pronounced in higher-risk patients with BMI &lt;30 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio 0.68, p = 0.017) and maintained in the lower-risk subgroup of patients with BMI &gt; or =30 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio 0.73, p = 0.32; p = 0.86 for ICD-by-BMI interaction). In conclusion, our findings suggest an independent inverse association between BMI values and risk of all-cause mortality and SCD in patients after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction enrolled in the MADIT-II trial.",M1
20142817,"Sudden cardiac death: epidemiology and risk factors.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is an important public-health problem with multiple etiologies, risk factors, and changing temporal trends. Substantial progress has been made over the past few decades in identifying markers that confer increased SCD risk at the population level. However, the quest for predicting the high-risk individual who could be a candidate for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or other therapy, continues. In this article, we review the incidence, temporal trends, and triggers of SCD, and its demographic, clinical, and genetic risk factors. We also discuss the available evidence supporting the use of public-access defibrillators.",M1
20089485,"Selective implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators in patients with genetic heart disease and sudden death risk.The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is an established intervention for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction. Multiple randomized clinical trials have studied the use of ICD for the primary and secondary SCD. These studies were performed in patients with left ventricular dysfunction from coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy, and the marker of reduced ejection fraction has emerged for selecting patients who would benefit from ICD therapy. Currently, for most of these patients the decision to implant, or not, is determined by relatively straightforward paradigms. The same cannot be said for the genetic cardiac diseases associated with SCD--long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Indications for ICD in these conditions are very much a work-in-progress.",M1
20089483,"Sudden cardiac death in young competitive athletes due to genetic cardiac abnormalities.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders. While these events are relatively few compared to other cardiac deaths, they are tragic in that death occurs in a young, otherwise healthy person. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. As a result of growing awareness that these deaths can be prevented, guidelines have been issued in both Europe and the United States to help screen and determine qualification for young persons who want to participate in competitive athletics. There remains debate on the how extensive screening should be, in particular over the use of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), with European guidelines mandating ECG and United States guidelines not recommending routine use of the ECG.",M1
20118111,"Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: systematic review of clinical risk markers.We performed a systematic literature review of recommended 'major' and 'possible' clinical risk markers for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We searched the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases for articles published between 1971 and 2007. We included English language reports on HCM patients containing follow-up data on the endpoint (sudden) cardiac death using survival analysis. Analysis was undertaken using the quality of reporting of meta-analyses (QUORUM) statement checklist. The quality was checked using a quality assessment form from the Cochrane Collaboration. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria and passed quality assessment. The use of the six major risk factors (previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, extreme left ventricular hypertrophy, unexplained syncope, abnormal blood pressure response, and family history of sudden death) in risk stratification for SCD as recommended by international guidelines was supported by the literature. In addition, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seems associated with a higher risk of SCD. Our systematic review provides sound evidence for the use of the six major risk factors for SCD in the risk stratification of HCM patients. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction could be included in the overall risk profile of patients with a marked left ventricular outflow gradient under basal conditions.",M1
20104451,"Pathophysiology, risk stratification, and management of sudden cardiac death in coronary artery disease.Management of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is undergoing radical change in direction. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that besides depressed left ventricular systolic function and the conventional risk stratification tools, new markers for plaque vulnerability, enhanced thrombogenesis, specific genetic alterations of the autonomic nervous system, cardiac sarcolemmal and contractile proteins, and familial clustering may better segregate patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) who are at high risk of SCD from those who may suffer from nonfatal ischemic events. Better understanding of pathophysiologic processes such as post-myocardial infarction remodeling, the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure, and the increased cardiovascular risk of CAD in the presence of diabetes or even a pre-diabetic state will help to improve both risk stratification and management. The rapidly developing fields of microchips technology, and proteomics may allow rapid and cost-effective mass screening of multiple risk factors for SCD. The ultimate goal is not only to change the current direction of management strategy of SCD away from increased ICD utilization, but to identify novel methods for risk stratification, risk modification, and prevention of SCD that could be applied to the general public at large.",M1
20102864,"Etiology of sudden death in the community: results of anatomical, metabolic, and genetic evaluation.BACKGROUND: Identifying persons at risk for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is challenging. A comprehensive evaluation may reveal clues about the clinical, anatomical, genetic, and metabolic risk factors for SCD. METHODS: Seventy-one patients who had SCD (25-60 years old) without an initially apparent cause of death were evaluated at the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office (Minneapolis, MN) from August 2001 to July 2004. We reviewed their clinic records conducted next-of-kin interviews and performed autopsy, laboratory testing, and genetic analysis for mutations in genes associated with the long QT syndrome. RESULTS: Mean age was 49.5 +/- 7 years, 86% were male, and 2 subjects had history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Coronary risk factors were highly prevalent in comparison to individuals of the same age group in this community (eg, smoking 61%, hypertension 27%, hyperlipidemia 25%) but inadequately treated. On autopsy, 80% of the subjects had high-grade coronary stenoses. Acute coronary lesions and previous silent myocardial infarction (MI) were found in 27% and 34%, respectively. Furthermore, 32% of the subjects had recently smoked cigarettes, and 50% had ingested analgesics. Possible deleterious mutations of the ion channel genes were detected in 5 subjects (7%). Of these, 4 were in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the persons who had SCD in the community had severe subclinical CHD, including undetected previous MI. Traditional coronary risk factors were prevalent and undertreated. Mutations in the long QT syndrome genes were detected in a few subjects. These findings imply that improvements in the detection and treatment of subclinical CHD in the community are needed to prevent SCD.",M1
20091252,"[Limits and scopes of invasive risk stratification. Do we still need programmed ventricular stimulation?]Patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ICM), dilated (DCM), hypertrophic (HCM), or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) carry a high risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are most often the cause of SCD, which can be treated with internal cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). However, a great proportion of these high-risk patients will never experience potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and as such will never be in need of these devices. Given the risks, inconvenience, and costs of ICDs, markers that adequately stratify patients according to their risk of SCD are needed. Programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) has long been used to identify the patients' risk of SCD. However, the prognostic ability of PVS is only modest and the negative predictive value is poor. As far as patients with ICM are concerned, recent data from the MUSTT and MADIT II trials demonstrate that in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 30% and 40%, inducibility by PVS can help to identify patients who are at particularly increased risk of SCD. The value of PVS in patients with DCM, HCM, and ARVCM for risk stratification of SCD is less clear and the available data even more limited. In these patients, the inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias does not clearly correlate with VT/VF (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation) risk, and more importantly, noninducibility does not portend good prognosis. The current German guidelines appreciate these uncertainties of PVS for risk stratification with class IIb recommendations in certain patients with ICM, HCM or ARVCM. In the future, combining the results of invasive PVS with other noninvasive parameters may improve its prognostic value. Furthermore, expanding the role of PVS to guiding therapeutic ablation of ventricular arrhythmias may influence patient's future risk of SCD.",M1
20091251,"Risk stratification in electrical cardiomyopathies.Electrical cardiomyopathies contain the long QT syndrome (LQTS), the short QT syndrome (SQTS), the Brugada syndrome, and the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). Usually, we are dealing with young patients or even children. The prevalence of these diseases is low. No large prospective randomized studies exist with respect to outcome based on different clinical and genetic parameters. Thus, risk stratification in these patients is based on retrospective data from single- or multicenter registries.The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is the only reliable therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome and SQTS, as no pharmacological therapy has been proven to prevent SCD. In LQTS and CPVT, the primary therapy relies on beta-blockers. In high-risk patients, the ICD is indicated.In all electrical diseases, risk stratification is based on the clinical phenotype, including the electrocardiogram, the history of unexplained or disease-related syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest. In LQTS and CPVT, demographic data like age and gender are important factors for risk stratification. The genotype contributes to risk stratification only in LQTS and CPVT.Patients with electrical cardiomyopathies have to be risk-stratified individually based on the data and the current guidelines available.",M1
20056593,"Structured care for patients after acute myocardial infarction: sudden cardiac death prevention--data from the Leiden MISSION! AMI study.AIMS: To assess the number of patients in daily clinical practice that meets criteria for implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) when treated according to an aggressive treatment protocol. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were treated according to the MISSION! protocol. The protocol encompasses pre-hospital, in-hospital, and outpatient clinical framework for the acute and chronic treatment of AMI patients and the decision making regarding primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). A total of 676 consecutive AMI patients (78% male, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) treated according to the MISSION! protocol were included in this analysis. Left ventricular ejection fraction at 3 months was 54 +/- 10%. Only 39 (6%) patients met criteria for implantation of an ICD &lt;1 year post-MI. These patients suffered more extensive infarctions as indicated by higher peak troponin T values (mean 14.5 +/- 8.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 14.7 microg/L; P &lt; 0.001) and had more left anterior descending artery related infarctions (79 vs. 46%; P &lt; 0.001). Cumulative first appropriate therapy rate was 15% at 3 years follow-up. No SCD was observed in the study population. CONCLUSION: Aggressive treatment of AMI patients and close monitoring after the index event according to a standardized protocol, results in only a small number of patients becoming candidate for prophylactic ICD implantation. An easy-to-use protocol combining aggressive reperfusion, optimal medication, and a risk stratification algorithm tailored to fit within routine practice may help to maintain ICD implantation rates within manageable proportions.",M1
20047134,"Molecular autopsy in sudden cardiac death and its implication for families: discussion of the practical, legal and ethical aspects of the multidisciplinary collaboration.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is a major cause of premature death in young adults and children in developed countries. Standard forensic autopsy procedures are often unsuccessful in determining the cause of SCD. Post-mortem genetic testing, also called molecular autopsy, has revealed that a non-negligible number of these deaths are a result of inherited cardiac diseases, including arrhythmic disorders such as congenital long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. Due to the heritability of these diseases, the potential implications for living relatives must be taken into consideration. Advanced diagnostic analyses, genetic counselling, and interdisciplinary collaboration should be integral parts of clinical and forensic practice. In this article we present a multidisciplinary collaboration established in Lausanne, with the goal of properly informing families of these pathologies and their implications for surviving family members. In Switzerland, as in many other countries, legal guidelines for genetic testing do not address the use of molecular tools for post-mortem genetic analyses in forensic practice. In this article we present the standard practice guidelines established by our multidisciplinary team.",M1

We analyzed rate and structure of SD among persons who had succumbed in 2005-2007 in several districts of Moscow with population of 2,502,836. Of the total number of 19,557 autopsies 7702 (39.4% or 92/100 000/year) and 1265 (6.5%, 19.4% of autopsies in this age group, or 16.8/100000/year) in all age groups and in the age 1-45 years, respectively, were performed because of SCD. In most cases (44%) age at SCD was 41-45 years, only in 1% of cases it was less than 18 years. Eighty two percent of autopsied SD victims were men. Most frequent postmortem diagnosis was  cardiomyopathy  (69% overall, 80-96% in the age 19-35 years) established on the basis of detection of both specific and nonspecific changes in the myocardium. In 25% of SD cases in the age group before 18 years congenital heart disease was found. After 35 years rose portion of diseases of ischemic nature (22-32%). Percentages of hypertensive disease and other diseases among all diagnoses were 7 and 1, respectively. Beginning with 19 years in large percentage of cases presence of alcohol in blood was detected. This percentage was especially high in the age group 19-25 years (66.6%). SCD of most persons aged 20-45 years was registered at home, while in 50% of younger persons it occurred outside home often during physical effort. Rate of SCD, its circumstances and structure elicited in this study might serve as basis for elaboration of the system of early detection of groups of risk and prevention of SD in young age.",M1
19963853,"Medium voltage therapy for preventing and treating asystole and PEA in ICDs.INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) takes up to 500,000 lives each year before a victim can even be treated. To address this the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was developed to treat those identified at high risk of SCD. Unfortunately, there are a significant number of cases in which the ICD does not successfully return a victim to normal rhythm and effective perfusion of the blood. METHODS: The vast majority of cases that are not responsive to the ICD therapy require cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) according to current resuscitation guidelines. A novel electrical stimulus called medium voltage therapy (MVT) has shown efficacy in producing coronary and carotid blood flow during ventricular fibrillation. This report presents the case that the same stimulus may be effective and feasible for use in ICD patients that do not respond to their ICD therapy, or do not have a rhythm in which, an ICD shock is indicated. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of MVT technology in implantable devices may be effective in preparing the heart for successful defibrillation or in improving the metabolic condition of the heart to the extent that a pulsatile rhythm may spontaneously develop.",M1

Based on the subsequent experiments on three volunteers in daily activity situation, the preliminary results indicate three-channel ECGs of each volunteer and his localization information can be real-timely and continuously monitored in the center.",M1
19962483,"Relation of 12-lead electrocardiogram patterns to implanted defibrillator-terminated ventricular tachyarrhythmias in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities are common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) and have been associated with the distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Such abnormalities may predispose patients to electrophysiologic instability, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). We studied 330 patients with HC who were judged clinically to be at high risk for SCD and therefore received automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Surface 12-lead electrocardiograms acquired at the time of ICD implantation were analyzed and the ECG characteristics of patients with appropriate device interventions for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were compared to those patients without appropriate device interventions. The 330 patients were followed for 3.7 +/- 3.0 years after implantation and 57 patients (17%) had appropriate discharges. No differences in the ECG characteristics of patients with and without appropriate device interventions were identified. Markedly increased ECG voltages, QRS duration, left or rightward QRS axis, abnormal Q waves, and QTc or QT dispersion were not associated with appropriate ICD discharge. Conversely, normal electrocardiograms and electrocardiograms normal except for a repolarization abnormality in only 1 anatomic distribution were not associated with freedom from ICD discharge. Moreover, no combination of ECG variables was associated with the likelihood of an appropriate ICD discharge. In conclusion, in a cohort of patients with HC selected because of their high risk for SCD, 12-lead surface electrocardiogram did not predict subsequent appropriate ICD intervention for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and was not useful in risk stratification for sudden death.",M1

We sought to develop a tool to improve the risk stratification of patients with coronary artery disease. Clinical, demographic, and angiographic characteristics were evaluated among 37,258 patients who had undergone coronary angiography from January 1, 1985 to May 31, 2005, and who were found to have at least one native coronary artery stenosis of &gt; or =75%. After a median follow-up of 6.2 years, SCD had occurred in 1,568 patients, 14,078 patients had died from other causes, and 21,612 patients remained alive. A Cox proportional hazards model identified 10 independent patient characteristic variables significantly associated with SCD. A simplified model accounting for 97% of the predictive capacity of the full model included the following 7 variables: depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, number of diseased coronary arteries, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and tobacco use. The Duke SCD risk score was created from the simplified model to predict the likelihood of SCD among patients with coronary artery disease. It was internally validated with bootstrapping (c-index = 0.75, chi-square = 1,220.8) and externally validated in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy from the Sudden Cardiac Death Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) database (c-index = 0.64, chi-square = 14.1). In conclusion, the Duke SCD risk score represents a simple, validated method for predicting the risk of SCD among patients with coronary artery disease and might be useful for directing treatment strategies designed to mitigate the risk of SCD.",M1
19948092,"Who should receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator after myocardial infarction?Despite a decline in overall cardiovascular mortality, the incidence of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) continues to rise. Patients who survive a myocardial infarction (MI) with depressed ejection fraction are at particularly high risk for SCD. The development of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has revolutionized SCD prevention; however, despite the current fervor for device implantation, many unresolved questions remain about risk stratification in post-MI patients. This review presents the current indications and timing of ICD implantation for primary and secondary prevention of SCD after MI. Several conventional and investigational methods of risk stratification after MI, as well as current controversies regarding device implantation in specific patient populations, are also reviewed.",M1
19942089,"Soluble ST2 for predicting sudden cardiac death in patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.OBJECTIVES: We studied whether the measurement of the soluble form of ST2 (sST2), an interleukin-1 receptor family member, could identify heart failure (HF) patients at risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). BACKGROUND: The prediction of SCD remains an important challenge in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic HF. Concentrations of sST2 have been found increased and related to worse long-term outcomes in patients with acute HF. Whether sST2 has a prognostic role in SCD is unknown. METHODS: A nested case-control study was performed on 36 cases of SCD and 63 control patients (matched for age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction) obtained from the MUSIC (MUerte Súbita en Insuficiencia Cardíaca) registry, a 3-year multicenter registry of ambulatory HF patients (New York Heart Association functional class II to III, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or =45%). Demographic, clinical, echocardiographic, electrical, and biochemical data were collected at enrollment. RESULTS: Concentrations of sST2 were greater among decedents (0.23 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.16 to 0.43 ng/ml] vs. 0.12 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.06 to 0.23 ng/ml], p = 0.001) and were predictive of experiencing SCD (+0.1 ng/ml, odds ratio: 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.78, p = 0.006). On the basis of a combined biomarker status, only 4% of patients experienced SCD for neither sST2 nor N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) above receiver-operator characteristic-derived cut-off points (0.15 ng/ml and 2,000 ng/l, respectively), 34% for either biomarker above, and 71% for both biomarkers above (p &lt; 0.001 for trend). This combined variable added incremental prognostic value to the multivariable regression model (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated sST2 concentrations are predictive of SCD in patients with chronic HF and provide complementary information to NT-proBNP levels. A combined biomarker approach may have an impact on clinical decision-making.",M1
19932795,"Frequency of cardiac death in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.The prognosis in children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is guarded, with the 5-year mortality rate ranging from 14% to 50%, owing to sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) or pump failure. The risk factors for SCD in adults with IDC include asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and poor left ventricular function. It is unclear whether these findings can be extrapolated to the pediatric population. A retrospective review of all patients with the diagnosis of IDC seen at a single institution from 1990 to 2004 was performed. A total of 85 patients (46 males), with a median age of 3.8 years (0 days to 17.3 years) were studied. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 +/- 12% (median 23%, range 45% to 45%) at presentation. The following arrhythmias occurred at presentation or during the initial hospitalization: nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 6, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in 1, supraventricular arrhythmias in 6, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. During a subsequent hospitalization or outpatient follow-up, 7 patients had the following arrhythmias: supraventricular arrhythmias in 2, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 4, and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in 1. The cumulative survival rate was 40% at a mean follow-up of 6.2 years (95% confidence interval 4.4 to 8.1). One single episode of SCD occurred in 1 patient without a history of sustained arrhythmias. In conclusion, in children with IDC, despite the low left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of ventricular arrhythmias, only one episode of SCD occurred in this group of patients. Given the 1% incidence of SCD in this cohort, the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators as primary prevention in children with IDC might not be indicated.",M1
19917887,"Impact of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, amiodarone, and placebo on the mode of death in stable patients with heart failure: analysis from the sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial.BACKGROUND: The Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (<e>SCD</e>-HeFT) demonstrated that implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduces all-cause mortality in patients with New York Heart Association class II/III heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or =35% on optimal medical therapy. Whether ICD therapy reduced sudden death caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias without affecting heart failure deaths in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: SCD-HeFT randomized 2521 subjects to placebo, amiodarone, or shock-only, single-lead ICD therapy. Over a median follow-up of 45.5 months, a total of 666 deaths occurred, which were reviewed by an Events Committee and initially categorized as cardiac or noncardiac. Cardiac deaths were further adjudicated as resulting from sudden death presumed to be ventricular tachyarrhythmic, bradyarrhythmia, heart failure, or other cardiac causes. ICD therapy significantly reduced cardiac mortality compared with placebo (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.95) and tachyarrhythmia mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.59) and had no impact on mortality resulting from heart failure or noncardiac causes. The cardiac and tachyarrhythmia mortality reductions were evident in subjects with New York Heart Association class II but not in subjects with class III heart failure. The reduction in tachyarrhythmia mortality with ICD therapy was similar in subjects with ischemic and nonischemic disease. Compared with placebo, amiodarone had no significant effect on any mode of death. CONCLUSIONS: ICD therapy reduced cardiac mortality and sudden death presumed to be ventricular tachyarrhythmic in SCD-HeFT and had no effect on heart failure mortality. Amiodarone had no effect on all-cause mortality or its cause-specific components, except an increase in non-cardiac mortality in class III patients.

The short-term HRV was analyzed during daytime and nighttime by means of RR series. An entropy rate was calculated on the RR series, previously transformed to symbol sequences by means of an alphabet. A statistical analysis permitted to stratify high- and low-risk patients of suffering SCD, with a specificity (SP) of 95% and sensitivity (SE) of 83.3%.",M1
19901189,"A common variant at 9p21 is associated with sudden and arrhythmic cardiac death.BACKGROUND: Although a heritable basis for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is suggested by the impact of family history on SCD risk, common genetic determinants have been difficult to identify. We hypothesized that a common variant at chromosome 9p21 related to myocardial infarction would influence SCD risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, nested, case-control analysis among individuals of European ancestry enrolled in 6 prospective cohort studies. Study subjects were followed up for development of SCD, and genotypes for rs10757274 were determined for 492 sudden and/or arrhythmic deaths and 1460 controls matched for age, sex, cohort, history of cardiovascular disease, and follow-up time. Conditional logistic regression with fixed-effects meta-analysis assuming an additive model was used to test for associations. When individual study results were combined in the meta-analysis, each increasing copy of the G allele at rs10757274 conferred a significantly elevated age-adjusted odds ratio for SCD of 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.40; P=0.01). Controlling for cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors strengthened these relationships (odds ratio, 1.29 per G-allele copy; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.53; P=0.003). These results were not materially altered in sensitivity analyses limited to definite SCD, in models that further controlled for the development of interim cardiovascular disease, or when the highly correlated variant rs2383207 was tested. CONCLUSIONS: The major allele of a single-nucleotide polymorphism previously associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease events is associated with increased risk of SCD in individuals of European ancestry. Study of the mechanism underlying this association may improve our understanding of lethal cardiovascular disease.",M1
19880071,"Common genetic variants in sudden cardiac death.Evidence from family history, twin studies and molecular studies of rare inherited arrhythmia predisposition syndromes indicate that genetic factors are important contributors to determining risk for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). More recent evidence indicates that common genetic variants in several genes can explain part of this risk at the population level. Here, the genetic risks for SCD are reviewed along with explanations of basic concepts relevant to understanding genetic contributions to common diseases. Also reviewed are two categories of genetic studies that have led to important discoveries about the genetic basis for SCD in general populations. Candidate gene studies focusing mainly on genes responsible for rare inherited arrhythmia susceptibility syndromes or on determinants of autonomic nervous system function will be highlighted first followed by more recent data from genome wide association studies that have identified previously unrecognized genomic intervals that explain inter-individual differences in QT interval duration possibly accounting for a proportion of the population-attributable risk for SCD.",M1
19887457,"The relationship between high resting heart rate and ventricular arrhythmogenesis in patients referred to ambulatory 24 h electrocardiographic recording.AIMS: High resting heart rate (HR) has been associated with sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). This association is not fully explained by the reported association between HR with coronary heart disease (CHD) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the major pathological substrates for SCD. Ventricular arrhythmia is the most common antecedent event before SCD. Examining associations between resting HR and ventricular arrhythmogenesis may enhance our understanding of the association between high resting HR and SCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 867 patients (age 54 +/- 5, 57% females) who underwent 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recording (Holter) in the period from 1998 to 2000. We examined the unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted associations between resting HR with factors involved in ventricular arrhythmogenesis [ventricular late potentials (LPs) detected by signal-averaged ECG, heart rate variability (HRV), and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs)]. Linear regression models were used for continuous outcomes and logistic regression analysis was used for categorical outcomes. The multivariable models included first age and sex, then history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, CHD, heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), smoking, body mass index, the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs, and ST-depression in the 24 h ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) were included in the final models. In the unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analysis, high resting HR was significantly associated with positive ventricular LPs, depressed HRV indices, and increased prevalence of PVCs/24 h independently from demographic and clinical variables including LVEF, history of CHD, and the presence of ST-depression in Holter (P-value &lt;0.05 in all comparisons and models). CONCLUSION: High resting HR is independently associated with ventricular arrhythmogenesis, the major cause of SCD. These findings could partially explain the reported association between increased HR and SCD.",M1
19881337,"Fragmented QRS and other depolarization abnormalities as a predictor of mortality and sudden cardiac death.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several invasive and noninvasive tests for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) have been studied. Tests such as microwave T wave alternans (repolarization abnormality) and signal-averaged ECG (depolarization abnormality) have high negative predictive values but low positive predictive values in patients with heart disease. The presence of a fragmented QRS (fQRS) complex on a routine 12-lead ECG is another marker of depolarization abnormality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the potential utility of tests to detect depolarization abnormalities of the heart for the risk stratification of mortality and SCD with main emphasis on fQRS. RECENT FINDINGS: fQRS is associated with increased mortality and arrhythmic events in patients with coronary artery disease. fQRS has also been defined as a marker of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and Brugada syndrome. In Brugada syndrome, the presence of fQRS predicts episodes of ventricular fibrillation during follow-up. SUMMARY: fQRS may be of value in determining the risk for SCD and guiding selection for device therapy in patients with structural heart disease and Brugada syndrome. It is possible that the predictive value of fQRS for SCD can be enhanced further by combining a marker of repolarization abnormality such as microwave T wave alternans.",M1
19875410,"Timing of eplerenone initiation and outcomes in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction: insights from the EPHESUS trial.AIMS: To test the hypothesis that an earlier post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) eplerenone initiation in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and heart failure (HF) is associated with better long-term outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 6632 patients of the EPHESUS study were randomized from day 3 to 14 after the index AMI (median = 7 days), of these 3319 were assigned to eplerenone. We analysed the differential effects of time-to-eplerenone initiation vs. placebo, based on the median time to initiation of treatment (&lt;7 days-'earlier', &gt; or =7days-'later'). Effects on outcomes were evaluated over a mean 16-month follow-up, using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The earlier eplerenone initiation (&lt;7 days) reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 31% (P = 0.001) when compared with the 'earlier' placebo' and also reduced the risks of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization/CV mortality by 24% (P &lt; 0.0001) and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) by 34% (P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, later eplerenone initiation (&gt; or =7 days) had no significant effect on outcomes. Interactions between time-to-randomization and treatment were significant. These associations remained substantially unchanged after risk adjustment in multivariable models. CONCLUSION: An earlier eplerenone administration (3-7days) post-AMI improved outcomes in patients with LVSD and HF. This benefit was not observed when eplerenone was initiated later (&gt; or =7days).",M1
19875406,"Sleep apnoea induces cardiac electrical instability assessed by T-wave alternans in patients with congestive heart failure.AIMS: To assess the involvement of sleep apnoea in nocturnal sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) by evaluating cardiac electrical instability using T-wave alternans (TWA), a risk marker for lethal cardiac arrhythmias, and severity of sleep apnoea in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 40 CHF patients simultaneously underwent overnight simplified respiratory polygraphy and 24 h continuous electrocardiography. Peak TWA during both daytime and nighttime were calculated by the modified moving average method. The patients were divided into two groups; 30 patients with daytime predominant TWA (whose peak TWA was higher during daytime than during nighttime) and 10 with nighttime predominant. Apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was significantly higher in patients with nighttime predominant TWA than in those with daytime predominant (35.9 +/- 8.1 vs. 23.9 +/- 14.4 events/h, P = 0.02), and was an independent predictor of nighttime predominant TWA (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.16; P = 0.03). Moreover, peak TWA during the night was correlated positively with AHI (P &lt; 0.001), and AHI was an independent determinant of nocturnal TWA value (r(2) = 0.27, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: In CHF patients, sleep apnoea induces cardiac electrical instability manifested as TWA, reflecting increased risk of nocturnal SCD. Moreover, some CHF patients with sleep apnoea exhibit nighttime predominant TWA. Therefore, TWA should also be evaluated during the night.",M1
19853694,"Intake of total trans, trans-18:1, and trans-18:2 fatty acids and risk of sudden cardiac death in women.BACKGROUND: Total intake of trans fat is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), and recent reports in primarily male populations suggest that blood levels of specific trans isomers may have different effects on risk, particularly risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS: We prospectively examined the association between dietary intake of trans fat and SCD among 86,762 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Coronary heart disease risk factors, including diet and lifestyle factors, were updated via questionnaires every 2 to 4 years, beginning in 1980. RESULTS: Over 26 years, we documented 317 SCD events. In the primary analysis, we found no significant association between intake of total trans fat, trans-18:1, or trans-18:2 isomers and risk of SCD. Compared to the lowest quintile of intake, the relative risk (95% CI) of SCD in the highest quintile was 1.28 (0.82-2.00) for total trans, 1.08 (0.64-1.83) for trans-18:1, and 1.19 (0.76-1.88) for trans-18:2. In a secondary prespecified analysis, total trans fat was significantly related to SCD among women who reported a diagnosis of CHD before SCD (relative risk 3.24, 95% CI 1.42-7.40 for the highest vs lowest quintile, P trend = .01); however, the test for interaction was not significant (P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort of women, neither dietary intake of trans fat nor the individual trans isomers, trans-18:1 and trans-18:2, were significantly associated with risk of SCD. However, trans fat intake may be associated with SCD risk among women with CHD, suggesting that trans fat intake may play a greater role in SCD risk among those with clinically manifest atherosclerosis.",M1
19850699,"Characteristics and clinical significance of late gadolinium enhancement by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.BACKGROUND: Myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been suggested to represent intramyocardial fibrosis and, as such, an adverse prognostic risk factor. We evaluated the characteristics of LGE on CE-MRI and explored whether LGE among patients with HCM was associated with genetic testing, severe symptoms, ventricular arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-four patients with HCM (age=55+/-16 years [range 2 to 90], 41% females), without a history of septal ablation/myectomy, underwent CE-MRI (GE 1.5 Tesla). We evaluated the relation between LGE and HCM genes status, severity of symptoms, and the degree of ventricular ectopy on Holter ECG. Subsequent SCD and appropriate implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapies were recorded during a mean follow-up of 43+/-14 months (range 16 to 94). Two hundred thirty-nine patients (56%) had LGE on CE-MRI, ranging from 0.4% to 65% of the left ventricle. Gene-positive patients were more likely to have LGE (P&lt;0.001). The frequencies of New York Heart Association class &gt;or=3 dyspnea and angina class &gt;or=3 were similar in patients with and without LGE (125 of 239 [52%] versus 94 of 185 [51%] and 24 of 239 [10%] versus 18 of 185 [10%], respectively, P=NS). LGE-positive patients were more likely to have episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (34 of 126 [27%] versus 8 of 94 [8.5%], P&lt;0.001), had more episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per patient (4.5+/-12 versus 1.1+/-0.3, P=0.04), and had higher frequency of ventricular extrasystoles/24 hours (700+/-2080 versus 103+/-460, P=0.003). During follow-up, SCD occurred in 4 patients, and additional 4 patients received appropriate ICD discharges. All 8 patients were LGE positive (event rate of 0.94%/y, P=0.01 versus LGE negative). Two additional heart failure-related deaths were recorded among LGE-positive patients. Univariate associates of SCD or appropriate ICD discharge were positive LGE (P=0.002) and presence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (P=0.04). The association of LGE with events remained significant after controlling for other risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, presence of LGE on CE-MRI was common and more prevalent among gene-positive patients. LGE was not associated with severe symptoms. However, LGE was strongly associated with surrogates of arrhythmia and remained a significant associate of subsequent SCD and/or ICD discharge after controlling for other variables. If replicated, LGE may be considered an important risk factor for sudden death in patients with HCM.",M1
19808541,"Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion defects are associated with an increased risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and sudden cardiac death.BACKGROUND: Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging defects are associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death. However, it is unknown whether single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging can identify patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed a cohort of 6383 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to examine the relationship between patient characteristics and SCD. Among patients who died, the median time to SCD was 2.7 years (25(th), 75(th) percentiles 0.9, 4.9, respectively). The incidence of SCD was 3.4% (n=215) over 6.1 years (25(th), 75(th) percentiles 3.7, 9.2, respectively) of follow-up. Patients with SCD had more severe heart failure symptoms, greater comorbidity (Charlson index), and higher summed stress perfusion scores (all P&lt;0.001). After adjusting for left ventricular ejection fraction and other clinical factors in the multivariable model, the summed stress perfusion score (fixed plus reversible defects) remained significantly associated with the occurrence of SCD: summed stress perfusion score (hazard ratios per 3 U: 1.16 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.25], P&lt;0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (hazard ratios per 5 U: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95], P&lt;0.001), and Charlson index (hazard ratios 1.35 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.49], P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial perfusion imaging is a significant predictor of SCD and provides information independent of clinical history and left ventricular ejection fraction. Gated single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, which evaluates both myocardial perfusion and function, may represent a more effective means of risk stratification than solitary left ventricular ejection fraction determination and should be evaluated in prospective trials.",M1
19797708,"Hemostasis, inflammation, and fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease: long-term follow-up of the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) cohort.OBJECTIVE: This study examines the hypothesis that chronic inflammation is associated with a higher risk of cardiac death compared to the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac death and nonfatal MI events were identified in the ARIC cohort during follow-up from 1987 through 2001. Markers of inflammation and hemostasis were determined at baseline using standardized procedures. Cox proportional hazard regression and polytomous logistic regression were used to estimate associations. We observed a positive gradient in incidence of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), nonsudden cardiac death (NSCD), and nonfatal MI in association with decreasing levels of albumin and increasing levels of white blood cell count and of markers of hemostasis (fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VIIIc). Associations for von Willebrand factor were stronger for fatal relative to nonfatal events (3rd versus 1st tertile hazard ratios: SCD 3.11 [95% CI 2.10, 4.59], NSCD 2.12 [95% CI 1.28, 3.49], nonfatal MI 1.42 [95% CI 1.19, 1.70]). For factor VIIIc those associations were strongest for sudden cardiac death: SCD 3.16 (95% CI 2.18, 4.58), NSCD 1.44 (95% CI 0.93, 2.24), nonfatal MI 1.54 (95% CI 1.29, 1.84). Gradients of association for fibrinogen and white blood cell count, examined over tertiles of distribution and per one SD increase, were similar for the 3 end points. All associations were independent of smoking status. CONCLUSIONS: von Willebrand factor and factor VIIIc are associated with an increased risk of cardiac death as compared to the risk of nonfatal MI.",M1
19789399,"Brain natriuretic peptide for the prediction of sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias: a meta-analysis.AIMS: The risk stratification of patients for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) remains a challenge. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) predicts overall mortality in heart disease but it is unclear how well it predicts SCD. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the accuracy of BNP to predict SCD and ventricular arrhythmias (VA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases and published bibliographies were systematically searched (1984-2008). We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Six studies (3543 patients) evaluated BNP to predict SCD in patients without implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) across a wide range of populations. A raised BNP predicted SCD with a relative risk of 3.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90, 7.14]. Eight studies (1047 patients) evaluated BNP to predict the occurrence of VA in patients with ICDs. A raised BNP predicted the occurrence of VA with a relative risk of 2.54 (95% CI 1.87, 3.44). CONCLUSION: The measurement of BNP has significant value in predicting SCD and VA. However, the benefit of BNP testing in addition to other risk stratification tests is unclear and BNP needs to be evaluated prospectively in combination with other complementary risk stratification tools.",M1
19756813,"Benefits and limitations of cardiovascular pre-competition screening in international football.BACKGROUND: Competitive sport can serve as a trigger for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). The majority of athletes who die suddenly have previously unsuspected structural heart disease. Medical evaluation before competition offers the potential to identify cardiovascular abnormalities in asymptomatic athletes. Consensus on the ideal screening programme has not been reached. So, a cardiovascular pre-competition screening of elite football players was developed and implemented prior to the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany to detect SCD risk factors. METHODS: Medical history, physical examination, 12-lead resting- and exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography results of the players were recorded on a standardised form by the team physicians and submitted after the final match for retrospective evaluation by two blinded independent cardiologic reviewers. RESULTS: Response rate was 82% (605 of 736 players). Completeness and quality of the recordings and examination methods differed amongst teams. In 25 players (4.8%), the examining physicians evaluated the resting ECG as pathological. Suspicious echocardiographic findings demanding further investigations to rule out serious cardiovascular disease existed in 1% of the players. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular pre-competition screening proved feasible in international elite football teams, but turned out to be vital to ensure high quality of data, particularly with regard to stress testing and echocardiography. The screening concept was revised mainly to improve completeness and quality of data acquisition. Resting ECG and echocardiography were retained, but it is questionable if exercise testing should be included in this context.",M1
19740403,"Population-based studies of antithyroid drugs and sudden cardiac death.AIM: Thyroid free T4 is associated with QTc-interval prolongation, which is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). Hyperthyroidism has been associated with SCD in case reports, but there are no population-based studies confirming this. The aim was to investigate whether use of antithyroid drugs (as a direct cause or as an indicator of poorly controlled hyperthyroidism) is associated with an increased risk of SCD. METHODS: We studied the occurrence of SCD in a two-step procedure in two different Dutch populations. First, the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study including 7898 participants (&gt; or =55 years old). Second, we used the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database, which is a longitudinal general practice research database to see whether we could replicate results from the first study. Drug use at the index date was assessed with prescription information from automated pharmacies (Rotterdam Study) or drug prescriptions from general practices (IPCI). We used a Cox proportional hazards model in a cohort analysis, adjusted for age, gender and use of QTc prolonging drugs (Rotterdam Study) and conditional logistic regression analysis in a case-control analysis, matched for age, gender, practice and calendar time and adjusted for arrhythmia and cerebrovascular ischaemia (IPCI). RESULTS: In the Rotterdam Study, 375 participants developed SCD during follow-up. Current use of antithyroid drugs was associated with SCD [adjusted hazard ratio 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 8.7]. IPCI included 1424 cases with SCD and 14 443 controls. Also in IPCI, current use of antithyroid drugs was associated with SCD (adjusted odds ratio 2.9; 95% CI 1.1, 7.4). CONCLUSIONS: Use of antithyroid drugs was associated with a threefold increased risk of SCD. Although this might be directly caused by antithyroid drug use, it might be more readily explained by underlying poorly controlled hyperthyroidism, since treated patients who developed SCD still had low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels shortly before death.",M1

A small proportion of athletes, however, are at increased risk of exercise-related sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) as a result of quiescent cardiac anomalies. The preventable nature of such deaths has prompted the medical and sporting governing bodies to recommend preparticipation cardiovascular screening (PPS) in young athletes (&lt; or =35 years) to permit the identification of potentially fatal disorders. Although evidence from the Italian experience suggests that electrocardiographic screening of young athletes has led to a significant reduction in SCD from cardiomyopathies, considerable controversy relating to the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and the impact of false-positive results of PPS still exists. This review presents an appraisal of all the available scientific evidence, attempting to resolve the concerns of the antagonists and examine how PPS compares with the World Health Organization screening criteria, providing compelling justifications for the implementation of universal PPS in young, competitive athletes.",M1
19734497,"Incidence and aetiology of sudden cardiac death in young athletes: an international perspective.The incidence of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) among young athletes is estimated to be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated. The risk of SCD in athletes is higher than in non-athletes because of several factors associated with sports activity that increase the risk in people with an underlying cardiovascular abnormality. A clear gender difference in the incidence of SCD exists in young athletes, with the risk in male athletes being up to 9 times higher than in female athletes. The most common causes of SCD in young athletes is underlying inherited/congenital cardiac disease, such as cardiomyopathies, congenital coronary anomalies and ion channelopathies. Blunt chest trauma also may cause ventricular fibrillation in a structurally normal heart, known as commotio cordis. Although geographical differences in the causes of SCD in young athletes have been reported, these disparities are more likely to be related to the type and implementation of pre-participation screening leading to the identification of athletes at risk, rather than reflecting a truly different ethiology. More studies are needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of diseases known to cause SCD in young athletes.",M1

19704100,"Maximizing survival benefit with primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in a heart failure population.BACKGROUND: Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy reduces mortality in moderately symptomatic heart failure patients with an ejection fraction &lt;or=35%, many such patients do not require ICD shocks over long-term follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a modification of a previously validated risk prediction model based on routine clinical variables, we examined the relationship between baseline predicted mortality risk and the relative and absolute survival benefits of ICD treatment in the primary prevention Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (<e>SCD</e>-HeFT). In the placebo arm, predicted 4-year mortality grouped into 5 equal-sized risk groups varied from 12% to 50% (c statistic=0.71), whereas the proportion of SCD in those same risk groups decreased from 52% to 24% of all deaths. ICD treatment decreased relative risk of SCD by 88% in the lowest-risk group versus 24% in the highest-risk group (P=0.009 for interaction) and decreased relative risk of total mortality by 54% in the lowest-risk group versus no benefit (2%) in the highest-risk group (P=0.014 for interaction). Absolute 4-year mortality reductions were 6.6%, 8.8%, 10.6%, 14.0%, and -4.9% across risk quintiles. In highest-risk patients (predicted annual mortality &gt;20%), no benefit of ICD treatment was seen. Projected over each patient's predicted lifespan, ICD treatment added 6.3, 4.1, 3.0, 1.9, and 0.2 additional years of life in the lowest- to highest-risk groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical risk prediction model identified subsets of moderately symptomatic heart failure patients in SCD-HeFT in whom single-lead ICD therapy was of no benefit and other subsets in which benefit was substantial.",M1
19699872,"Prognosis among survivors of primary ventricular fibrillation in the percutaneous coronary intervention era.BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) constitutes one of the most prevalent modes of death and is mainly caused by primary ventricular fibrillation (VF), that is, VF in the acute setting of a first acute myocardial infarction (MI). Current guidelines for secondary prevention of SCD are based on data from the thrombolysis era. We analyzed follow-up data of a large group of primary VF survivors to determine prognosis and risk of SCD in patients who received contemporary MI treatment. METHODS: Patients in this study were included in the ongoing Dutch multicenter primary VF study between December 1999 and April 2007. Primary VF was defined as VF during the first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Patients surviving the first 30 days were analyzed in this study. Data on mortality, cause of death, hospitalization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation were retrieved from national databases. In addition, data on left ventricular ejection fraction and medication use during follow-up were retrieved. RESULTS: In total, 341 primary VF patients (cases) and 292 STEMI patients without VF (controls) were included in the study. Demographic and infarct characteristics were comparable between both groups. The median follow-up was 3.33 years for cases and 3.69 for controls (P = .02). The left ventricular ejection fraction post-STEMI was 45.1% versus 46.5% (P = .342). During follow-up, 19 cases died versus 24 controls. Cox regression analysis showed no significant difference in survival between cases and controls (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.15-2.30). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 22 cases and 2 controls (P &lt; .001), but only 2 cases and 1 control patient received appropriate ICD shocks. beta-Blocker use during follow-up was 84.4% in cases versus 76.2% in controls (P = .049). Of cases, 2.5% were rehospitalized for acute MI versus 10.1% of controls (P &lt; .001). The numbers of admissions for acute coronary syndromes and chest pain were not different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients who survive the first month after primary VF have a similar prognosis as patients with a STEMI without VF. This is the first study to address this question in the modern era of reperfusion therapy. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator treatment in primary VF patients without residual ischemia or other risk factors can be safely withheld.",M1
19695463,"Clinical implications for patients with long QT syndrome who experience a cardiac event during infancy.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the clinical and prognostic aspects of long QT syndrome (LQTS)-related cardiac events that occur in the first year of life (infancy). BACKGROUND: The clinical implications for patients with long QT syndrome who experience cardiac events in infancy have not been studied previously. METHODS: The study population of 3,323 patients with QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt; or =450 ms enrolled in the International LQTS Registry involved 20 patients with sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), 16 patients with aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), 34 patients with syncope, and 3,253 patients who were asymptomatic during the first year of life. RESULTS: The risk factors for a cardiac event among 212 patients who had an electrocardiogram recorded in the first year of life included QTc &gt; or =500 ms, heart rate &lt; or =100 beats/min, and female sex. An ACA before age 1 year was associated with a hazard ratio of 23.4 (p &lt; 0.01) for ACA or SCD during ages 1 to 10 years. During the 10-year follow-up after infancy, beta-blocker therapy was associated with a significant reduction in ACA/SCD only in those with a syncopal episode within 2 years before ACA/SCD but not for those who survived ACA in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LQTS who experience ACA during the first year of life are at very high risk for subsequent ACA or death during their next 10 years of life, and beta-blockers might not be effective in preventing fatal or near-fatal cardiac events in this small but high-risk subset.",M1
19687165,"QRS duration predicts sudden cardiac death in hypertensive patients undergoing intensive medical therapy: the LIFE study.AIMS: To determine whether QRS duration predicts sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and treated hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: Over 4.8 +/- 0.9 years follow-up of 9193 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic evidence of LVH who were treated with atenolol- or losartan-based regimens, 178 patients (1.9%) suffered SCD. In multivariable analysis including randomized treatment, changing blood pressure over time, and baseline differences between patients with and without SCD, QRS duration was independently predictive of SCD (HR per 10 ms increase = 1.22, P &lt; 0.001). Baseline QRS duration remained a significant predictor of SCD even after controlling for the presence or absence of left bundle branch block (HR = 1.17, P = 0.001) and for changes in ECG LVH severity over the course of the study (HR = 1.16, P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: In the setting of aggressive antihypertensive therapy, prolonged QRS duration identifies hypertensive patients at higher risk for SCD, even after controlling for left bundle branch block, other known risk factors for SCD, and changes in blood pressure and severity of left ventricular hypertrophy.",M1
19687159,"Interleukin 18 gene promoter polymorphism: a link between hypertension and pre-hospital sudden cardiac death: the Helsinki Sudden Death Study.AIMS: The interleukin 18 (IL-18) gene has a single nucleotide promoter region (-137) G-to-C polymorphism (rs187238) which leads to attenuated transcriptional activity of the gene and to lower production of pro-atherogenic IL-18. The C allele of this polymorphism is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). We examined the process by which this polymorphism alters the risk of SCD and coronary artery disease (CAD) by analysing the interactions between this polymorphism and environmental factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: TaqMan 5' nuclease assay was used to genotype the study population of the Helsinki Sudden Death Study, comprising medicolegal autopsies of 700 men. According to adjusted logistic regression analysis, there was a significant interaction between IL-18 genotype and hypertension impacting on the risk of SCD due to coronary heart disease (CHD) (P = 0.011) and the severity of autopsy-verified CAD (P = 0.026). Among GG homozygotes, hypertension was a major risk factor for SCD due to CHD [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.75 with 95% CI 1.78-7.91, P &lt; 0.001] and hypertension also associated with larger coronary atherosclerotic plaque areas (P = 0.002) and the occurrence of complicated plaques (adjusted OR 8.38 with 95% CI 2.39-29.33, P &lt; 0.001). Among C allele carriers, hypertension was not a significant risk factor for CHD-related SCD or CAD and did not associate with the development of coronary atherosclerotic plaques. According to gene expression analysis of atherosclerotic tissue samples obtained from live patients, hypertension also interacted significantly with IL-18 genotype affecting the expression of IL-18 (P = 0.030) mRNA and interferon-gamma mRNA (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Hypertension interacts with IL-18 gene promoter -137 G/C polymorphism, affecting the risk of SCD and the development of coronary atherosclerosis.",M1
19666645,"Disease penetrance and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation carriers.AIMS: To investigate the outcome of cardiac evaluation and the risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutation carriers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-six HCM mutation carriers from 32 families identified by predictive DNA testing underwent cardiac evaluation including history, examination, electrocardiography, Doppler echocardiography, exercise testing, and 24 h Holter monitoring. The published diagnostic criteria for HCM in adult members of affected families were used to diagnose HCM. Thirty-three (43%) men and 43 (57%) women with a mean age of 42 years (range 16-79) were examined; in 31 (41%) HCM was diagnosed. Disease penetrance was age related and men were more often affected than women (P = 0.04). Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3) mutation carriers were affected at higher age than Myosin Heavy Chain (MYH7) mutation carriers (P = 0.01). Risk factors for SCD were present in affected and unaffected carriers. CONCLUSION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 41% of carriers. Disease penetrance was age dependent, warranting repeated cardiologic evaluation. The MYBPC3 mutation carriers were affected at higher age than MYH7 mutation carriers. Risk factors for SCD were present in carriers with and without HCM. Follow-up studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of risk stratification for SCD in this population.",M1
19631909,"Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death: is there a clinical role for T wave alternans?The proportion of cardiovascular deaths attributable to sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is on the rise. Herein lies the rationale for developing risk stratification strategies to predict who will benefit from prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Current guidelines recommend prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, there are clear limitations in using LVEF alone to decide who should receive an ICD. There is mounting evidence that microvolt-level T-wave alternans (TWA) is an important marker of arrhythmic risk. TWA is appealing because it noninvasively probes the underlying electrophysiological substrate and has been linked to cellular mechanisms for arrhythmias. This review considers the clinical role of TWA for risk stratification of SCD.",M1
19643915,"Genetic variation in NOS1AP is associated with sudden cardiac death: evidence from the Rotterdam Study.Common variation within the nitric oxide-1 synthase activator protein (NOS1AP) locus is strongly related to QT interval, a sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) risk factor. A recent report describes common variation in NOS1AP associated with SCD in a US population of European ancestry. The objective of the current study was to obtain additional evidence by investigating the association between NOS1AP variants and SCD in the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. The study population consisted of 5974 European ancestry subjects, aged 55 years and older, genotyped on Illumina arrays. SCD was defined according to European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure and myocardial infarction were used as covariates in Cox proportional hazard models. Results were combined with reported evidence using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. Two hundred and eight (109 witnessed) cases of SCD occurred during a mean follow-up of 10.4 years. Within the Rotterdam Study alone, no significant associations were observed. Upon pooling of results with existing data, we observed strengthening of existing evidence for rs16847549 (US data HR = 1.31, P = 0.0024; Rotterdam Study HR = 1.18, P = 0.16; joint HR = 1.26, P = 0.0011). When the case definition in the Rotterdam Study was restricted to witnessed SCD, association of rs16847549 with SCD became stronger (joint P = 0.00019) and additionally the association between rs12567209 and SCD gained significance (US data HR = 0.57, P = 0.0035; Rotterdam Study HR = 0.69, P = 0.23; joint HR = 0.60, P = 0.0018). In conclusion, this study provided additional evidence for association between genetic variation within NOS1AP and SCD. The mechanism by which this effect is exerted remains to be elucidated.",M1
19619698,"Use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention in the community: do women and men equally meet trial enrollment criteria?BACKGROUND: Fewer women than men undergo implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The criteria used to select patients for ICD implantation may be more permissive among men than for women. We hypothesized that women who undergo primary prevention ICD implantation more often meet strict trial enrollment criteria for this therapy. METHODS: We studied 59,812 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD registry undergoing initial primary prevention ICD placement between January 2005 and April 2007. Patients were classified as meeting or not meeting enrollment criteria of either the MADIT-II or <e>SCD</e>-HeFT trials. Multivariable analyses assessed the association between gender and concordance with trial criteria adjusting for demographic, clinical, and system characteristics. RESULTS: Among the cohort, 27% (n = 16,072) were women. Overall, 85.2% of women and 84.5% of men met enrollment criteria of either trial (P = .05). In multivariable analyses, women were equally likely to meet trial criteria (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99-1.10) than men. Significantly more women than men met the trial enrollment criteria among patients older than age 65 (86.6% of women vs 85.3% of men, OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.19), but this difference was not found among younger patients (82.5% of women vs 83.0% of men, OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In a national cohort undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation, older women were only slightly more likely then men to meet the enrollment criteria for MADIT II or SCD-HeFT. Relative overutilization in men is not an important explanation for gender differences in ICD implantation.",M1
19617226,"Redox modification of ryanodine receptors underlies calcium alternans in a canine model of sudden cardiac death.AIMS: Although cardiac alternans is a known predictor of lethal arrhythmias, its underlying causes remain largely undefined in disease settings. The potential role of, and mechanisms responsible for, beat-to-beat alternations in the amplitude of systolic Ca(2+) transients (Ca(2+) alternans) was investigated in a canine post-myocardial infarction (MI) model of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS AND RESULTS: Post-MI dogs had preserved left ventricular (LV) function and susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) during exercise. LV wedge preparations from VF dogs were more susceptible to action potential (AP) alternans and the frequency-dependence of Ca(2+) alternans was shifted towards slower rates in myocytes isolated from VF dogs relative to controls. In both groups of cells, cytosolic Ca(2+) transients ([Ca(2+)](c)) alternated in phase with changes in diastolic Ca(2+) in sarcoplasmic reticulum ([Ca(2+)](SR)), but the dependence of [Ca(2+)](c) amplitude on [Ca(2+)](SR) was steeper in VF cells. Abnormal ryanodine receptor (RyR) function in VF cells was indicated by increased fractional Ca(2+) release for a given amplitude of Ca(2+) current and elevated diastolic RyR-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak. SR Ca(2+) uptake activity did not differ between VF and control cells. VF myocytes had an increased rate of reactive oxygen species production and increased RyR oxidation. Treatment of VF myocytes with reducing agents normalized parameters of Ca(2+) handling and shifted the threshold of Ca(2+) alternans to higher frequencies. CONCLUSION: Redox modulation of RyRs promotes generation of Ca(2+) alternans by enhancing the steepness of the Ca(2+) release-load relationship and thereby providing a substrate for post-MI arrhythmias.",M1
19602166,"Congenital coronary artery abnormalities predisposing to sudden cardiac death.Isolated congenital coronary artery anomalies (CCAAs) are a rare but well-described cause of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). Anomalous origin of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus has been most frequently associated with myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death, particularly when the anomalous coronary courses between the great arteries. Importantly, symptoms occur in only about 50% of people with CCAA who subsequently have SCD. Echocardiography is effective in prospectively identifying these coronary artery abnormalities but requires sophisticated echo equipment and a laboratory examination with targeted, high-quality imaging. Although surgical intervention for some forms of CCAA is feasible with good early results and is clearly indicated for symptomatic patients, no clear best practice has been established for the management of those identified serendipitously without symptoms.",M1

19589438,"Risk factors and mode of death in isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children.OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to review outcomes of pediatric isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) managed uniformly at a single institution and assess whether reported adult risk factors for sudden death are predictive in pediatric HCM. BACKGROUND: Cardiac death in HCM occurs suddenly (<e>SCD</e>) or may be nonsudden (non-SCD). Little data exists on non-SCD in children. Risk factors for SCD in adult HCM are characterized and consensus management strategies detailed. Their application to children is uncertain and treatment strategies vary. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of children with HCM was performed. Primary end points were cardiac death and transplantation. Frequency and outcomes of known adult risk factors were assessed. Outcomes analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were included. The average age at diagnosis was 10.6 +/- 5.4 years, and mean follow-up was 6.4 +/- 5.2 years. Primary end points occurred in 11 patients over the 20-year follow-up (11%), 4 underwent cardiac transplant and 7 died (3 suddenly). Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy (z-score: &gt;6) and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise were predictive of non-SCD (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.03, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis predicts an 82% survival over a 20-year period. CONCLUSIONS: In children with isolated HCM managed primarily with exercise restriction and medication, cardiac death occurred infrequently. Non-SCD or transplant was at least as common as SCD. Extreme left ventricular hypertrophy and blunted blood pressure response to exercise were associated with an increased risk of non-SCD.",M1

19576339,"Sudden cardiac death in patients with silent myocardial ischemia after myocardial infarction (from the Swiss Interventional Study on Silent Ischemia Type II [SWISSI II]).The occurrence of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in patients with silent ischemia after myocardial infarction (MI) and the factors facilitating SCD are unknown. This study aimed to determine the factors facilitating SCD in patients with silent ischemia after MI. In the Swiss Interventional Study on Silent Ischemia Type II (SWISSI II), 201 patients with silent ischemia after MI were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical management. The main end point of the present analysis was SCD. Multivariable regression models were used to detect potential associations between baseline or follow-up variables and SCD. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 +/- 2.6 years, 12 SCDs occurred, corresponding to an average annual event rate of 0.6%. On multivariate regression analysis, the decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during follow-up was the only independent predictor of SCD (p = 0.011), other than age; however, the baseline LVEF was not. The decline in LVEF was greater in patients receiving medical management than in those who had received PCI (p &lt;0.001), as well as in patients with residual myocardial ischemia or recurrent MI compared with patients without these findings (p = 0.038 and p &lt;0.001, respectively). Compared with medical management, PCI reduced the rate of residual myocardial ischemia (p &lt;0.001) and recurrent MI (p = 0.001) during follow-up. In conclusion, patients with silent ischemia after MI are at a substantial risk of SCD. The prevention of residual myocardial ischemia and recurrent MI using PCI resulted in better long-term LVEF and a reduced SCD incidence.",M1
19576333,"Ventricular arrhythmia following alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.We sought to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) and ventricular arrhythmia after alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ASA is a nonsurgical alternative to septal myectomy for treatment of symptomatic, drug-refractory, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The effect of ASA on ventricular arrhythmia risk is not well established. We examined the rates of SCD among 89 patients treated with ASA. The secondary end point was ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, or cardiac arrest after ASA among those with implanted ICDs or permanent pacemakers (n = 42). Patients were classified as either high-risk or low-risk on the basis of established clinical indications for ICD implantation. No mortality was attributable to SCD at a mean follow-up of 5.0 +/- 2.3 years in the entire cohort. Among the 42 patients with an ICD or permanent pacemaker, 9 had documented VT/VF, cardiac arrest, or appropriate ICD therapy, resulting in an annual event rate of 4.9%/year. The annual event rate for VT/VF, cardiac arrest, or appropriate ICD therapy was 2.8%/year (4 of 29 patients) in low-risk patients and 13.4% in high-risk patients (5 of 13 patients). A 10-mm Hg increase in the immediate post-ASA gradient was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.66 for arrhythmic events (95% confidence interval 1.55 to 4.56, p &lt;0.001). In conclusion, ASA was performed in patients with highly symptomatic, drug-refractory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with no mortality attributable to SCD and an annual rate of VT/VF, cardiac arrest, or appropriate ICD therapy of 4.9%/year.",M1
19564966,"Cardiac gene defects can cause sudden cardiac death in young people.BACKGROUND: In Europe, sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is one of the most common causes of death. Although sudden cardiac death usually happens in older people, 5% to 10% of the affected individuals are young and apparently healthy. Sudden death in infants, children, and young adults is relatively rare, with an incidence of 1 to 5 per 100 000 persons per year. Nonetheless, up to 7000 asymptomatic children die in the USA each year, almost half of them without any warning signs or symptoms. METHOD: Selective literature review. RESULTS: Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases. Most of these diseases are hereditary with autosomal-dominant transmission, i.e., there is a 50% chance that the children of affected individuals will be affected themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Post-mortem genetic screening for sequence variations in cardiac ion channel genes has become an important forensic tool for elucidating the cause of sudden cardiac death. Moreover, it allows the identification of other family members bearing the previously undiagnosed gene defect, who can then undergo a cardiological evaluation if indicated by their clinical history.",M1
19520557,"Cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.The incidence of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), myocardial infarction, others) varies, depending on conventional risk factors. However, in Western countries, like the US or Germany, incidences of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease are far higher than in countries like Japan. In the present article, these differences are discussed and related to eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5omega-3 or C20:5n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6omega-3; DHA). Dietary intake of EPA and DHA and a number of other factors determine levels of EPA and DHA in an individual--best assessed as the omega-3 index, defined as the percentage of EPA and DHA in red cells, and analyzed in a standardized fashion. A review of the literature, expanded by measurements of the omega-3 index, indicates that the risk of sudden cardiac death correlates inversely with the omega-3 index. For persons with an omega-3 index &lt;4%, risk is tenfold, as compared to persons with an omega-3 index &gt;8%. A similar, less-pronounced, correlation exists for non-fatal cardiovascular disease. EPA and DHA have anti-arrhythmic and anti-atherosclerotic mechanisms of action. In large-scale intervention studies, intake of EPA and DHA has been demonstrated to reduce SCD and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Assessing or recommending dietary intake of EPA and DHA does not predict the resulting omega-3 index. Taken together, the omega-3 index is a biomarker to assess a person's content of omega-3 fatty acids, and thus the risk for sudden cardiac death, as well as non-fatal cardiovascular events. EPA and DHA prevent fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease and complications of congestive heart failure.",M1
19493393,"Prognostic factors affecting the all-cause death and sudden cardiac death rates of post myocardial infarction patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction.BACKGROUND: Post myocardial infarction (post-MI) patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have been candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) since the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trail II (MADIT II). However, due to the high costs of ICDs, widespread usage has not been accepted. Therefore, further risk stratification for post-MI patients with low LVEF may aid in the selection of patients that will benefit most from ICD treatment. METHODS: Four hundred and seventeen post-MI patients with low LVEF (&lt; or = 35%) were enrolled in the study. All the patients received standard examination and proper treatment and were followed up to observe the all-cause death rate and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) rate. Then COX proportional-hazards regression model was used to investigate the clinical factors which affect the all-cause death rate and SCD rate. RESULTS: Of 55 patients who died during (32 +/- 24) months of follow-up, 37 (67%) died suddenly. After adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, multivariate COX proportional-hazards regression model identified the following variables associated with death from all causes: New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure class &gt; or = III (Hazard ratio: 2.361), LVEF &lt; or = 20% (Hazard ratio: 2.514), sustained ventricular tachycardia (Hazard ratio: 6.453), and age &gt; or = 70 years (Hazard ratio: 3.116). The presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (Hazard ratio: 6.491) and age &gt; or = 70 years (Hazard ratio: 2.694) were specifically associated with SCD. CONCLUSIONS: In the post-MI patients with low LVEF, factors as LVEF &lt; or = 20%, age &gt; or = 70 years, presence of ventricular tachycardia, and NYHA heart failure class &gt; or = III predict an adverse outcome. The presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia and age &gt; or = 70 years was associated with occurrence of SCD in these patients.",M1

19474054,"Usefulness of cardiac magnetic resonance in assessing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.AIMS: To assess the relationship between cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters and both spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) and risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eight consecutive HCM patients (mean age 42 +/- 15 years, 76% males) underwent CMR evaluation and risk assessment. Delayed contrast enhancement (DCE) was quantified with a specifically designed score. Endpoints were either the presence of clinical VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF) or of acknowledged risk factors for SCD. Compared to patients without arrhythmia, those with VT/VF (n = 33) had a higher DCE score [median 8 (2-13) vs. 11 (6-20); P = 0.01]; DCE score was also the only independent predictor of VT/VF in the multivariable model. DCE score [median 6 (1-10.5) vs. 12 (6-18); P = 0.001], mean and maximal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (MaxLVWT), as well as LV mass index were significantly greater among patients at risk for SCD (n = 51) compared with the remaining 57 patients at low risk. DCE score and MaxLVWT were independent predictors of SCD risk. CONCLUSION: In HCM patients several CMR parameters are associated with risk for SCD. A semi-quantitative index of DCE is a significant multivariable predictor of both clinical VT/VF and of risk for SCD and may contribute to risk assessment in borderline or controversial cases.",M1
19470888,"Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as predictors of sudden cardiac death among women.BACKGROUND: Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been found to predict risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in patients with known cardiac disease, and C-reactive protein levels have been found to predict risk among apparently healthy men. However, there are no data on SCD risk prediction for either of these markers in a population of women unselected on the basis of cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective, nested, case-control analysis within the 121,700-participant Nurses' Health Study, 99 cases of definite or probable SCD were identified and matched to 294 controls. In multivariable models that adjusted for coronary heart disease risk factors, glomerular filtration rate, and other biomarkers, the trend across quartiles approached significance for NT-proBNP (rate ratio=2.37 for comparison of the highest and lowest quartile; P for trend=0.05) but not for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P for trend=0.60). When examined continuously, both NT-proBNP and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were significantly associated with SCD risk in age- and fasting-adjusted models (P for linear trend=0.04 and 0.03). Adjustment for coronary heart disease risk factors and other biomarkers strengthened the relationship with NT-proBNP and SCD (relative risk for 1-SD increment=1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.05; P=0.01) but eliminated the relationship with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P=0.34). Women with NT-proBNP levels above the prespecified cut point of 389 pg/mL were at a markedly increased risk of SCD in both models (rate ratio=5.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.78 to 18.2; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of women, baseline levels of NT-proBNP were associated with subsequent risk of SCD. If this association is confirmed in larger prospectively studied populations, these findings might provide another useful marker contributing to efforts to screen and prevent SCD among women.",M1
19465437,"The current status of interventions aiming at reducing sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients.Mortality in dialysis patients is extremely high, with an annual death rate of approximately 23%. Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is the single largest cause of death in dialysis patients accounting for approximately 60% of all cardiac deaths and 25% of all-cause mortality. Interventions aiming at reducing cardiovascular mortality, especially SCD, in dialysis patients are therefore extremely important and clinically highly relevant. The purpose of this review is to give an outline of the epidemiology of SCD in dialysis patients and to provide a comprehensive overview of several interventional strategies (medical therapies, changing dialysis modality, and revascularization). Furthermore, it will discuss the current knowledge regarding the value of preventive implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation and address future implications of the interventional strategies mentioned.",M1
19463119,"[Sudden cardiac death and polymorphism of genes-candidates of cardiovascular diseases]Aim of the study was to elucidate genetic markers associated with elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). We collected autopsy material during 1999 - 2001 in a process of forensic medical pathologo-anatomical examination of corpses of 182 men who had died suddenly in Octyabrsky district of Novosibirsk in the age of 25 - 64 years (mean age 53,6 +/- 7,9 years). We studied polymorphisms of the following genes: angiotensin converting enzyme - , glycoprotein IIb/IIIa - GPIIb/IIIa, alpha2b adrenoreceptor - ADRA2B, beta(1)-adrenoreceptor - ADRB1. Control comprised samples of population of men aged 25 - 35 and 55 - 64 years from the same district of Novosibirsk examined within framework of international WHO project MONICA. Comparison of frequencies of genotypes of polymorphism A1/A2 of GPIIb/IIIa gene in combined sample of population and group with SCD revealed in SCD group lowering of portion of A2/A2 homozygotes (5.0 and 1.2%, respectively, =0.029) and elevation of portion of A1/A2 heterozygotes (18.7 and 28.3%, respectively, =0.027). Odds ratio for a heterozygote to enter SCD group was 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.77). Comparison of frequencies of genotypes and alleles of polymorphism A145G of ADRB1 gene in combined sample of population and group with SCD did not reveal any difference. Comparison of frequencies of polymorphism I/D of ACE gene in combined sample of population and group with SCD revealed significant lowering of frequencies of genotype I/I in SCD group (22.0 and 13.8%, respectively, p=0.033). There were no significant differences between SCD group and control in frequencies of studied polymorphism of alpha2b-adrenoreceptor gene.",M1
19455567,"Cardiac amyloidosis treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and subcutaneous array lead system: report of a case and literature review.BACKGROUND: Preventing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is challenging since the amyloid protein deposition in the myocardium may interfere with the normal cardiac electric excitation. Most of these patients succumb to either progressive congestive heart failure, or sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) offers a near sure means of preventing SCD. HYPOTHESIS: Myocardial infiltration with amyloid results in elevated defibrillation threshold (DFT). Intra-operative strategies may fail to lower DFT during implantation. METHODS: We present a case of a 64-year-old female who had cardiac amyloidosis, and was successfully treated with an ICD and a subcutaneous array lead system. CONCLUSION: A subcutaneous array lead system is useful in reducing the DFT, and can terminate ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation by allowing more energy delivery and efficient defibrillation.",M1
19443476,"Aetiology of sudden cardiac death in athletes in the United Kingdom: a pathological study.OBJECTIVE: To characterise the demographics and aetiology of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) in athletes referred to a tertiary cardiac pathology centre in the UK. DESIGN: Retrospective non-case controlled analysis. SETTING: Cardiac pathology centre at the National Heart and Lung Institute and Royal Brompton Hospital. SUBJECTS: Between 1996 and 2008, the hearts of 118 athletes were referred for pathological assessment to ascertain the precise aetiology of SCD. RESULTS: The majority of athletes (n = 113; 96%) were male and most (107; 91%) were amateurs participating predominantly in football, rugby and running. The mean (SD) age of death was 28 (12) years (range 7-59); 75% athletes were aged &lt; or =35 years. Most deaths (81%) occurred during or immediately after exercise. Antecedent symptoms of cardiac disease were reported in 21 (18%) subjects, and 20 (17%) had a family history of premature cardiovascular disease and/or SCD. 25 (21%) athletes had relevant past medical history which included a known history of cardiac disease. Cardiomyopathy was the commonest cause of death and accounted for 62% of all the SCDs. A significantly high proportion of athletes (23%) exhibited a morphologically normal heart. Atherosclerotic coronary disease accounted for only 3% of cases and was confined to athletes aged &gt;35 years. CONCLUSIONS: SCD in sport is largely due to clinically silent cardiomyopathies or primary electrical disorders (morphologically normal heart). Antecedent symptoms and family history are absent in over 80% of cases, and therefore clinical screening with health questionnaires will fail to identify most athletes with potentially sinister cardiac disorders.",M1
19425347,"[Cardiac sudden death in Italy. Dimensions, perceptions, policies and economic/financial impact]This study is based on the consideration that sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) incidence is increasing in today's society and, despite the efforts of clinicians, there is great lack of awareness and focus for its prevention on behalf of society and institutions. During 2006 a research project on SCD was initiated in Italy by the CUSAS (Centro Universitario di Studi in Amministrazione Sanitaria) and the Institute for Internal Medicine and Cardiology of the University of Florence with the intention to: estimate the dimension(s) of the SCD phenomenon in the general population; underline the economical consequences of SCD; identify the causes for the lack of interest in SCD; evaluate the degree of use of biomedical technologies for SCD prevention, and compare the actual scenario with the ideal one (driven by treatment guidelines implementation); the last part of the study analyzes economical sustainability of the implementation of the 2006 European Society of Cardiology new guidelines. We estimated an occurrence of SCD in young subjects (between 35 and 65 years of age) of roughly 9300 cases per year (approximately 17% of total): nearly one case of SCD in 5 afflicts young and still active individuals. Causes of the phenomenon vary greatly: in older subjects the pathology that most frequently causes SCD is ischemic heart disease, whereas in younger subjects it is more often related to heart failure. The most optimistic hypothesis is that each year SCD causes the loss of nearly 600 000 life years. We came up with a first estimate of the socio-economic impact due to life years lost each year to SCD, using net individual work salary for the basis of the calculation. Results are extremely variable (between 6.482 and 12.216 millions of euros each year). Considering that half of the events occur in patients in whom SCD can be accurately predicted, due to their high risk factor, it is possible to estimate the financial investment necessary to prevent SCD in at least these individuals. The DRG tariff is used as a proxy for the economic calculation of the procedure costs. An additional investment of 310 million euros would have been necessary, which represents only 0.33% of the national health budget for that same year. We strongly believe that preventing SCD is not only financially feasible but very beneficial from the societal perspective.",M1
19422577,"Primary prevention implantation of cardioverter defibrillator without defibrillation threshold testing: 2-year follow-up.BACKGROUND: Even though the intraoperative threshold testing of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may cause hemodynamic impairment or be unfeasible, it is still considered required standard practice at the time of implantation. We compared the outcome of ICD recipients who underwent defibrillation threshold testing (DFT) with that of patients in whom no testing was performed. METHODS: A total of 291 subjects with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy received transvenous ICDs between January 2000 and December 2004 in five Italian cardiology centers. In two centers, DFT was routinely performed in 137 patients (81% men; mean age 69+/-9 years; mean ejection fraction 26+/-4%) (DFT group), while three centers never performed DFT in 154 patients (90% men; mean age 69+/-9 years; mean ejection fraction 27+/-5%) (no-DFT group). RESULTS: We compared total mortality, total cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), and spontaneous episodes of ventricular arrhythmia (sustained ventricular tachycardia, VT, and ventricular fibrillation, VF) between these groups 2 years after implantation (median 23 months, 25th-75th percentile, 12-44 months). On comparing the DFT and no-DFT groups, we found an overall mortality rate of 20% versus 16%, cardiovascular mortality of 13% versus 10%, SCD of 3% versus 0.6%, VT incidence of 8% versus 10%, and VF incidence of 6% versus 4% (no significant difference in any comparison). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in the incidence of clinical outcomes considered emerged between no-DFT and DFT groups. These results should be confirmed in larger prospective studies.",M1
19419401,"ST segment  hump  during exercise testing and the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.BACKGROUND: The appearance of a discrete upward deflection of the ST segment termed  the ST hump sign  (STHS) during exercise testing has been associated with resting hypertension and exaggerated blood pressure response to exercise. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of this sign in a population of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing were followed in a retrospective cohort study for a mean period of 5.3 years. RESULTS: The appearance of the STHS at the peak of exercise testing was observed in 42 patients (52%), particularly in the inferior and the lateral leads. Patients with the STHS had higher fractional shortening and maximum left ventricular wall thickness and exhibited more frequently outflow tract gradient &gt;30 mmHg at rest. Furthermore, the presence of STHS was a strong independent predictor of the risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), as the latter occurred in eight of the patients with this sign (8/42, 19%) and in none of the patients without it (0/39, 0%) (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: The appearance of a  hump  at the ST segment during exercise testing appears to be a risk factor for SCD in patients with HCM. However, further studies are necessary to validate this finding in larger populations and to elucidate the mechanism of the appearance of the  hump. ",M1
19408839,"Genetic screening of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--a new diagnostic strategy for risk stratification?Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease of the heart muscle and its main characteristic is unexplained hypertrophy of the left and/or the right ventricle. HCM is the most common genetically determined cardiovascular disease and is prevalent in approximately in 1 of 500 of the population. The most serious complication of HCM is sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) which can be the first manifestation of the disease. However, there are other forms of benign prognosis which do not jeopardize patient's health or life. The clinical symptoms of HCM are partly dependent on mutations in affected sarcomere genes. Different mutations in the same gene can present as malign with a high risk of SCD, while other mutations can be benign. The clinical symptomatology can also be influenced by other factors such as the presence of polymorphisms in other genes. Nowadays the aim of intensive clinical research is to access the contribution of molecular genetic methods in HCM diagnostics as well as in risk stratification of SCD. It is expected that genetic analyses will have an important consequence in the screening the relatives of HCM patients and also in the prenatal diagnostics and genetic counseling (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 45).

A primary factor of SCD is not traumatic. It occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. The high risk of development of sudden cardiac death is basically associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Electrophysiological anomalies in cells lead to development of ventricular ectopic activity or ventricular tachycardia which comes to the end with fibrillation. The ultimate goal of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to restore normal rhythm and conduction Treatment of ventricular arrhythmia provides application of antiarrhythmic medicines, beta-adrenoblokators, amiodarone, lidocaine, sotalole, implantation cardioverters - defibrillators (ID), catheter ablation, surgical manipulations.

Since all such interventions come with their attendant risks, however, stratification procedures aimed at identifying those who stand to benefit overall have gained a new degree of importance. This review assesses the value of risk stratification measures currently available in clinical practice, as well as of others that may soon enter the market. Parameters that may be obtained only by performing invasive cardiac catheterisation procedures are considered separately from those that may be derived using more readily available non-invasive techniques. It is concluded that effective stratification is likely to require the use of composite parameters and that invasive procedures might only be justified in specific sub-groups of patients.",M1

There are conflicting data regarding the efficacy and safety of amiodarone for the prevention of SCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials examining the use of amiodarone vs. placebo/control for the prevention of SCD. We identified 15 trials, which randomized 8522 patients to amiodarone or placebo/control. Amiodarone decreased the incidence of SCD [7.1 vs. 9.7%; OR 0.71 (0.61-0.84), P &lt; 0.001] and cardiovascular death (CVD) [14.0 vs. 16.3%; OR 0.82 (0.71-0.94), P = 0.004]. There was a 1.5% absolute risk reduction in all-cause mortality which did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.093). Amiodarone therapy increased the risk of pulmonary [2.9 vs. 1.5%; OR 1.97, (1.27-3.04), P = 0.002], and thyroid [3.6 vs. 0.4%; OR 5.68, (2.94-10.98), P &lt; 0.001] toxicity. CONCLUSION: Amiodarone reduces the risk of SCD by 29% and CVD by 18%, and therefore, represents a viable alternative in patients who are not eligible for or who do not have access to ICD therapy for the prevention of SCD. However, amiodarone therapy is neutral with respect to all-cause mortality and is associated with a two- and five-fold increased risk of pulmonary and thyroid toxicity.",M1
19301163,"Impaired exercise capacity predicts sudden cardiac death in a low-risk population: enhanced specificity with heightened T-wave alternans.AIMS: Because sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is due to cardiac electrical instability, we postulated that prediction of this mode of death by exercise capacity will be enhanced by combined assessment with T-wave alternans (TWA), an index of repolarization abnormality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Finnish Cardiovascular Study enrolled consecutive patients (n=2,044) with a routine clinically indicated exercise test. Exercise capacity was measured in metabolic equivalents (METs) and TWA by time-domain modified moving average method. RESULTS: During 47.2+/-12.8-month follow-up (mean+/-SD) 120 patients died; 58 were cardiovascular deaths, and 29 were SCD. In multivariate analysis after adjustment for sex, age, smoking, use of beta-blockers, as well as other common coronary risk factors, the relative risk of patients whose exercise capacity was depressed (MET &lt; 8) was 8.8 (95% CI 2.0-38.9, P=0.004) for SCD. The combination of low exercise capacity (MET &lt; 8) and elevated TWA (&gt; or =65 microV) yielded relative risks for SCD of 36.1 (6.3-206.0, P&lt;0.001), for cardiovascular mortality of 21.1 (6.7-66.2, P&lt;0.001), and for all-cause mortality of 7.8 (3.5-17.4, P&lt;0.001) over patients with neither factor. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced exercise capacity, particularly in combination with heightened TWA, indicating enhanced cardiac electrical instability, powerfully predicts risk for SCD in patients referred for exercise testing.",M1

BACKGROUND: Depression is a risk factor for cardiac events and mortality among those with CHD, possibly from arrhythmia. METHODS: We studied depressive symptoms and a proxy variable for clinical depression consisting of severe symptoms and/or antidepressant medication use and their relationship to cardiac events in the Nurses' Health Study. Questionnaires in 1992, 1996, and 2000 assessed symptoms with the Mental Health Index (MHI-5), and antidepressant use was assessed in 1996 and 2000. Primary end points included SCD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Among 63,469 women without prior CHD/stroke in 1992, 7.9% had MHI-5 scores &lt;53, previously found to predict clinical depression. Depressive symptoms were associated with CHD events, and the relationship was strongest for fatal CHD, where the association remained significant even after controlling for CHD risk factors (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11 to 2.00 for MHI-5 score &lt;53). In models from 1996 onward, our proxy variable for clinical depression was most associated with SCD in multivariable models (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.47 to 3.70), and this risk was primarily due to a specific relationship between antidepressant use and SCD (HR: 3.34, 95% CI: 2.03 to 5.50). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of women without baseline CHD, depressive symptoms were associated with fatal CHD, and a measure of clinical depression including antidepressant use was specifically associated with SCD. Although antidepressant use might be a marker of worse depression, its specific association with SCD merits further study.",M1
19251228,"Strategies for reducing sudden cardiac death: application of microvolt T-wave alternans testing in clinical practice.The public health challenge of preventing sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is significant. Various risk factors for SCD have been well articulated from clinical trials and the importance of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has been validated. However, significant challenges persist in identifying which patients are most vulnerable to SCD, particularly in the setting of preserved left ventricular systolic function. The current article outlines strategies to capture high-risk patients. This strategy includes the implementation of noninvasive risk stratification with microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) as well as utilizing health information technology (HIT) to identify patients at risk. The application of HIT in a clinic setting provides electronic decision support tools to document adherence to currently published cardiovascular practice guidelines. Electronic alerts facilitate measurement of LVEF as well as ensure that patients are receiving optimal pharmacologic therapy. A process of care is outlined for patients who are discharged post myocardial infarction and post congestive heart failure hospitalization. This coupled with educational information provided to families and primary care physicians is supportive of an overall process of care focused on SCD prevention. The current article outlines the role of implementing these strategies in a community practice setting to potentially reduce the burden of SCD.",M1

METHODS: Eligibility was assessed retrospectively at 6 weeks in 513 post-MI survivors (age 66 +/- 13 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 48.2 +/- 17%) on the basis of an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram. RESULTS: LVEF was &lt; or = 40% in 37% and &lt; or = 35% in 30%, and QRS duration was &lt;120 ms in 89% and &gt; or =120 ms in 11% of patients.

19264750,"Incidence and prognostic significance of sustained ventricular tachycardias in heart failure patients implanted with biventricular pacemakers without a back-up defibrillator: results from the prospective, multicentre, Mona Lisa cohort study.AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the 12-month incidence, predictive factors, and prognosis of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) in chronic heart failure patients implanted with biventricular pacemakers without a back-up defibrillator (CRT-P), assessed by continuous intracardiac ventricular electrograms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Mona Lisa study, a prospective, multicentre, cohort study, designed to determine the incidence of sustained VT and its prognostic impact in CRT-P recipients within the year after implant enrolled 198 patients with moderate or severe chronic heart failure, despite optimal pharmacological therapy. An independent committee reviewed the data from all arrhythmic episodes as well as causes of death according to predefined criteria. During a mean follow-up of 9.8 +/- 3.1 months after implantation, 8 patients experienced at least one episode of sustained VT [4.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-7.5] and 21 deaths occurred, giving a 12-month mortality rate of 11.7% (95% CI, 6.4-16.9). The presence of sustained VT was associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) and the lowest 12-month overall survival (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of sustained VT remains relatively low in the first year after CRT-P implantation, but when present appears closely associated with short-term adverse outcomes, especially SCD. This emphasizes the possible value of remote monitoring to detect high-risk patients for urgent upgrading.",M1

19219394,"Prognostic value of heart rate variability and ventricular arrhythmias during 13-year follow-up in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.BACKGROUND: In contrast to patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure (CHF), data regarding long-term outcome in patients with mild CHF are scarce. We examined the place of Holter monitoring to study the prognostic value of ventricular arrhythmias and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with mild to moderate CHF during long-term follow-up. METHODS: We studied 90 patients with mild to moderate CHF and NYHA class II who had been enrolled in the Dutch Ibopamine Multicenter Trial. At baseline their mean age was 60.5 +/- 8.0 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.29 +/- 0.09, and 85% were males. At the start of the study, patients were only using diuretics, while digoxin, and particularly ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers were initiated later. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazard analyses were performed. RESULTS: At baseline 80% of patients were in NYHA class II, and 20% were in class III; their mean age was 60 years, mean LVEF was 0.29, and 85% were men. During a follow-up of 13 years, 47 patients (53%) died. Cardiovascular (CV) death occurred in 39 patients, of which 28 were sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). For both CV death and SCD, LVEF &lt;30% and ventricular premature beats/h (&gt;20) were independent risk markers. Of the HRV parameters, total power (&gt;2,500 ms(2)) was an important risk marker for CV death, but not for SCD. CONCLUSION: The present 13-year follow-up study in 90 patients with mild to moderate CHF showed that ventricular premature beats and HRV may have important value in predicting outcome.",M1

The present analysis was conducted to validate the association between NOS1AP variants and the QT interval and to examine the association with SCD in a combined population of 19 295 black and white adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 19 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomic blocks containing rs10494366 and rs4657139 in NOS1AP. SCD was defined as a sudden pulseless condition of cardiac origin in a previously stable individual. General linear models and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NOS1AP, including rs10494366, rs4657139, and rs16847548, were significantly associated with adjusted QT interval in whites (P&lt;0.0001). In whites, after adjustment for age, sex, and study, the relative hazard of SCD associated with each C allele at rs16847548 was 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.56, P=0.002), assuming an additive model. In addition, a downstream neighboring single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs12567209, which was not correlated with rs16847548 or QT interval, was also independently associated with SCD in whites (relative hazard 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83, P=0.003). Adjustment for QT interval and coronary heart disease risk factors attenuated but did not eliminate the association between rs16847548 and SCD, and such adjustment had no effect on the association between rs12567209 and SCD. No significant associations between tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NOS1AP and either QT interval or SCD were observed in blacks. CONCLUSIONS: In a combined analysis of 2 population-based prospective cohort studies, sequence variations in NOS1AP were associated with baseline QT interval and the risk of SCD in white US adults.",M1
19188705,"Genomic imbalances in key ion channel genes and telomere shortening in sudden cardiac death victims.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) can be caused by a number of reasons. Previous works have identified the genetic causes, such as alterations in the DNA sequence, for many of these diseases. We hypothesize that some patients may show genomic imbalances and changes in the gene copy number leading to genetic instability. To clarify this, we analysed DNA samples from SCD victims using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a molecular cytogenetic technique that permits the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances, and telomere length measurement. DNA derived from peripheral blood and heart tissue of 14 SCD cases and six apparently healthy control individuals were subjected to CGH analysis. Telomere length measurements were done by the Southern blotting method. Eight out of 14 SCD cases exhibited changes in DNA/gene copy number. CGH analysis showed variation in the gene copy number of some of the genes associated with potassium (KCNAB1, KCNH2, and KCNA4) and calcium (RyR2, ATP2A2) ions which are involved in maintaining the ionic balance of the heart. Alterations in TERC and TERT genes were also detected in SCD victims. In nine SCD victims shorter telomeres were detected. This might have resulted from excessive cellular proliferation and/or oxidative stress in these individuals. Copy number changes observed and telomere shortening detected in SCD cases would possibly explain at least some of the causes of SCD at early ages in humans. Identification of biomarkers of SCD is of great importance and thus the present study will facilitate the identification of some of the biomarkers.",M1
19185651,"Competing risk analysis of cause-specific mortality in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: The EVADEF cohort study.BACKGROUND: Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, enrolling highly selected patients, mortality events in ICD patients have received little attention in routine medical care. We sought to assess the 24-month total and cause-specific mortality rates and their predictors in  real life  patients with an ICD. METHODS: The Evaluation Médico-Economique du Défibrillateur Automatique Implantable study was a French multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of ICD patients with a 2-year follow-up. Cause-specific mortality rates and predictors at implantation of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) or progressive heart failure (HF) death were assessed using competing risk methodology. RESULTS: From June 2001 to June 2003, 2,296 unselected patients were implanted and followed until June 2005. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 +/- 6.7 months, 274 deaths occurred: 29 (10.6%) were SCD and 146 (53.3%) were HF deaths, corresponding to 24-month cause-specific mortality rates of 1.4% (95% confidence interval 0.9%-1.9%) and 6.9% (95% confidence interval 5.8%-8.0%), respectively. Among the characteristics at implantation, ejection fraction (EF) &lt;30% and history of atrial fibrillation were independently associated with SCD; age, high New York Heart Association class, systemic hypertension, prior atrial fibrillation, QRS duration, EF &lt;30%, and lack of beta-blocker therapy were independently associated with HF death. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of  daily  patients, the 2-year incidence of SCD (1.4%) was comparable with the event rate observed in randomized controlled trials; HF remained the predominant mode of death. An EF &lt;30% at implantation appears to be the most important predictor of ICD-unresponsive SCD.",M1
19180230,"Multiple independent genetic factors at NOS1AP modulate the QT interval in a multi-ethnic population.Extremes of electrocardiographic QT interval are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>); thus, identification and characterization of genetic variants that modulate QT interval may elucidate the underlying etiology of SCD. Previous studies have revealed an association between a common genetic variant in NOS1AP and QT interval in populations of European ancestry, but this finding has not been extended to other ethnic populations. We sought to characterize the effects of NOS1AP genetic variants on QT interval in the multi-ethnic population-based Dallas Heart Study (DHS, n = 3,072). The SNP most strongly associated with QT interval in previous samples of European ancestry, rs16847548, was the most strongly associated in White (P = 0.005) and Black (P = 3.6 x 10(-5)) participants, with the same direction of effect in Hispanics (P = 0.17), and further showed a significant SNP x sex-interaction (P = 0.03). A second SNP, rs16856785, uncorrelated with rs16847548, was also associated with QT interval in Blacks (P = 0.01), with qualitatively similar results in Whites and Hispanics. In a previously genotyped cohort of 14,107 White individuals drawn from the combined Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohorts, we validated both the second locus at rs16856785 (P = 7.63 x 10(-8)), as well as the sex-interaction with rs16847548 (P = 8.68 x 10(-6)). These data extend the association of genetic variants in NOS1AP with QT interval to a Black population, with similar trends, though not statistically significant at P&lt;0.05, in Hispanics. In addition, we identify a strong sex-interaction and the presence of a second independent site within NOS1AP associated with the QT interval. These results highlight the consistent and complex role of NOS1AP genetic variants in modulating QT interval.",M1
19179201,"Cardiac iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging predicts sudden cardiac death independently of left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction: results from a comparative study with signal-averaged electrocardiogram, heart rate variability, and QT dispersion.OBJECTIVES: We prospectively compared the predictive value of cardiac iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) with that of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG), heart rate variability (HRV), and QT dispersion in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUND: Cardiac MIBG imaging predicts prognosis of CHF patients. However, the long-term predictive value of MIBG imaging for SCD in this population remains to be elucidated. METHODS: At entry, cardiac MIBG imaging, SAECG, 24-h Holter monitoring, and standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) were performed in 106 consecutive stable CHF outpatients with a radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40%. The cardiac MIBG washout rate (WR) was obtained from MIBG imaging. Furthermore, the time and frequency domain HRV parameters were calculated from 24-h Holter recordings, and QT dispersion was measured from the 12-lead ECG. RESULTS: During a follow-up period of 65 +/- 31 months, 18 of 106 patients died suddenly. A multivariate Cox analysis revealed that WR and LVEF were significantly and independently associated with SCD, whereas the SAECG, HRV parameters, or QT dispersion were not. Patients with an abnormal WR (&gt;27%) had a significantly higher risk of SCD (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.55 to 14.76). Even when confined to the patients with LVEF &gt;35%, SCD was significantly more frequently observed in the patients with than without an abnormal WR (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac MIBG WR, but not SAECG, HRV, or QT dispersion, is a powerful predictor of SCD in patients with mild-to-moderate CHF, independently of LVEF.",M1
19175840,"Enhanced predictive power of quantitative TWA during routine exercise testing in the Finnish Cardiovascular Study.INTRODUCTION: We examined whether quantification of T-wave alternans (TWA) enhances this parameter's capacity to evaluate the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS AND RESULTS: The Finnish Cardiovascular Study (FINCAVAS) enrolled consecutive patients (n = 2,119; 1,342 men and 777 women) with a clinically indicated exercise test with bicycle ergometer. TWA (time domain-modified moving average method) was analyzed from precordial leads, and the results were grouped in increments of 10 microV. Hazard ratios (HR) for total and cardiovascular mortality and SCD were estimated for preexercise, routine exercise, and postexercise stages. Cox regression analysis was performed. During follow-up of 47.1 +/- 12.9 months (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), 126 patients died: 62 were cardiovascular deaths, and 33 of these deaths were sudden. During preexercise, TWA &gt;or= 20 microV predicted the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality (maximum HR &gt;4.4 at 60 microV, P &lt; 0.02 for both). During exercise, HRs of total and cardiovascular mortality were significant when TWA measured &gt;or=50 microV, with 90 microV TWA yielding maximum HRs for total and cardiovascular death of 3.1 (P = 0.03) and 6.4 (P = 0.002), respectively. During postexercise, TWA &gt;or=60 microV indicated risk for total and cardiovascular mortality, with maximum HR of 3.4 at 70 microV (P = 0.01) for cardiovascular mortality. SCD was strongly predicted by TWA levels &gt;or=60 microV during exercise, with maximum HR of 4.6 at 60 microV (P = 0.002), but was not predicted during pre- or postexercise. CONCLUSION: Quantification of TWA enhances its capacity for determination of the risk for total and cardiovascular mortality and SCD in low-risk populations. Its prognostic power is superior during exercise compared to preexercise or postexercise.",M1
19171855,"Determinants of prolonged QT interval and their contribution to sudden death risk in coronary artery disease: the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study.BACKGROUND: In a recent cohort study, prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) was associated with an independent increased risk of sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>). We evaluated determinants of prolonged QTc and the relationship of prolonged QTc to SCD risk among patients with coronary artery disease in the general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control design was used. Cases were SCD patients with coronary artery disease among a metropolitan area of 1 000 000 residents (2002 to 2006); controls were area residents with coronary artery disease but no history of SCD. All cases were required to have an ECG suitable for QTc analysis before and unrelated to the occurrence of SCD. A total of 373 cases and 309 controls met criteria for analysis. Mean QTc was significantly longer in cases than in controls (450+/-45 versus 433+/-37 ms; P&lt;0.0001). In a multivariate model, gender, diabetes mellitus, and QTc-prolonging drugs were significant determinants of QTc prolongation in controls. In a logistic regression model predicting SCD, diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 2.96) and use of QTc-prolonging drugs (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 4.37) were significant predictors of SCD among subjects with normal or borderline QTc. However, abnormally prolonged QTc in the absence of diabetes and QT-prolonging medications was the strongest predictor of SCD (odds ratio, 5.53; 95% confidence interval, 3.20 to 9.57). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus and QTc-affecting drugs determined QTc prolongation and were predictors of SCD in coronary artery disease. However, idiopathic abnormal QTc prolongation was associated with 5-fold increased odds of SCD. A continued search for novel determinants of QTc prolongation such as genomic factors is likely to enhance risk stratification for SCD in coronary artery disease.",M1
19168396,"Evidence regarding clinical use of microvolt T-wave alternans.BACKGROUND: Microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing in many studies has proven to be a highly accurate predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (VTEs) in patients with risk factors for sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) but without a prior history of sustained VTEs (primary prevention patients). In some recent studies involving primary prevention patients with prophylactically implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), MTWA has not performed as well. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the hypothesis that MTWA is an accurate predictor of VTEs in primary prevention patients without implanted ICDs, but not of appropriate ICD therapy in such patients with implanted ICDs. METHODS: This study identified prospective clinical trials evaluating MTWA measured using the spectral analytic method in primary prevention populations and analyzed studies in which: (1) few patients had implanted ICDs and as a result none or a small fraction (&lt; or =15%) of the reported end point VTEs were appropriate ICD therapies (low ICD group), or (2) many of the patients had implanted ICDs and the majority of the reported end point VTEs were appropriate ICD therapies (high ICD group). RESULTS: In the low ICD group comprising 3,682 patients, the hazard ratio associated with a nonnegative versus negative MTWA test was 13.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.5 to 30.4) and the annual event rate among the MTWA-negative patients was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1% to 0.5%). In contrast, in the high ICD group comprising 2,234 patients, the hazard ratio was only 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1) and the annual event rate among the MTWA-negative patients was elevated to 5.4% (95% CI: 4.1% to 6.7%). In support of these findings, we analyzed published data from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Trial II (MADIT II) and Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) trials and determined that in those trials only 32% of patients who received appropriate ICD therapy averted an SCD. CONCLUSION: This study found that MTWA testing using the spectral analytic method provides an accurate means of predicting VTEs in primary prevention patients without implanted ICDs; in particular, the event rate is very low among such patients with a negative MTWA test. In prospective trials of ICD therapy, the number of patients receiving appropriate ICD therapy greatly exceeds the number of patients who avert SCD as a result of ICD therapy. In trials involving patients with implanted ICDs, these excess appropriate ICD therapies seem to distribute randomly between MTWA-negative and MTWA-nonnegative patients, obscuring the predictive accuracy of MTWA for SCD. Appropriate ICD therapy is an unreliable surrogate end point for SCD.",M1
19168395,"Explaining the clinical manifestations of T wave alternans in patients at risk for sudden cardiac death.The mechanisms underlying sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) are complex and diverse. Therefore, correct application of any marker to risk stratify patients for appropriate therapy requires knowledge regarding how the marker is reflective of a particular electroanatomical substrate for arrhythmias. Noninvasive measurement of beat-to-beat alternation of the electrocardiographic T-wave, referred to as T-wave alternans (TWA), is an important marker of risk for SCD. Is this relationship a mere association, or is TWA mechanistically linked to SCD? Recent experimental evidence strongly supports a mechanistic relationship between TWA and SCD. This review considers the underlying mechanisms of TWA derived from experimental studies, as they relate to clinical observations of TWA in humans, addressing the following questions derived from common clinical observations: (1) Where does TWA on the surface electrocardiogram come from? (2) Why is controlled heart rate elevation required to elicit TWA? (3) Why is TWA associated with risk for SCD? (4) Why is TWA associated with a broad range of ventricular arrhythmias? (5) How do commonly used medications affect TWA?",M1
19167272,"Druggable targets for sudden cardiac death prevention: lessons from the past and strategies for the future.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is most commonly caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). The single largest cohort of victims is the population with little or no prior overt heart disease. Effective prevention will require long-term prophylaxis by drugs in large numbers of people identified by risk factors. This means that safe as well as effective drugs are required. Drugs with overt effects on cardiac electrophysiology have failed in the clinic owing to poor effectiveness and/or adverse effects. This article examines possible new drug targets. We have focused on acute myocardial ischaemia as it is the most strikingly proarrhythmic pathology, and the most common cause of coronary artery disease-related VF and SCD according to inferences from epidemiology, drug trials and decades of animal research. To set the scene we have briefly explored drugs that have failed in the clinic in order to identify possible targets that have been overlooked or underexploited. We conclude that the best strategy is identification of pathology-specific targets that render drugs active only where and when their action is required.",M1
19148838,"Prevention of sudden cardiac death with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.AIM: To systematically review trials concerning the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>), cardiac death, and all-cause mortality in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database (1966-2007) were searched. We identified randomized controlled trials that compared dietary or supplementary intake of omega-3 fatty acids with control diet or placebo in CHD patients. Eligible studies had at least 6 months of follow-up data, and cited SCD as an end-point. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality. Meta-analysis of relative risk was carried out using the random effect model. RESULTS: Eight trials were identified, comprising 20,997 patients. In patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), omega-3 fatty acids reduced relative risk (RR) of SCD (RR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.20-0.91). In patients with angina, omega-3 fatty acids increased RR of SCD (RR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.01-1.92). Overall, RR for cardiac death and all-cause mortality were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.50-1.00) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58-1.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reduces the incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with MI, but may have adverse effects in angina patients.",M1
19144665,"Advances in the prevention of sudden cardiac death in the young.Sudden cardiac death (<e>SCD</e>) is a tragic and devastating complication of a number of cardiovascular diseases. Although coronary artery disease accounts for a majority of these deaths across all ages, many other aetiologies contribute to this problem when it occurs in the young (age &lt; or = 35 years), where coronary artery disease is far less common. Specifically, genetic heart disorders are an important cause of SCD in the young. While pharmacological therapies have made some impact on prevention of SCD, the introduction of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been the single major advance in the prevention of SCD in the young. In addition, the awareness that most causes of SCD in the young are inherited, means family screening of relatives of young SCD victims allows identification of previously unrecognised at-risk individuals thereby enabling prevention of SCD in relatives. The role of genetic testing, both in living affected individuals and in the setting of a 'molecular autopsy', is emerging as a key factor in early diagnosis of an underlying cardiovascular genetic disorder. Understanding the genetic basis of SCD, investigating the molecular mechanisms that lead from the gene defect to the clinical phenotype, and elucidating the specific environmental triggers for SCD, will most likely lead to further key improvements in the prevention of SCD in the young.",M1

20486179,"Elevated soluble transferrin receptor levels reflect increased erythropoietic drive rather than iron deficiency in pediatric sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The prevalence of iron deficiency in pediatric sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is difficult to describe because standard markers of iron metabolism are altered in this inflammatory state. Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is an alternative marker of iron utilization. Our primary objective was to evaluate the utility of sTfR as a biomarker of hemolysis and erythropoietic drive versus iron metabolism in SCD. PROCEDURE: In a prospective cohort study, we screened 51 children with SCD at steady state with markers of iron status and sTfR. Iron deficient patients were treated with ferrous sulfate for 6 weeks, followed by repeat testing. RESULTS: At baseline, there was stronger correlation between sTfR and markers of hemolysis and erythropoietic drive, including hemoglobin (Spearman's r = -0.67, P &lt; or = 0.001) and reticulocyte count (Spearman's r = 0.59, P &lt; or = 0.001), than with markers of iron metabolism, such as transferrin saturation (TS; Spearman's r = 0.33, P = 0.02) and ferritin (Spearman's r = 0.17, P = 0.26). Eleven (21%) of the 51 children were identified as iron deficient. For treated patients, response to iron therapy was variable, although all patients had a significant increase (mean 11 +/- 3.9%, P = 0.001) in TS. CONCLUSIONS: sTfR activity is a stronger biomarker of hemolysis and erythropoietic drive than of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in pediatric SCD. Low TS was most suggestive of iron deficiency and an increase in TS represented the most consistent indicator of response to iron supplementation.",M2
20466235,"Bacterial blood cultures in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) are considered at risk for bacteremia, especially when they present to the emergency department (ED) with fever. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the incidence of bacteremia in children with SCD presenting with or without fever to a pediatric ED. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 692 pediatric ED visits of children with SCD during a 2-year period was conducted. RESULTS: Seven blood cultures (6 homozygous and 1 heterozygous) had bacterial growth (1.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.1), 3 of which were among febrile children (1.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3.6). All identified microorganisms are part of the normal skin or oral flora and could represent contamination. None of the patients had growth of the Streptococcus pneumoniae species. CONCLUSION: A very low rate of bacterial growth and no S pneumoniae were found. The absence of S pneumoniae in our cohort can be associated with the addition of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.",M2
20460105,"Induced expression of bone morphogenetic protein-6 and Smads signaling in human monocytes derived dendritic cells during sickle-cell pathology with orthopedic complications.BMP-SMAD (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling pathways in association with APT play paramount roles in osteoblastic differentiation, bone formation and embryonic development of human and animals. However, the implications of potent components (BMP6, Smad1, Smad2 and APT) of this pathway in <e>SCD</e> (sickle cell disease) pathology with orthopedic complications (Ortho+SS) are poorly elucidated and substantially unknown. Here, we address the role of BMP6, Smad1, Smad2 and APT mRNA and protein expression in hMDDCs obtained from Ortho+SS patients, employing RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Interestingly, we observed that SCD pathology exhibited significantly up-regulated expression of those signaling components at the level of mRNA and protein. Furthermore, exogenous BMP6 induced apoptosis was observed to be significantly associated in Ortho+SS complication and markedly increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis as compared to healthy group. Interestingly, the non-stimulated cells have shown higher apoptotic nuclei percentage than the stimulated cells in pathological condition. Thus, expression of BMP-SMAD signaling components augments apoptosis and up regulates the transcription of these genes and it suggests that induction is due to transcriptional regulation. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that BMP-SMAD signaling components along with APT were over expressed, mediates apoptosis and may play an important role in the SCD pathology with orthopedic complications.",M2
20443473,"Segmentation and quantification of pulmonary artery for noninvasive CT assessment of sickle cell secondary pulmonary hypertension.PURPOSE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease that results in high mortality and morbidity in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients. PAH diagnosis is invasive via right heart catheterization, but manual measurements of the main pulmonary artery (PA) diameters from computed tomography (CT) have shown promise as noninvasive surrogate marker of PAH. The authors propose a semiautomated computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) tool to quantify the main PA size from pulmonary CT angiography (CTA). METHODS: A follow-up retrospective study investigated the potential of CT and image analysis to quantify the presence of PAH secondary to SCD based on PA size. The authors segmented the main pulmonary arteries using a combination of fast marching level sets and geodesic active contours from smoothed pulmonary CTA images of 20 SCD patients with proven PAH by right heart catheterization and 20 matched negative controls. From the PA segmentation, a Euclidean distance map was calculated and an algorithm based on fast marching methods was used to compute subvoxel precise centerlines of the PA trunk (PT) and main left/right PA (PM). Maximum distentions of PT and PM were automatically quantified using the centerline and validated with manual measurements from two observers. RESULTS: The pulmonary trunk and main were significantly larger (p &lt; 0.001) in PAH/SCD patients (33.73 +/- 3.92 mm for PT and 25.17 +/- 2.90 for PM) than controls (27.03 +/- 2.94 mm for PT and 20.62 +/- 3.06 for PM). The discrepancy was qualitatively improved when vessels' diameters were normalized by body surface area (p &lt; 0.001). The validation of the method showed high correlation (mean R=0.9 for PT and R = 0.91 for PM) and Bland-Altman agreement (0.4 +/- 3.6 mm for PT and 0.5 +/- 2.9 mm for PM) between CAD and manual measurements. Quantification errors were comparable to intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD measurements between two different users were robust and reproducible with correlations of R = 0.99 for both PT and PM and Bland-Altman agreements of -0.13 +/- 1.33 mm for PT and -0.08 +/- 0.84 mm for PM. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the semiautomated quantification of pulmonary artery has sufficient accuracy and reproducibility for clinical use. CT with image processing and extraction of PA biomarkers show great potential as a surrogate indicator for diagnosis or quantification of PAH, and could be an important tool for drug discovery and noninvasive clinical surveillance.",M2
20385437,"Disclosure and sickle cell disorder: a mixed methods study of the young person with sickle cell at school.Sickle cell is a leading genetic condition, both globally and in England. Little research has been conducted into the experiences of young people with sickle cell at school. A mixed methods study (May 2007-September 2008) based on 569 questionnaires and 40 taped interviews with young people living with sickle cell disorder (<e>SCD</e>) in England found that students with SCD are faced with a dilemma as to whether or not to disclose their sickle cell to teachers and pupils: the latent and hidden characteristics of their symptoms make it possible, in Goffmanesque terms, to  pass . However the variable and unpredictable course of sickle cell is a reminder of Goffman's notion of being  discreditable . We found that teacher or pupil knowledge that a young person has sickle cell is not statistically associated with reported better treatment of young people with SCD at school. Analysis of interviews suggests most young people favour disclosing their sickle cell status (on the basis that teachers will then know what actions to take in the face of bouts of illness and in terms of making allowances for illness or school absences). A minority disagreed because disclosure was felt to attract unwarranted attention or disabling attitudes. Attitudes to disclosing to peers were more varied: either for or against disclosure to peers, or ambivalent in that they felt a tension between acknowledging the reality of their sickle cell, and not wanting it to be a central part of their identity. Some health promotion advice appears to assume that teacher and/or peer awareness is the key to improving school experience for young people with SCD, but this is not borne out by this study. Rather a change in wider school environments is required such that young people with SCD are supported irrespective of whether they themselves foreground or play down their disabled identity.",M2
20370779,"Adult emergency department patients with sickle cell pain crisis: a learning collaborative model to improve analgesic management.OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to report the baseline (prior to quality improvement interventions) patient and visit characteristics and analgesic management practices for each site participating in an emergency department (ED) sickle cell learning collaborative. METHODS: A prospective, multisite longitudinal cohort study in the context of a learning-collaborative model was performed in three midwestern EDs. Each site formed a multidisciplinary team charged with improving analgesic management for patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Each team developed a nurse-initiated analgesic protocol for SCD patients (implemented after a baseline data collection period of 3.5 months at one site and 10 months at the other two sites). All sites prospectively enrolled adults with an acute pain crisis and SCD. All medical records for patients meeting study criteria were reviewed. Demographic, health services, and analgesic management data were abstracted, including ED visit frequency data, ED disposition, arrival and discharge pain score, and name and route of initial analgesic administered. Ten interviews per quarter per site were conducted with patients within 14 days of their ED discharge, and subjects were queried about the highest level of pain acceptable at discharge. The primary outcome variable was the time to initial analgesic administration. Variable data were described as means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for nonnormal data. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients met study criteria (median age = 32 years, IQR = 24-40 years) with a total of 701 ED visits. Eighty-six interviews were conducted. Most patients (71.6%) had between one and three visits to the ED during the study period. However, after removing Site 3 from the analysis because of the short data enrollment period (3.5 months), which influenced the mean number of visits for the entire cohort, 52% of patients had between one and three ED visits over 10 months, 21% had four to nine visits, and 27% had between 10 and 67 visits. Fifty-nine percent of patients were discharged home. The median time to initial analgesic for the cohort was 74 minutes (IQR = 48-135 minutes). Differences between choice of analgesic agent and route selected were evident between sites. For the cohort, 680 initial analgesic doses were given (morphine sulfate, 42%; hydromorphone, 46%; meperidine, 4%; morphine sulfate and ibuprofen or ketorolac, 7%) using the following routes: oral (2%), intravenous (67%), subcutaneous (3%), and intramuscular (28%). Patients reported a significantly lower targeted discharge pain score (mean +/- SD = 4.19 +/- 1.18) compared to the actual documented discharge pain score within 45 minutes of discharge (mean +/- SD = 5.77 +/- 2.45; mean difference = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = .723 to 2.44, n = 43). CONCLUSIONS: While half of the patients had one to three ED visits during the study period, many patients had more frequent visits. Delays to receiving an initial analgesic were common, and post-ED interviews reveal that sickle cell pain patients are discharged from the ED with higher pain scores than what they perceive as desirable.",M2
20331960,"Developing a global agenda for sickle cell disease: report of an international symposium and workshop in Cotonou, Republic of Benin.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is one of the most common monogenetic diseases worldwide. Although there have been some advances in the management of SCD in high-income countries, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic diversity of the disease. In low-income countries, basic facilities for management are lacking, systematic screening is not common practice, and diagnosis is made late. The case has been made for the need to develop long-term partnerships between SCD clinicians and researchers in high- and low-income countries in order to further research and improve clinical care globally. In response to this critical need, a meeting of SCD experts from around the world was held in Cotonou, Republic of Benin, on January 26-29, 2009. The meeting was entitled  Advancing Sickle Cell Disease Patient Care Through Global Research.  In addition to plenary sessions, small study groups discussed the following topics: the natural history of SCD in Africa and elsewhere, neonatal screening programs, infectious diseases in SCD, hydroxyurea therapy in Africa and other regions, and genetic factors involved in phenotypic diversity. A roundtable discussion on experience with collaborative programs to establish SCD centers in low-income countries highlighted steps that are necessary to establish these programs and the problems that have been encountered. During a session on capacity building, small study groups consisting of participants from low-, middle-, and high-income countries discussed collaborations for the identification, clinical care, and study of SCD patients in low-income countries. There was agreement to establish the Global Sickle Cell Disease Network to foster a global community to advance the clinical care and study of patients with SCD. The next meeting of the network will take place in Accra, Ghana, on July 20-23, 2010.",M2
20331958,"Administrative data sets and health services research on hemoglobinopathies: a review of the literature.CONTEXT: Large administrative healthcare data sets are an important source of data for health services research on sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and thalassemia. This paper identifies and describes major U.S. healthcare administrative databases and their use in published health services research on hemoglobinopathies. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Publications that used U.S. administrative healthcare data sets to assess healthcare use or expenditures were identified through PubMed searches using key words for SCD and either costs, expenditures, or hospital discharges; no additional articles were identified by using thalassemia as a key word. Additional articles were identified through manual searches of related articles or reference lists. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 26 original health services research articles were identified. The types of administrative data used for health services research on hemoglobinopathies included federal- and state-specific hospital discharge data sets and public and private health insurance claims databases. Gaps in recent health services research on hemoglobin disorders included a paucity of research related to thalassemia, few studies of adults with hemoglobinopathies, and few studies focusing on emergency department or outpatient clinic use. CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data sets provide a unique means to study healthcare use among people with SCD or thalassemia because of the ability to examine large sample sizes at fairly low cost, resulting in greater generalizability than is the case with clinic-based data. Limitations of administrative data in general include potential misclassification, under-reporting, and lack of sociodemographic information.",M2
20331957,"Sickle cell disease-related pediatric medical expenditures in the U.S.BACKGROUND: Although it is known that people with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) have relatively high utilization of medical care, most previous estimates of SCD-attributable expenditures have been limited to either inpatient care or single-state data. PURPOSE: To extend known findings by measuring the attributable or incremental expenditures per child with SCD compared to children without this illness and to thereby estimate SCD-attributable expenditures among children in the U.S. METHODS: MarketScan Medicaid and Commercial Claims databases for 2005 were used to estimate total medical expenditures of children with and without SCD. Expenditures attributable to SCD were calculated as the difference in age-adjusted mean expenditures during 2005 for children with SCD relative to children without SCD in the two databases. RESULTS: Children with SCD incurred medical expenditures that were $9369 and $13,469 higher than those of children without SCD enrolled in Medicaid and private insurance, respectively. In other words, expenditures of children with SCD were 6 and 11 times those of children without SCD enrolled in Medicaid and private insurance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using a large, multistate, multipayer patient sample, SCD-attributable medical expenditures in children were conservatively and approximately estimated at $335 million in 2005.",M2
20331956,"Sickle cell disease and pregnancy outcomes: women of African descent.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is a severe hematologic condition that presents unique complications among affected pregnant women. Many studies of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with SCD are limited by small samples or fail to consider important risk factors. PURPOSE: This study compared perinatal outcomes among women of African ancestry with and without SCD in a large, population-based sample. METHODS: Data from the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) Data System were analyzed during June-August 2009 to identify in-state deliveries to resident women of African descent. Logistic regression analyses compared perinatal outcomes for deliveries among women with and without SCD, adjusted for maternal age, education, parity, plurality, insurance status, adequacy of prenatal care, smoking during pregnancy, and infant gender. RESULTS: During 1998-2006, there were 116,076 deliveries to 84,561 women; SCD prevalence was 0.6%. Adjusted odds of fetal death among deliveries to women with SCD were 2.2 times those among women without SCD (95% CI=1.2, 4.2). Compared to women without SCD, the odds of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and having babies small for gestational age (SGA) among women with SCD were 1.5 (95% CI=1.2, 1.8); 1.7 (95% CI=1.1, 2.6); and 1.3 (95% CI=1.0, 1.7), respectively. Sickle cell disease was positively associated with cesarean delivery and inductions. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based linked data systems are useful for assessing risks of adverse health outcomes among women with specific medical conditions, such as SCD. Women with SCD should seek preconception care to identify and modify risk behaviors and receive counseling regarding potential adverse sequelae associated with pregnancy-related morbidity and preterm delivery.",M2
20331955,"Emergency department visits made by patients with sickle cell disease: a descriptive study, 1999-2007.BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) often use emergency department services to obtain medical care. Limited information is available about emergency department use among patients with SCD. PURPOSE: This study assessed characteristics of emergency department visits made nationally by patients with SCD. METHODS: Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for the years 1999-2007 were analyzed. The NHAMCS is a survey of hospital emergency department and outpatient visits. Emergency department visits by patients with SCD were identified using ICD-9-CM codes, and nationally weighted estimates were calculated. RESULTS: On average, approximately 197,333 emergency department visits were estimated to have occurred each year between 1999 and 2007 with SCD as one of the diagnoses listed. The expected source of payment was private insurance for 14%, Medicaid/State Children's Health Insurance Program for 58%, Medicare for 14%, and other/unknown for 15%. Approximately 29% of visits resulted in hospital admission; this was 37% among patients aged 0-19 years, and 26% among patients aged &gt;/=20 years. The episode of care was indicated as a follow-up visit for 23% of the visits. Patient-cited reasons for the emergency department visit included chest pain (11%); other pain or unspecified pain (67%); fever/infection (6%); and shortness of breath/breathing problem/cough (5%), among other reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial numbers of emergency department visits occur among people with SCD. The most common reason for the emergency department visits is pain symptoms. The findings of this study can help to improve health services delivery and utilization among patients with SCD.",M2
20331954,"Health status and healthcare use in a national sample of children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of population-based data describing health status and use of health services among children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). PURPOSE: This study provides estimates of co-occurring conditions, health impact and utilization, and barriers to care for a national sample of children with SCD. METHODS: Data were derived from the 1997-2005 National Health Interview Survey Child Sample Core. The study included 192 children aged 0-17 years with SCD whose race was reported as black or African-American, and 19,335 children without SCD of the same age and race. Parents or other knowledgeable adults reported on medical and developmental conditions, health status, and healthcare use and access. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic characteristics, black children with SCD had higher odds of frequent severe headaches or migraines, intellectual disabilities, regular use of prescription medication, and fair or poor health status compared with black children without SCD. While healthcare and special education services use were generally higher for black children with SCD than for black children in the general population, those with SCD also had higher odds of reporting delays in accessing health care. CONCLUSIONS: The health burden for children with SCD and their families is profound and may be exacerbated by barriers to accessing comprehensive medical care. Additional study of the extent of unmet needs for U.S. children with SCD is warranted.",M2
20331952,"Population estimates of sickle cell disease in the U.S.BACKGROUND: The number of individuals with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) in the U.S. is unknown. Determination of burden of disease, healthcare issues, and policies is best served by representative estimations of the SCD population. PURPOSE: To update SCD population estimates by using recent U.S. Census and birth-cohort SCD prevalence for at-risk populations as available through the centralized reporting of universal newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies, with an effort to demonstrate the potential effect of early mortality. METHODS: National and state SCD populations were estimated based on the 2008 U.S. Census, using total, African-American, and Hispanic birth-cohort disease prevalence derived from the National Newborn Screening Information System. Estimates were corrected for early mortality for sickle cell anemia using data from the CDC's Compressed Mortality Report and published patient-cohort survival information. RESULTS: National SCD population estimates ranged from 104,000 to 138,900, based on birth-cohort disease prevalence, but from 72,000 to 98,000 when corrected for early mortality. Several limitations were noted in the available data, particularly for SCD mortality in adults. CONCLUSIONS: The number of individuals with SCD in the U.S. may approach 100,000, even when accounting for the effect of early mortality on estimations. A paucity of high-quality data limits appropriate estimation. State-to-state variability may preclude application of state-specific information to other states or to the nation as a whole. Standardized collection and centralized reporting, a surveillance system, will be necessary to assess the size and composition of the U.S. SCD population.",M2
20351105,"Placenta growth factor (PlGF), a novel inducer of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>).Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a prothrombotic state. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to modulate fibrinolysis, lung injury/fibrosis, and angiogenesis. However, its role in SCD is less understood, and the molecular mechanisms underlying increased PAI-1 are unknown. Herein, we show a novel link between PAI-1 and sickle erythropoiesis. Plasma PAI-1 levels were high in SCD patients at steady state and in two humanized sickle mouse models, with increased PAI-1 immunolabeling in sickle mouse lung, bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Placenta growth factor (PlGF), released at high levels by sickle erythroblasts, induced PAI-1 expression in primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and monocytes through activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), NADPH oxidase, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Analysis of the human PAI-1 promoter revealed this induction was mediated by hypoxia-response element (HRE)-1, HRE-2, and distal activator protein (AP-1) sites. We also identify the involvement of c-Jun, c-Jun/c-Fos, and JunD, but not JunB, in binding with AP-1 sites of the PAI-1 promoter upon PlGF induction. Consistent with these findings, levels of PAI-1 were low in PlGF knock-out mice and sickle-PlGF knock-out mice; overexpression of PlGF in normal mice increased circulating PAI-1. In conclusion, we identify a novel mechanism of PAI-1 elevation in SCD.",M2
20306733,"Influence of pregnancy on bone mass in sickle cell anemia.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) causes osteopenia and osteoporosis, This osteopenia may be further influenced by pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To find out the effect of pregnancy on bone skeleton density in patients with SCD. METHODS: Consecutive adult female SCA patients who were treated at the out-patients clinics of King Fahd University Hospital Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, between January and July 2007, were the cases of study. Patient's age, number of pregnancies and duration after pregnancy were documented. Weight and height were recorded to calculate body mass index (BMI). Blood was collected for haematology and biochemistry purposes. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement was done using dual energy X-ray absorbtiometry (DEXA) at upper femur and lumbar spine. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were evaluated. There were 20 (52.6%) patients who were delivered in (Group A) and 18 (47.4%) who were nulliparous in Group B. The average age in group A was 27.55 +/- 4.9 years while group B was 26.30 +/- 2.1 years. Thirteen (65%) of the patients in group A were osteoporotic when compared to five (27.7%) in group B (p=0.01). Osteopenic patients in group B were seven (38.9%) versus four (20%) in group A (p=0.2). Osteoporosis in both groups was highest at lumbar spine compared to the hip region (P=0.001). BMD was lower in parous women when compared to the nulliparous women. There was no significant difference in haematological parameters which included the percentage of sickle hemoglobin, hemoglobin level between normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic patient. CONCLUSION: This study shows that SCA female patients suffer from low bone mass in young age. Pregnancy predisposes the SCA patients to further osteopenia and osteoporosis.",M2
20230401,"Lipid levels in sickle-cell disease associated with haemolytic severity, vascular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is an emerging and important clinical problem. In a single-institution adult cohort of 365 patients, we investigated lipid and lipoprotein levels and their relationship to markers of intravascular haemolysis, vascular dysfunction and PH. In agreement with prior studies, we confirm significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in SCD versus ethnically-matched healthy controls. Several cholesterol parameters correlated significantly with markers of anaemia, but not endothelial activation or PH. More importantly, serum triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in SCD compared to controls. Elevated triglyceride levels correlated significantly with markers of haemolysis (lactate dehydrogenase and arginase; both P &lt; 0.0005), endothelial activation (soluble E-selectin, P &lt; 0.0001; soluble P-selectin, P = 0.02; soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, P = 0.01), inflammation (leucocyte count, P = 0.0004; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, P = 0.02) and PH (amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, P = 0.002; prevalence of elevated tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV), P &lt; 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, triglyceride levels correlated independently with elevated TRV (P = 0.002). Finally, forearm blood flow studies in adult patients with SCD demonstrated a significant association between increased triglyceride/HDL-C ratio and endothelial dysfunction (P &lt; 0.05). These results characterize elevated plasma triglyceride levels as a potential risk factor for PH in SCD.",M2
20216336,"Hydroxycarbamide stimulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells: relevance to sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The clinical hallmarks of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) are vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) triggered by red blood cells (RBC) stiffening and abnormal adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (VEC) in the context of chronic inflammation, cell activation, and vascular tone abnormalities. Hydroxycarbamide (HC) is the only drug with a proven efficacy in decreasing VOC frequency. HC decreases RBC stiffening, modulates adhesion protein expression by RBC and VEC, and reduces endothelin-1 production by VEC. Our objective was to test whether HC could also affect inflammation through its action on VEC. METHODS: We used microarrays to study the effect of HC on the transcriptome of transformed human bone marrow endothelial cell, a cell line derived from bone marrow microcirculation (the predilection site of VOC), in basal and proinflammatory conditions. Microarray results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR and protein analysis on transformed human bone marrow endothelial cell (TrHBMEC) and on two other VEC types in the primary culture: human pulmonary microcirculation endothelial cell (HPMEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC a classical model for the macrocirculation). RESULTS: HC had a significant effect on the expression of genes of the 'inflammation pathway'. Strikingly, it stimulates the expression of proinflammatory genes such as IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, and CCL8 in all the tested VEC types. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that VECs are significant targets of HC in the context of SCD and identifies its earlier unsuspected action on another major component of SCD pathophysiology, that is, the 'inflammation pathway'.",M2
20213846,"Parental attitudes toward research participation in pediatric sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Socio-cultural attitudes and perceptions are commonly cited barriers to the recruitment of African-Americans for medical research, yet no studies have examined the factors influencing research participation among individuals with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) or caregivers of children with SCD. PROCEDURE: We distributed a 32-item, self-administered survey to parents or legal guardians of children with SCD over a 6-month period. We used Pearson's chi-square to determine factors associated with a favorable attitude toward research participation and logistic regression to determine independent associations. RESULTS: We collected 151 surveys in this pilot study. In general, 86% of respondents believed more research needed to be done for SCD and 57% would allow their child to participate in a medical research study, corresponding to a favorable attitude. Respondent belief that more research needed to be done for SCD (OR 23.4, 95% CI 4.5-121.9, P = 0.001), perception of greater severity of their own child's SCD (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0-7.1, P = 0.041) and prior exposure to research (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.0-10.3, P = 0.043) were significantly associated with a favorable attitude, although only the first two remained independent associations in our regression model. Attitude toward research participation was not affected by respondent country of birth. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children with SCD who allow participation in medical research are likely to believe that more research is needed in SCD and that their child's SCD is moderate to severe. Developing effective tools, based on identified knowledge gaps related to clinical research, may improve research participation in this population.",M2
20207263,"History and current status of newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies.The impact of hemoglobinopathies on healthcare in the United States, particularly sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), has been significant. Enactment of the Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act in 1972 significantly increased the federal interest in the SCDs and other hemoglobinopathies. Only since May 1, 2006, have all states required and provided universal newborn screening for SCD despite a national recommendation to this effect in 1987. In this article, we review the history of screening for SCD and other hemoglobinopathies, along with federal and state activities that have contributed to improved health outcomes for patients with SCD, as well as current newborn screening practices. We also chronicle the federal activities that have helped to shape and to refine laboratory screening and diagnostic proficiency. Finally, we review molecular testing strategies that have evolved and outline their possible future impacts on disease detection and outcome improvement.",M2
20196930,"Ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. The increase in life expectancy of SCD patients in recent years has led to the emergence of more complications of the disease, e.g. ocular, which in the past were uncommon. This review describes current knowledge of the ocular manifestations of patients with SCD. SCD can affect virtually every vascular bed in the eye and can cause blindness in the advanced stages. The most significant ocular changes are those which occur in the fundus, which can be grouped into proliferative sickle retinopathy, and non-proliferative retinal changes based on the presence of vascular proliferation. This distinction is important because the formation of new vessels is the single most important precursor of potentially blinding complications. Although various systemic complications of SCD are known to be more common in patients with the Hb SS genotype, visual impairment secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy is more common in patients with the Hb SC genotype. There is also an increase with age in the incidence and prevalence rates of all ocular complications of SCD. It is therefore recommended that all patients with SCD undergo periodic ophthalmological screening from the age of 10 years.",M2
20194891,"Improved survival of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.The survival of young children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) has improved, but less is known about older children and adolescents. We studied the Dallas Newborn Cohort (DNC) to estimate contemporary 18-year survival for newborns with SCD and document changes in the causes and ages of death over time. We also explored whether improvements in the quality of medical care were temporally associated with survival. The DNC now includes 940 subjects with 8857 patient-years of follow-up. Most children with sickle cell anemia (93.9%) and nearly all children with milder forms of SCD (98.4%) now live to become adults. The incidence of death and the pattern of mortality changed over the duration of the cohort. Sepsis is no longer the leading cause of death. All the recent deaths in the cohort occurred in patients 18 years or older, most shortly after the transition to adult care. Quality of care in the DNC has improved over time, with significantly more timely initial visits and preventive interventions for young children. In summary, most children with SCD now survive the childhood years, but young adults who transition to adult medical care are at high risk for early death.",M2
20180627,"Auditory-evoked response analysis in Brazilian patients with sickle cell disease.The objective of the present study was to evaluate the integrity of the peripheral and central auditory systems of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients, through electrophysiological evaluation utilizing auditory evoked potentials, and comparing the results obtained in SCD patients with individuals without SCD. A total of 80 individuals were evaluated: 40 SCD patients; and 40 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) was used to check neural integrity and electrophysiological thresholds, and cognitive potential (P300) to analyse the auditory selective attention. Despite the exclusion of individuals with comorbidities typical of SCD, the predominance of hearing loss among the patients was detected in 16 ears (20%). The absolute latencies of the BAER were within the expected range but the SCD group showed a small but statistically significant reduction of the interpeaks I-V, indicative of cochlear alteration. P300 latency and amplitude were adequate for both groups suggesting the absence of central auditory system abnormalities. The present findings suggest that SCD causes variable degree of cochlear abnormalities without evidence of neural problems.",M2
20175775,"Exercise capacity and haemodynamics in patients with sickle cell disease with pulmonary hypertension treated with bosentan: results of the ASSET studies.Doppler-defined pulmonary hypertension (PH) in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is associated with 40% mortality at 40 months. To assess the effect of bosentan in SCD-PH, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week studies were initiated. Safety concerns are particularly relevant in SCD due to comorbid conditions. ASSET-1 and -2 enrolled patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary venous hypertension (PH), respectively. Haemodynamics and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were obtained at baseline and week 16. The studies were terminated due to slow site initiation and patient enrolment (n = 26). Bosentan appeared to be well tolerated. Although sample sizes were limited, in ASSET-1 at baseline, 6MWD correlated with cardiac output (CO; P = 0.006) with non-significant inverse correlations between 6MWD and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; P = 0.07) and between 6MWD and right atrial pressure (P = 0.08). In ASSET-2 at baseline, there was a non-significant correlation between 6MWD and CO (P = 0.06). Due to limited sample sizes, efficacy endpoints were not analysed. However, in both studies, non-significant increases in CO were observed with bosentan compared to placebo. Similarly, non-significant decreases in PVR were observed with bosentan. Limited data in SCD-PH suggest that a low 6MWD predicts a low CO. Standard-dose bosentan appears to be well tolerated. Further investigation is warranted.

20173433,"A comparison of analgesic management for emergency department patients with sickle cell disease and renal colic.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is a difference in time to initial analgesic for patients with acute pain from sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) versus renal colic (RC) and to identify factors contributing to variance in time to analgesic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of the adult emergency department (ED) patients with acute pain from SCD and RC in an urban ED (final ED discharge ICD-9 diagnosis codes were included). A structured medical record review abstracted the demographics, arrival shift, triage level, initial pain score, triage time, and time of initial analgesic dose. Data were compared with Kaplan-Meier plots of time to initial analgesic for both RC and SCD with the log-rank test to test for differences by disease category. A multivariable Cox regression model estimated differences in time to initial analgesic by disease category while controlling for other possible confounders. RESULTS: Median time to initial analgesic was 80 minutes for patients with SCD (interquartile range, 48 to 145) versus 50 minutes for patients with RC (interquartile range: 30 to 96). Patients with SCD reported a higher pain score on arrival when compared with RC patients and were more frequently assigned a higher triage priority level (P=0.05). Covariates that contributed the most delays to the model were afternoon arrival [hazard ratio (HR): 0.35, P&lt;0.01], low acuity triage level (HR: 0.42, P&lt;0.01), SCD diagnosis (HR: 0.61, P&lt;0.01), and inability to obtain intravenous access (HR: 0.71, P=0.01). DISCUSSION: ED patients with SCD experienced longer delays in the administration of the initial analgesic compared with RC patients, despite higher arrival pain scores and triage acuity levels.",M2
20173269,"Examining the effectiveness of hydroxyurea in people with sickle cell disease.This study investigated hydroxyurea use in people with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) outside of a research setting. Pharmacy data, outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and length of stay were assessed for all patients with SCD enrolled in a Medicaid managed care organization in Maryland. Three hundred and ninety (390) people with SCD were covered between the years 2001-2005. A large majority (85.9%) never had a claim for a hydroxyurea refill. Hydroxyurea users had higher admission rates than non-hydroxyurea users (5 vs. 1.5, p=.004). Patients who were in the highest tertile of refills of hydroxyurea had significantly fewer hospital admissions than patients in the lowest tertile (2.44 vs. 7.57, p=.043). Patients with the lowest hydroxyurea refill usage had significantly higher mean costs per month enrolled than those with the highest number ($4,553 vs. $2,017, p=.031). Hydroxyurea was underutilized in this patient population. Patients with more regular refills of hydroxyurea had fewer admissions to the hospital and markedly decreased costs.",M2
20158132,"Patient-reported outcomes: descriptors of nociceptive and neuropathic pain and barriers to effective pain management in adult outpatients with sickle cell disease.Despite frequent episodes of severe recurrent pain in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), sensory pain in outpatient adults with SCD lacks sufficient characterization. Furthermore, pivotal barriers may interfere with these patients' adherence to prescribed analgesic therapies but have not been studied systematically. We describe sensory pain characteristics, barriers, and analgesic use reported by adults with SCD during routine clinic visits. Patients (N = 145; 67% female, 94% African American) completed measures on a pen-tablet computer. Patients reported an average of 3.6 +/- 2.3 pain sites; mean current pain intensity (3.3 +/- 3.2), least (3.0 +/- 2.7) and worst (4.9 +/- 3.5) pain intensity in 24 hours on a 0 to 10 scale, multiple neuropathic (4.5 +/- 3.4, 8.3% selected none) and nociceptive (6.8 +/- 4.0) pain descriptors, and continuous pain pattern (59%). Their mean pain barriers score was 2.2 +/- 0.9, and 33% were dissatisfied with their pain levels. Only 14% reported taking at least 1 adjuvant drug, 82% were taking nonopioids, 85% step 2 opioids, and 65% step 3 opioids. Patients reported using, on average, 4.9 +/- 2.7 analgesics. Their pain barriers scores were similar to or greater than people with cancer. Importantly, their pain may be both nociceptive and neuropathic, contrary to common expectations that SCD pain is only nociceptive. Few patients, however, took drugs effective for neuropathic pain.",M2
20136824,"Increased adhesive properties of platelets in sickle cell disease: roles for alphaIIb beta3-mediated ligand binding, diminished cAMP signalling and increased phosphodiesterase 3A activity.Whilst high pro-coagulant activity is reported in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), the precise role of platelets (PLTs) in SCD inflammatory and vaso-occlusive processes is unclear. Adhesion of PLTs from healthy controls (CON), SCD individuals (SCD) and SCD patients on hydroxycarbamide (SCDHC) to fibrinogen (FB) was compared using static adhesion assays. PLT adhesion molecules and intraplatelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (icAMP) were observed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SCD-PLTs demonstrated significantly greater adhesion than CON-PLTs to FB. Participation of the alpha(IIb)beta(3)-integrin in SCD-PLT adhesion was implicated by increased alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation and data showing that an alpha(IIb)beta(3)-function-inhibiting antibody significantly diminished SCD-PLT adhesion to FB. Platelet activation was potentiated by reductions in icAMP; cAMP levels were decreased in SCD-PLTs, being comparable to those of thrombin-stimulated CON-PLTs. Furthermore, SCD-PLT adhesion to FB was significantly reduced by cilostazol, an inhibitor of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A). Both alpha(IIb)beta(3)-integrin activation and icAMP correlated significantly with fetal haemoglobin in SCD. Accordingly, hydroxycarbamide therapy was associated with lower PLT adhesion and higher icAMP. SCD-PLTs may be capable of adhering to proteins encountered on the inflamed vascular wall and, potentially, participate in vaso-occlusive processes. Hydroxycarbamide and, speculatively, nitric oxide donor or cyclic-nucleotide-targeted therapies may aid in the reversal of PLT adhesive properties in SCD.",M2
20135701,"Variability of pulse oximetry measurement over 1 year in children with sickle cell disease depends on initial oxygen saturation measurement.A prospective cohort of children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) was evaluated to determine the variability of daytime pulse oximetry among three measurements over approximately 1 year. Fifty-eight participants were evaluated. Asymptomatic children with initial oxygen saturation &lt; or = 92% had a mean range over 1 year of 4.6% (2.1-7.5%). In contrast, asymptomatic children whose oxygen saturation was &gt;92% had a mean range of 1.9% (0-5.5%). These results suggest, changes in pulse oximetry measurement of approximately 5% may not be clinically significant in otherwise, healthy children with SCD with previous pulse oximetry &lt; or = 92%.",M2
20130127,"Pattern of serum cytokine expression and T-cell subsets in sickle cell disease patients in vaso-occlusive crisis.The pathogenesis of sickle vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients involves the accumulation of rigid sickle cells and the stimulation of an ongoing inflammatory response, as well as the stress of infections. The immune response, via cytokine imbalances and deregulated T-cell subsets, also has been proposed to contribute to the development of VOC. In this study, a panel of high-sensitivity cytokine kits was used to investigate cytokines in the sera of SCD patients in VOC. The results were compared primarily with those for stable SCD patients and secondarily with those for normal healthy people who served as controls. The cytokines studied included interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-10. Lymphocyte subsets of patients with VOC were also studied and were compared with those of both control groups (20 stable patients without crisis [SCD group] and 20 normal healthy controls [NHC]). The VOC group was notable for remarkably elevated levels of IL-4, among the three cytokines tested, compared with those for the SCD and NHC groups. Patients with VOC also differed from stable SCD patients and NHC by having notably lower IL-10 levels, as well as the lowest ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) T cells (0.7). The patterns of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-2 did not differ between VOC and stable SCD patients, but NHC had significantly lower IL-2 levels than both the VOC and SCD groups. Our results demonstrate coexisting levels, both high and low, of TH1- and TH2-type cytokines, as well as diminished levels of T-cell subsets in VOC. These results are discussed in an effort to better understand the importance of the immune system profile in the pathogenesis of sickle cell VOC. Since the possibility that a cytokine imbalance is implicated in the pathogenesis of sickle cell crisis has been raised, our results should prompt further investigation of the host immune response in terms of TH1 and TH2 balance in sickle cell crisis.",M2
20128934,"Cerebral blood flow velocity and language functioning in pediatric sickle cell disease.We investigated the association of increased cerebral blood flow velocity with specific language abilities in children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Thirty-nine children ages 5 to 8 years old with high-risk genotypes of SCD underwent cognitive testing, which included tests of language skills, visual motor skills, and attention/working memory as part of a routine hematology health-maintenance visit. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities were obtained from review of medical records, with the velocities that were in closest temporal proximity to the cognitive assessment used in the analysis. TCD velocities predicted scores on tests of syntactical skills, even when controlling for anemia severity. Semantic and phonological ability and other cognitive skills were not strongly related to TCD velocities. Elevated blood flow velocities in children with high-risk SCD may contribute to a specific language impairment or to a broader dysfunction of short-term and/or working memory. This study underscores the need for clinicians to monitor language skills of children with SCD who have elevated TCD velocities, as these cognitive abilities might be particularly sensitive to cerebrovascular disruption related to their disease.",M2
20120655,"Knowledge of sickle cell disease and haemoglobin electrophoresis: a survey of students of a tertiary institution.BACKGROUND: Sickle Cell Disease (<e>SCD</e>) is the commonest genetic disease worldwide. Of the sickle cell control strategies, premarital genetic counselling is increasingly practised in many countries of the world. Knowledge of the citizenry of a nation about SCD constitutes an important variable that influences the acceptability, practice and success of premarital genetic counselling. A study of students of Benue State University, Makurdi was carried out to determine their current level of knowledge. METHOD: A cross sectional study involving 300 students of Benue State University, Makurdi; selected by a multistage stratified sampling technique, using self administered structured questionnaire, was carried out. RESULTS: Virtually all study respondents had at one time or the other heard about sickle cell disease. Based on the criteria used for knowledge scoring, less than half of the students (48%) demonstrated good knowledge. Overall Mean Score Knowledge (MSK) was 4.65 +/- 1.65. MSK was 4.58 +/- 1.66 and 4.74 +/- 1.64 for males and females respectively; there was no statistically significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). However, having an affected relative suffering from sickle cell disease significantly influenced level of knowledge among study respondents (P &lt; 0.05), but was not significantly associated with respondents knowing their haemoglobin phenotype. Only 141 students (47%) knew their haemoglobin phenotype. Level of knowledge about SCD did not significantly increase with age. Also, sex and religion did not significantly influence level of knowledge. CONCLUSION: The knowledge about SCD was poor and only a few knew their haemoglobin phenotype. If sickle cell disease control strategies must yield any significant results, more education about SCD, especially among students in tertiary institutions in Nigeria is recommended. The use of persons with SCD as peer educators/counsellors should be explored.",M2
20116638,"Recent advances in improving the management of sickle cell disease.Appropriate blood transfusions can both prevent and treat serious complications related to sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), but inevitably lead to iron overload and its complications in terms of morbidity and mortality. Transfusion history and serial serum ferritin level assessments are convenient and cost-effective measures for monitoring iron overload in SCD. Monitoring and treatment of patients with SCD-related iron overload lags behind the standards of care for b-thalassaemia. Data from the EPIC trial suggest suboptimal iron chelation in SCD, highlighting the need to carefully monitor iron levels and initiate iron chelation therapy to avoid serious clinical sequelae. Deferasirox is effective and well tolerated in patients with SCD, including paediatric patients. Patient compliance is, however, important for effectiveness of iron chelation therapy.",M2

Hydroxyurea is a prototypic therapeutic option; it can be administered with minimal side effects, has a relatively wide therapeutic window, and has mechanisms of action that address pathophysiologic pathways of sickling, vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and organ damage. There are limited data regarding hydroxyurea's ability to prevent or diminish organ dysfunction, and the long-term risks of hydroxyurea therapy remain incompletely defined. Although clinical trials are underway to address long-term issues, hydroxyurea remains an effective but underutilized therapy for SCD.",M2
20100764,"Burden of influenza-related hospitalizations among children with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVE: Children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) are considered to be at high risk for complications from influenza infection despite minimal published data that characterize the burden of influenza in this population. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the rate of influenza-related hospitalizations (IRHs) among children with SCD, (2) compare this rate with rates of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and children with neither SCD nor CF, and (3) explore mechanisms that underlie these potentially preventable hospitalizations. METHODS: We analyzed hospitalizations from 4 states (California, Florida, Maryland, and New York) across 2 influenza seasons (2003-2004 and 2004-2005) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. We included hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis code for influenza in a child &lt;18 years of age. We used census data and disease prevalence estimates to calculate denominators and compare rates of IRH among children with SCD, CF, and neither disease. RESULTS: There were 7896 pediatric IRHs during the 2 influenza seasons. Of these, 159 (2.0%) included a co-occurring diagnosis of SCD. Annual rates of IRHs were 112 and 2.0 per 10 000 children with and without SCD, respectively, across both seasons. Children with SCD were hospitalized with influenza at 56 times (95% confidence interval: 48-65) the rate of children without SCD. Children with SCD had approximately double the risk of IRH compared with children with CF (risk ratio: 2.1 [95% confidence interval: 1.5-2.9]). IRHs among children with SCD were not longer, more costly, or more severe than IRHs among children without SCD; they were also rarely nosocomial and co-occurred with a diagnosis of asthma in 14% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: IRHs are substantially more common among children with SCD than among those without the disease, which supports the potential importance of vigorous influenza vaccination efforts that target children with SCD.",M2
20099768,"Estimated incidence of sickle-cell disease in Aruba and St. Maarten suggests cost-effectiveness of a universal screening programme for St. Maarten.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of Sickle-Cell Disease (<e>SCD</e>) in Aruba and St. Maarten and to determine whether universal screening would be cost-effective according to United Kingdom criteria. METHODS: Consecutive cord blood samples were collected in Aruba and the Dutch part of St. Maarten during 3 and 4 months, respectively. Samples were subjected to High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) screening of haemoglobin variants. RESULTS: Of the 368 samples (87.6% of all registered births) collected in Aruba, 10 (2.72%; CI 1.3, 4.9%) tested heterozygous for the Sickle-cell gene (HbAS) and 7 (1.90%; CI 0.8, 3.9%) for the haemoglobin C gene (HbAC). Of the 193 samples (83.5%) collected in St. Maarten, 14 (7.25%; CI 4.0, 11.9%) contained HbAS and 10 (5.18%; CI 2.5, 9.3%) HbAC. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium predicted an incidence of 2.65% for HbAS and 1.86% for HbAC in Aruba and 6.80% for HbAS and 4.86% for HbAC in St. Maarten. These figures imply a newborn rate of about 2 SCD patients per 3 years in Aruba and 2 SCD patients per year in St. Maarten. CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening of newborns for SCD seems cost-effective for St. Maarten.",M2
20093777,"Statins protect against fulminant pneumococcal infection and cytolysin toxicity in a mouse model of sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is characterized by intravascular hemolysis and inflammation coupled to a 400-fold greater incidence of invasive pneumococcal infection resulting in fulminant, lethal pneumococcal sepsis. Mechanistically, invasive infection is facilitated by a proinflammatory state that enhances receptor-mediated endocytosis of pneumococci into epithelial and endothelial cells. As statins reduce chronic inflammation, in addition to their serum cholesterol-lowering effects, we hypothesized that statin therapy might improve the outcome of pneumococcal infection in SCD. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in an experimental SCD mouse model and found that statin therapy prolonged survival following pneumococcal challenge. The protective effect resulted in part from decreased platelet-activating factor receptor expression on endothelia and epithelia, which led to reduced bacterial invasion. An additional protective effect resulted from inhibition of host cell lysis by pneumococcal cholesterol-dependent cytotoxins (CDCs), including pneumolysin. We conclude therefore that statins may be of prophylactic benefit against invasive pneumococcal disease in patients with SCD and, more broadly, in settings of bacterial pathogenesis driven by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the CDC class of toxins produced by Gram-positive invasive bacteria.",M2
20091653,"Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with SCD. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating ACS by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Most recent search: 27 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. MAIN RESULTS: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of blood transfusions as treatment options for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials are now required to assess the benefits and risks of this form of treatment.",M2
20075701,"Glomerular lesions in patients with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is an increasing cause of chronic kidney disease, but the spectrum of glomerular lesions and their underlying mechanisms remain poorly described. We reviewed 18 renal biopsies from patients with SCD and glomerular involvement and studied the expression of hypoxic markers in the biopsy specimens. Four histopathologic variants were distinguished: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (39%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (28%), thrombotic microangiopathy glomerulopathy (17%), and specific sickle cell disease glomerulopathy (17%). Chronic organ damage and history of acute chest syndrome were associated with the occurrence of SCD glomerulopathy. All patients exhibited macroalbuminuria but only 6 patients displayed impaired renal function. SCD was not associated with a specific FSGS histologic variant. Long-term follow-up analysis revealed that 50% of patients exhibited chronic kidney disease. Regardless of the histologic variants, immunohistochemistry did not reveal a specific induction of hypoxic markers (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS], nitrotyrosine, hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF]-1 alpha) at the time of renal biopsy. This large study shows that a wide spectrum of glomerular lesions is associated with SCD. Whatever lesions are observed, the renal prognosis is poor, and early renoprotective treatment is necessary. Hypoxic state does not seem to play a key role in the progression of glomerular lesions, but its potential role at an early stage of glomerular injury requires further investigation.",M2
20064150,"Acute human parvovirus B19 infection and nephrotic syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease.Acute Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is the major cause of transient red cell aplasia (TRCA) and acute anaemia in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). We report three cases of patients who developed nephrotic syndrome (NS) with chronic sequelae after initially presenting with HPV B19-associated TRCA. There was no correlation between evidence of HPV B19 infection and impaired renal function in our cohort of adult sickle cell patients. This is consistent with a view that although NS is potentially a rare complication of symptomatic acute HPV B19 infection, exposure to HPV B19 is not associated with an increased risk of renal disease.",M2
20049931,"Inpatient use of laxatives during opioid administration in children with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Constipation is a frequent adverse drug event seen with opioids, the first-line therapy for sickle cell pain crises. Proactive use of laxatives and stool softeners is recommended when opioids are prescribed. Our objective was to generate national estimates of the inpatient use of laxatives during opioid administration in children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and identify associations between individual and hospital-level factors and laxative prescription. PROCEDURE: We analyzed data from 29 children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System, extracting patients 0-18 years of age with SCD hospitalized between 7/1/2007 and 6/30/2008. Our main outcome measure was the percentage of opioid-receiving patients who also received a laxative or stool softener. RESULTS: Six thousand ninety-three total SCD admissions received opioids. Two-thirds (66%) of patients received at least one laxative, and 31% received more than one. The most commonly prescribed constipation medication was polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (42.0%), followed by docusate (31.4%) and senna (13.6%). Logistic regression revealed that increasing age was associated with increased use of laxatives, as were length of stay &gt;1 day (OR = 3.12), medical as compared to surgical admissions (OR = 4.16), and discharge diagnosis of constipation (OR = 18.6). Patients were somewhat less likely to receive laxatives in small and large volume hospitals as compared to medium hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of hospitalized patients with SCD receiving opioids do not receive laxatives and there is unexpected variability in the use of these medications. Increased attention needs to be paid to constipation prophylaxis in patients with SCD, particularly in younger patients and post-surgical patients.",M2
20040765,"Placenta growth factor in sickle cell disease: association with hemolysis and inflammation.Placenta growth factor (PlGF) is released by immature erythrocytes and is elevated in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Previous data generated in vitro suggest that PlGF may play a role in the pathophysiology of SCD-associated pulmonary hypertension (PHT) by inducing the release of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. In this cross-sectional study of 74 patients with SCD, we confirm that PlGF is significantly elevated in SCD compared with healthy control subjects. We found significantly higher levels of PlGF in SCD patients with PHT but observed no association of PlGF with the frequency of acute pain episodes or history of acute chest syndrome. The observed correlation between PlGF and various measures of red cell destruction suggests that hemolysis, and the resultant erythropoietic response, results in the up-regulation of PlGF. Although relatively specific, PlGF, as well as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, has low predictive accuracy for the presence of PHT. Prospective studies are required to conclusively define the contribution of PlGF to the pathogenesis of PHT and other hemolytic complications in SCD.",M2
20029950,"Cardiopulmonary complications leading to premature deaths in adult patients with sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is associated with early mortality. We sought to determine the incidence, cause, and risk factors for death in an adult population of patients with SCD. All patients aged &gt;/=18 years seen at the Adult Sickle Cell Center at Duke University Medical Center between January 2000 and April 2005 were enrolled. Forty-three patients (21 males and 22 females) died during the study period. The median age of survival was 39 years for females (95% CI: 34-56), 40 years for males (95% CI: 34-48), and 40 years overall (95% CI: 35-48). Cardiac causes of death accounted for 25.6% (11/43 patients); pulmonary, 14.0% (six patients); other SCD related, 32.6% (14 patients); unknown, 14.0% (six patients); and others, 14.0% (six patients). Pulseless electrical activity arrest, pulmonary emboli, multiorgan failure, and stroke were the most frequent causes of death. Among the deceased patients, the most common premorbid conditions were cardiopulmonary: acute chest syndrome/pneumonia (58.1%), Pulmonary hypertension (pHTN; 41.9%), systemic HTN (25.6%), congestive heart failure (25.6%), myocardial infarction (20.9%), and arrhythmias (14.0%). Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity was significantly higher (3.1 m/sec vs. 2.6 m/sec, P &lt; 0.001) and hemoglobin significantly lower (8.3 g/dL vs. 9.2 g/dL, P &lt; 0.05) in deceased patients when compared with patients who lived, respectively. With improved preventive and therapeutic advances, including hydroxyurea therapy, acute complications such as infection are no longer the leading cause of death; instead, causes of death and premorbid conditions are shifting to chronic cardiopulmonary complications. Further, arrhythmia leading to premature death is under-recognized in SCD and warrants further investigation.",M2
20022343,"Prevalence of intracardiac shunting in children with sickle cell disease and stroke.OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of potential intracardiac shunts, including patent foramen ovale (PFO), in children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and stroke. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on 40 children with SCD (39 with hemoglobin SS and 1 with sickle-beta0 thalassemia) and earlier stroke (overt stroke in 30, silent infarction in 10). We compared 3 TTE techniques: conventional 2-dimensional imaging, color Doppler ultrasound, and intravenous agitated saline contrast injection for the detection of intracardiac shunts. We also evaluated the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings of the children with and without shunts. RESULTS: We identified PFO or other potential intracardiac shunts in 10 of 40 children with SCD and earlier stroke (25%; 95% CI, 11.6-38.4). With contrasted TTE, we failed to detect potential shunts in 2 children. In a comparison group of 60 children with stroke but without SCD, retrospective review of clinical echocardiograms identified PFO in 7 of 60 (11.7%; 95% CI, 3.6-19.8). Clinical features significantly associated with the presence of intracardiac shunts were stroke in the setting of vaso-occlusive crisis (P = .026) and headache at stroke onset (P = .014). CONCLUSION: One-quarter of children with SCD and stroke have potential intracardiac shunts. A combination of echocardiographic techniques is required for optimal shunt detection. Intracardiac shunting could be a risk factor for stroke in children with SCD because they are predisposed to thrombosis and elevations of right heart pressure, which could promote paradoxical embolization across an intracardiac shunt.",M2

Well over 120 RHD and over 60 different RHCE alleles have been documented, and new alleles are still being discovered. For clinical transfusion medicine, RH genetic testing can now be used to determine RHD zygosity, resolve D antigen status, and detect altered RHD and RHCE genes in individuals at risk for producing antibodies to high-incidence Rh antigens, particularly patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>).",M2
20008183,"Advances in the use of hydroxyurea.Clinical experience with hydroxyurea for patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) has been accumulating for the past 25 years. The bulk of the current evidence suggests that hydroxyurea is well-tolerated, safe, and efficacious for most patients with SCD. Hydroxyurea has proven clinical efficacy for reducing acute vaso-occlusive events including pain episodes and acute chest syndrome. Salutary effects on hematological parameters include increases in fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hemoglobin, and MCV; also significant decreases occur in WBC, ANC, reticulocytes, LDH, and bilirubin. Treatment with hydroxyurea is usually considered for patients with recurrent vaso-occlusive events, but additional indications for treatment may include laboratory markers of disease severity and evidence of chronic organ dysfunction. Ten years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration approved hydroxyurea for adult patients with clinically severe SCD; however, its use in children remains off-label. Despite the large body of evidence regarding its efficacy and safety, hydroxyurea is currently prescribed only sparingly for patients with SCD and therefore has only limited effectiveness for this disorder; barriers to its use need to be identified and overcome.",M2
20008182,"Novel therapies in sickle cell disease.Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), there remains a paucity of available agents for the prevention and treatment of specific SCD-related complications. Recently, there has been significant progress in the development of novel drugs for this disease. These agents, which increase the production of fetal hemoglobin, improve red blood cell hydration, increase the availability of nitric oxide and possess anti-inflammatory effects, are in varying stages of clinical development. With the complex pathophysiology of SCD, it is unlikely that a single agent will prevent or treat all the sequelae of this disease. As a result, patients may benefit from treatment with a combination of agents that possess different mechanisms of action. This overview discusses selected novel agents that appear promising in SCD.",M2
20008181,"Asthma and sickle cell disease: two distinct diseases or part of the same process?A physician diagnosis of asthma in children and adults with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) has been associated with increased rates of pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS) episodes and premature death. Despite the clinical significance of a doctor's diagnosis of asthma in individuals with SCD, the criteria for a physician diagnosis of asthma are not well defined. Many features of asthma are common in individuals with SCD, including symptoms of wheezing, obstructive lung disease and airway hyper-responsiveness. However, it is not clear if these signs and symptoms of asthma reflect a physician diagnosis of asthma, or if these asthma features are related to SCD. Further complicating the diagnosis of asthma in children with SCD is the significant overlap in clinical manifestations between an asthma exacerbation and an ACS episode. Evidence supporting the concept that asthma and SCD are separate co-morbid conditions includes a similar prevalence of asthma between children with SCD and those in the general population and the observation that asthma is inherited in a familial pattern in the families of children with SCD. In contrast, there is significant evidence that asthma-like features may be associated with SCD without a diagnosis of asthma, including a higher than expected prevalence of airway hyper-responsiveness and obstructive lung disease. Regardless of whether SCD and asthma are distinct or overlapping co-morbid conditions, we recommend a systematic and complete evaluation of asthma when the diagnosis is suspected or when patients have multiple episodes of pain or ACS.",M2
20007516,"Antisickling property of fetal hemoglobin enhances nitric oxide bioavailability and ameliorates organ oxidative stress in transgenic-knockout sickle mice.In sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), the events originating from hemoglobin S polymerization and intravascular sickling lead to reperfusion injury, hemolysis, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is implicated as a contributing factor to multiple organ damage in SCD. We hypothesize that inhibition of sickling by genetic manipulation to enhance antisickling fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression will have an ameliorating effect on oxidative stress by decreasing intravascular sickling and hemolysis and enhancing NO bioavailability. We tested this hypothesis in BERK (Berkeley) mice expressing exclusively human alpha- and beta(S)-globins and varying levels of HbF, i.e., BERK (&lt;1% HbF), BERKgammaM (20% HbF) and BERKgammaH (40% HbF). Intravascular sickling showed a distinct decrease with increased expression of HbF, which was accompanied by decreased hemolysis and increased NO metabolites (NO(x)) levels. Consistent with decreased intravascular sickling and increased NO bioavailability, BERKgammaM and BERKgammaH mice showed markedly decreased lipid peroxidation accompanied by increased activity/levels of antioxidants [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH)] in the muscle, kidney, and liver compared with BERK mice (P &lt; 0.05-0.0001). NO(x) levels showed a strong inverse correlation with hemolytic rate and oxidative stress. Decreased oxidative stress in the presence of elevated HbF levels led to an anti-inflammatory effect as evidenced by decreased peripheral leukocyte counts. These results show that the protective effect of HbF is mediated primarily by decreasing intravascular sickling resulting in decreased oxidative stress and increased NO bioavailability.",M2
20006508,"Morphometry of the thoracolumbar vertebrae in sickle cell disease.Patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) who have deformities and vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis may require surgery. Spinal surgeons must become familiar with the vertebral morphometry of patients with SCD and to that aim we have examined the morphometry of the thoracolumbar spine in these patients. A cohort of 100 patients with SCD was examined using plain thoraco lumbar anteroposterior/lateral radiographs and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Vertebral morphometry (vertebral body diameters, pedicle, spinal canal and deformity) was assessed for different age groups. Results were compared to published studies of healthy subjects. The vertebral dimensions for the 16-20-year and the 21+-year-old groups were significantly smaller for females than males at most spinal levels, while measurements in the 6-10 years and 11-15 years age groups were similar across both sexes at most levels. No significant statistical difference was found between the diameters of the right and left pedicles. With the exception of the sagittal diameter, most of the dimensions of the vertebral bodies measured in SCD patients were less than those of healthy individuals; multiple deformities were also observed. Low bone density was noted in 32 patients. Our data highlight the differences in vertebral bone mineral density, anatomy and deformities in patients with SCD compared to healthy individuals. When considering surgical intervention for patients with SCD, it is important that pre-operative radiography and planning is undertaken, and that the surgeon is familiar with the geometry of the pedicles of the thoracolumbar vertebrae necessary for the safe insertion of pedicle screws. Osteoporosis must be considered when planning surgical interventions in these patients.",M2
20001639,"Sickle cell disease at the dawn of the molecular era.Recent investigations have identified a syndrome of hemolysis-associated vasculopathy in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), which features severe hemolytic anemia that leads to scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) and its biochemical precursor arginine. This diminished bioavailability of NO promotes several clinical sequelae, which includes pulmonary hypertension, cutaneous leg ulceration, priapism, and ischemic stroke. Additional correlates of this vasculopathy include activation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and leukocytes, as well as oxidative stress-related pathways. Some known risk factors for atherosclerosis are also associated with sickle cell vasculopathy, including low levels of apolipoprotein AI and high levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase. Our current understanding of the dysregulated vascular biology pathways in SCD provides a basis for new clinical trials investigating promising targeted therapeutics.",M2
20001631,"Pathophysiology of transfusional iron overload: contrasting patterns in thalassemia major and sickle cell disease.The pathophysiological consequences of transfusional iron overload largely reflect the pattern of excess iron distribution and include cardiomyopathy, endocrinopathy, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the introduction of desferrioxamine (DFO) in the late 1970s, these complications have fallen substantially but approximately half of the chelated adult patients with thalassemia major (TM) still show evidence of increased myocardial iron loading by MRI. An understanding of the factors that determine the propensity to extrahepatic iron distribution may be a key to minimizing the pathophysiological consequences of transfusional iron overload. Transfused patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) appear less likely to develop these extrahepatic complications, possibly because plasma nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) levels are typically lower than in TM patients at matched levels of iron loading. Other mechanisms that may reduce the extrahepatic iron distribution in SCD include raised plasma hepcidin due to chronic inflammation, lower growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels because of less ineffective erythropoiesis (IE), and induction of heme oxygenase (HO1) by intravascular hemolysis. Further understanding of these mechanisms may help in designing strategies to decrease extrahepatic iron distribution in TM.",M2
20001619,"Prevention of hemoglobinopathies in Egypt.The hemoglobin disorders are the most common clinically serious single gene disorders in the world. In Egypt, beta-thalassemia is the most common type with a carrier rate varying from 5.3 to &gt; or =9% and a gene frequency of 0.03. So, it was estimated that 1,000/1.5 million per year live births will suffer from thalassemia disease in Egypt (total live births 1,936,205 in 2006). beta-Thalassemia creates a social and financial burden for the patients' family and the Egyptian government.

Advances in molecular and cellular biology have resulted in an accumulation of knowledge on sickle cell pathophysiology and broadened our understanding of the complexity of this molecular disease with heterogeneous manifestations. Natural history studies and clinical trials have provided incremental data on clinical features, complications, and predictors of severity in SCD and, above all, have laid important recommendations for prevention and treatment of complications. Disease modifying therapies that have significantly improved survival of SCD patients have been identified over recent years. Despite increasingly successful therapies and better overall survival, patients continue to die especially with increasing age and health providers caring for SCD patients face major challenges. This article will highlight modern management of SCD and its impact on the lives of affected patients.",M2
19998646,"A pilot study to explore knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about sickle cell trait and disease.INTRODUCTION: In the United States, newborn screening programs universally identify newborns with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and heterozygote carriers (sickle cell trait [SCT]). Although there is a consensus to disclose SCT to parents, there are limited empirical data about whether and how this information is transmitted to the carrier children. METHODS: In-person questionnaires were administered to parents with SCT and parents of a child with either SCD or SCT to examine the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and disclosure patterns about SCT of parents. RESULTS: Fifty-three adults were interviewed, half (27) of whom had a child with SCD. There was significant misunderstanding about sickle cell inheritance (mean score, 68%), but parents who have a child with SCD have better knowledge compared to those without a child with SCD (78% vs 58%, p = .002). Respondents perceive minimal stigma associated with SCT. Unless there is an affected proband, individuals with SCT rarely receive counseling or education outside of the family. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant misinformation about what it means to be a carrier and its health and reproductive implications. Formal professional counseling is rare, especially for those families without an affected proband. Strategies to increase the utilization of counseling and improve genetic literacy are necessary.",M2
19998636,"Depression, suicidal ideation, and attempts in black patients with sickle cell disease.There is a strong relationship between suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and depression. Rates of successful suicides are relatively high among the chronically ill compared to other populations but are reduced with treatment. Depression and suicide rates also often differ among blacks as compared to other populations. Using survey methods, we evaluated self-reported rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in 30 male and 37 female black patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). SCD is a condition characterized by chronic, unpredictable pains and psychosocial distress. Thirty-six percent of the sample self-reported depression in the past 30 days, while 22 percent of the sample exhibited scores on the Beck Depression Inventory indicative of mild or greater depression (mean BDI, 8.31 +/- 7.79). Twenty-nine percent of patients indicated an episode of suicidal ideation and 8%, a suicidal attempt in their lifetime. Thirty-three percent reported treatment by a mental health professional. We conclude that there is a continuing need for mental health services in the management of depressed affect and risk for suicide among patients with SCD. Standards of clinical care must remain flexible to accommodate the mental health needs of this population of patients.",M2
19995398,"Increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein at baseline are associated with childhood sickle cell vasocclusive crises.Several lines of evidence suggest that sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is associated with a chronic inflammatory state. In this study of 70 children with SCD at steady state evaluated by a broad panel of biomarkers representing previously examined mechanisms of pathogenicity in SCD, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of low-grade, systemic inflammation, emerged as the most significant laboratory correlate of hospitalizations for pain or vaso-occlusive (VOC) events. While markers of increased haemolytic status, endothelial activation and coagulation activation all correlated positively with VOC events by univariate analysis, baseline hs-CRP levels provided the most significant contribution to the association in multiple regression models (22%), and, hs-CRP, along with age, provided the best fit in negative binomial models. These data highlight the clinical relevance of the role of inflammation in paediatric VOC, providing both a rationale for future therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation in microvessel occlusive complications of SCD, and the potential clinical use of hs-CRP as a biomarker in childhood SCD.",M2
19965783,"Human sickle cell blood modulates endothelial heme oxygenase activity: effects on vascular adhesion and reactivity.OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is characterized by extensive hemolysis, increased cellular adhesion, and vaso-occlusion. Tissues from sickle patients express heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the enzyme that degrades free heme/hemoglobin to the signaling molecule carbon monoxide, and the antioxidants biliverdin/bilirubin. Here, we examined the HO response in endothelial cells exposed to human sickle blood and determined whether this response is beneficial for SCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured HO activity in human and bovine aortic endothelial cells incubated with human sickle or normal blood. Sickle blood increased HO activity, which was enhanced by hypoxia and was caused mainly by the red cell components of sickle blood. Oxidized hemoglobin was higher in sickle blood and increased markedly over time. Interestingly, HO activity correlated inversely with patients' hemoglobin levels and positively with bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase. HO-1 induction, exogenous biliverdin, or carbon monoxide markedly decreased adhesion of sickle blood to the endothelium, and sickle red cells partially inhibited relaxation mediated by carbon monoxide in isolated aortas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight important associations between SCD and HO byproducts, which may counteract vascular complications of SCD.",M2
19962576,"Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids may correct severe anemia in hyperhemolytic transfusion reactions: case report and literature review.Hyperhemolytic transfusion reaction (HHTR) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and has been well described in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and non-SCD patients. Awareness of this condition is important because subsequent transfusion may exacerbate hemolysis and may lead to a chronic protracted course or even death. If hemolysis is rapid and severe, subsequent transfusion may be necessary. Additional transfusion has been given together with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids. We report a patient with SCD presented with severe HHTR whose serum contained multiple RBC alloantibodies. On day 2 of admission, the hemoglobin level dropped to 47 g/L. Intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy was commenced. The patient responded and further transfusion was avoided. Review of the literature identified 5 HHTR cases in which transfusion was withheld and IVIG/steroids prescribed. In all of these cases, anemia was corrected and hemolysis resolved without blood transfusion. The reasons why transfusion was withheld and IVIG/steroids treatment prescribed were explored. There is no indication for IVIG in the routine treatment of hemolytic transfusion reactions, but IVIG should be considered as an option for treatment of serious, life-threatening HHTR both in SCD and non-SCD patients.",M2
19955714,"Pattern of bone mineral density in sickle cell disease patients with the high-Hb F phenotype.Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients of all ages due to erythropoietic stress and consequent bone marrow hyperplasia. Kuwaiti SCD patients have a mild clinical phenotype because of their high Hb F level. There has been no previous documentation of BMD in this population of patients. SCD patients (n = 81) and controls (n = 67) were recruited from hematology clinics of Mubarak Hospital, Kuwait. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic) in the lumbar spine and the hip (left femoral neck). Among the 53 adult patients, the prevalence of low BMD was 67.4% in the spine and 33.3% in the hip while among controls, the figures were 23.1 and 11.3%, respectively. These differences are significant (p &lt; 0.01). In SCD children, the figures were 17.9% (in the lumbar spine) and 3.6% (in the hip), while in controls the figures were 13.3 and 0%, respectively. The differences are not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Patients with frequent vaso-occlusive crisis had significantly lower mean BMD, but those with MRI evidence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head were more likely to have normal or osteosclerotic BMD. Our study showed that osteopenia/osteoporosis is uncommon among Kuwaiti children with SCD but quite common in adults.",M2
19954369,"Peripheral arterial tonometry in assessing endothelial dysfunction in pediatric sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: <e>SCD</e> is characterized by hemolysis and oxidative stress, resulting in endothelial dysfunction (EDF). Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT), a noninvasive technology for measuring EDF, utilizes reactive hyperemia following mini-ischemic stress (reactive hyperemia index or RHI). METHODS: The authors studied PAT in 36 SCD children to determine the influence of hemoglobin genotype and treatment on EDF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Blunted RHI was seen in the majority of children with SCD, especially with increased symptomatology (1.53 and 1.71; p value .032). RHI was not normal in children on chronic transfusion or hydroxyurea. RHI correlated with reticulocyte fraction (Spearman r = -.47, p = .037). PAT merits further exploration as a measure of EDF in SCD.",M2
19950747,"Acute normovolemic hemodilution in sickle cell patient--a case report.Sickle cell disease patients with relatively high hemoglobin (&gt; or = 12 g x dl) and those who have elevated alloimmunizations antibodies with rare phenotype subgroups, are problems challenging anesthesiologists. Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) is rarely used in the perioperative management of homozygous sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) in patients undergoing surgery. We hereby present a case in which ANH was used successfully. A 22 year old male patient with known homozygous sickle cell disease undergoing orthopedic surgery, underwent Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) because of the absence of blood and suitable blood donors and high hemoglobin level. Just before establishing spinal anesthesia, a 400 ml blood was extracted from patient and then replaced by 6 % Hydroxyethylstarch HES solution.The surgery was performed uneventfully under spinal analgesia. Patient was discharged 48 hours later. A week later, his follow up visit showed no complications and his lab work returned to basic levels. We recommend the ANH technique as an on hand tool in the perioperative anesthetic management of sickle cell disease patients who have high Hb S with relatively high Hb levels, and in those special patients who have no blood available because of high alloimmunization antibodies or rare phenotype blood groups.",M2
19944213,"Partial splenectomy prevents splenic sequestration crises in sickle cell disease.PURPOSE: Acute splenic sequestrations (SSs) are potentially fatal complications in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Total splenectomies in young patients may predispose them to a higher risk of overwhelming infections, whereas partial splenectomy may maintain immunocompetence. We present our series of partial splenectomies in patients with multiple SS episodes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 6 patients who underwent open partial splenectomies for SS. Data on their clinical courses were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: None of the 6 patients had SS postprocedure, down from 2.1 +/- 1.0 (P = .003) sequestrations per year and 3.5 +/- 1.4 (P = .002) total sequestrations per patient. The transfusion requirements were significantly reduced postoperatively (10.2 +/- 5.6 vs 2.0 +/- 3.1 per year; P = .002). There was no increase in the infection-related hospital admissions during the period of follow-up (1.5 +/- 1.8 vs 0.8 +/- 0.8 per year after partial splenectomy; P = .363). The upper pole was preserved in all cases with blood supply off the main splenic artery. CONCLUSIONS: Partial splenectomy decreases the risk of SS in SCD and reduces the need for blood transfusions. Infection rates did not increase after the procedure during the follow-up period. Partial splenectomy should be considered for patients who experience multiple acute SS crises or have long-term transfusion requirements.",M2
19942462,"Reaction of nitrite with human fetal oxyhemoglobin: a model simulation study with implications for blood flow regulation in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>).Nitrite can react in parallel with adult oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbA), resulting in oxidative denitrosylation of nitrosyl-hemoglobin and rapid dissociation of nitric oxide. Here, simulation studies are presented using a new model to analyze data in the literature comparing the reaction of nitrite with isolated human oxy-HbA, oxy-fetal hemoglobin (oxy-HbF) and oxy-Hb Bart's (a gamma-chain tetramer). The results show that the kinetic constant at the rate-limiting step is 25-fold larger for the reaction of human oxy-HbF, and 63-fold larger for oxy-Hb Bart's both compared to oxy-HbA. This analysis suggests that red cells containing oxy-HbF (F-cells) should have accelerated oxidative denitrosylation. Thus, high levels of HbF present or induced in individuals homozygous for sickle cell disease may serve two functions: (a) the classical function, to directly inhibit polymerization of deoxy sickle hemoglobin, and (b) a novel function, enhanced vasodilation.",M2
19930185,"Successful correction of murine sickle cell disease with reduced stem cell requirements reinforced by fractionated marrow infusions.Minimal criteria requirements of stem cell replacement, conditioning regimen and modalities of infusion essential for cure of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) by bone marrow(BM)/stem cell transplantation or gene therapy must be established prior to clinical trials. The threshold of normal BM/stem cells for therapeutic correction of this red blood cell disorder was evaluated in the SAD murine SCD model from peripheral donor white blood cells. From 11 groups of stable chimeric SAD mice (5-92%) analyzed over approximately 2 years, mice with approximately 16% normal donor stem cells showed improvement of haematological and erythroid responses. Mice in the 26% chimeric group and above demonstrated substantial amelioration of organ pathologies with generalized decreased iron deposits, fibrosis and reached normal lifespan. Subsequently, the minimal myelosuppression concurrently with number and timing of infusions and number of BM cells was determined to reach therapeutic threshold in SAD mice. Higher myelosuppression (2 Gy vs. 1 Gy) and cell number in single infusion led to increased chimerism. Importantly, administration of three-equivalent cell subdoses within 28 h of mild myelosuppression resulted in 100% recipient engraftment at therapeutic levels. These studies established the long-term therapeutic chimeric threshold of normal white blood cells at approximately 26% and determined the minimal fractionated BM/stem cell doses concomitant with mild myelosuppression for significant correction of SCD in SAD mice.",M2
19927623,"Sickle cell disease: a review.The substitution of one amino acid in the hemoglobin molecule results in sickle hemoglobin. As a result, RBCs sickle in low oxygen states causing occlusion of blood vessels, increased viscosity, and inflammation. These RBCs are prematurely removed from the circulation, resulting in a chronic hemolytic anemia. With newborn screening and early treatment, the death rate among children with <e>SCD</e> has declined. In addition, a variety of treatments are being introduced to help manage the various manifestations of disease. Transfusion, simple or exchange, is a mainstay of therapy, since it reduces the amount of Hgb S in circulation and suppresses erythropoiesis. Transfusion is indicated for symptomatic anemia and specifically to prevent stroke (first or recurrent), during acute stroke, and for acute chest syndrome. Unfortunately, transfusion carries risks for infectious disease transmission, as well as immunologic and inflammatory sequelae. For patients with SCD who may be chronically transfused, iron overload occurs frequently. In addition, due to differences in RBC antigens between donors and recipients, these patients are at increased risk for development of RBC alloantibodies, which can complicate further transfusion. It is, therefore, important to prevent alloimmunization by transfusing leukoreduced RBCs that match the patient for the C, E, and K1 antigens. Human progenitor cell (from bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or umbilical blood) transplant can cure the disease, and is used for patients with severe disease for whom conventional therapy may not be effective.",M2
19914412,"In vivo pharmaco-proteomic analysis of hydroxyurea induced changes in the sickle red blood cell membrane proteome.Hydroxyurea (HU) is an effective drug for the treatment of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). The main clinical benefit of HU is thought to derive from its capacity to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. However, other effects leading to clinical benefit, such as improved blood rheology, have been suggested. In order to understand HU-induced changes at the proteomic level, we profiled sickle RBC membranes from of HU-treated and untreated patients. Our previous in vitro profiling studies on sickle RBC membranes identified a significant increase in predominantly anti-oxidant enzymes, protein repair and degradation components and a few RBC cytoskeletal proteins. In the present study, using 2D-DIGE (Two-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis) and tandem mass spectrometry, we detected 32 different proteins that significantly changed in abundance in the HU treatment group. The proteins that significantly increased in abundance were mostly membrane skeletal components involved in the regulation of RBC shape and flexibility, and those showing a significant decrease were components of the protein repair and degradation machinery. RBC palmitoylated membrane protein 55 (p55) is significantly increased in abundance at low (in vitro) and high (in vivo) concentrations of HU. Palmitoylated p55 may be an important target of HU-dependent regulation of the sickle RBC membrane, consistent with our earlier in vitro studies.",M2
19912310,"Feasibility and efficacy of chronic transfusion for stroke prevention in children with sickle cell disease.OBJECTIVES: In children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), chronic transfusion to maintain haemoglobin S (HbS) below 30% markedly decreases both the risk of a first stroke when transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography shows abnormal cerebral blood flow velocities and the risk of recurrent stroke. Maintaining HbS below 30% may be difficult, especially in countries where blood donors and recipients belong to different ethnic groups and where the availability of closely matched blood products is limited. We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of chronic transfusion with an HbS target of 30% in children with SCD living in the Paris area. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 29 children aged 6.8 +/- 3.0 yr (3-15 yr) at inclusion who received chronic transfusion either because of abnormal TCD findings (primary prevention group, PPG, n = 17) or because of a previous cerebrovascular event (secondary prevention group, SPG, n = 12 including nine with a history of stroke and three of transient ischaemic attacks). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 3.5 +/- 3.0 yr (0.5-12 yr). No cases of stroke occurred in the PPG. In the SPG, one patient with a history of stroke and severe cerebrovascular disease had a recurrence after 11 yr of chronic transfusion, when the HbS level was 20%. The stroke recurrence rate (SPG group) was 1.6/100 patient-years. Mean HbS levels before and after transfusion were 30 +/- 10% and 20.6 +/- 7%, respectively. Two patients acquired red-cell alloantibodies. Of the 29 patients, 22 required iron chelation. CONCLUSIONS: Regular transfusion maintaining HbS below 30% is feasible and safe in children with SCD in France and protects from overt stroke.",M2
19912048,"Potential of the Sebia Capillarys neonat fast automated system for neonatal screening of sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Most screening programs for sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) utilize isoelectric focusing (IEF) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect haemoglobin (Hb) variants. The first method is not automated and becomes too tedious when many samples have to be investigated. The aim of this work is to explore the capacity of an automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system, with full traceability, as a tool for newborn screening of SCD. METHODS: The Capillarys neonat fast automated system has been developed by Sebia for newborn screening. We performed separate studies using different types of samples to evaluate the utility of the Capillarys for (i) separating Hb S and other variants, and (ii) for performing the routine activity of our laboratory for 20 working days. RESULTS: A throughput of 48 samples per hour with a loading capacity of 192 samples was achieved. Migration times of the major Hb variants were distinct. There were few variants showing similar migration times to Hb S and Hb C and thalassaemia could be detected. In addition, late screening, screening of premature or transfused babies and screening performed using poor quality Guthrie's cards did not interfere with reporting of accurate phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Sebia Capillarys neonat fast automated system is a reliable tool for haemoglobinopathy neonatal screening.",M2
19908340,"Sickle cell cholangiopathy: an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography evaluation.AIM: To evaluate the role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). METHODS: Two hundred and twenty four SCD patients with cholestatic jaundice (CJ) had ERCP. The indications for ERCP were based on clinical and biochemical evidence of CJ and ultrasound findings. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty ERCPs were performed. The indications for ERCP were: CJ only in 79, CJ and dilated bile ducts without stones in 103, and CJ and bile duct stones in 42. For those with CJ only, ERCP was normal in 42 (53.2%), and 13 (16.5%) had dilated bile ducts without an obstructive cause. In the remaining 22, there were bile duct stones with or without dilation. For those with CJ, dilated bile ducts and no stones, ERCP was normal in 17 (16.5%), and 28 (27.2%) had dilated bile ducts without an obstructive cause. In the remaining 58, there were bile ducts stones with or without dilation. For those with CJ and bile duct stones, ERCP was normal in two (4.8%), and 14 (33.3%) had dilated bile ducts without an obstructive cause. In the remaining 26, there were bile duct stones with or without dilatation. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of biliary sludge and bile duct stones in SCD, endoscopic sphincterotomy might prove helpful in these patients.",M2
19907155,"Iron metabolism and iron chelation in sickle cell disease.This review highlights recent advances in iron metabolism that are relevant to sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). SCD is a common hemoglobinopathy that results in chronic inflammation. Improved understanding of how iron metabolism is controlled by proteins such as hepcidin, ferroportin, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and growth differentiation factor 15 have revealed how they are involved in the organ toxicity of SCD. SCD patients have lower levels of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) relative to other hemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemia. Care for SCD now commonly uses transfusion that results in iron overload and necessitates the need for chelation. New oral chelation therapy using deferasirox (Exjade/ICL670) appears to be safe and may even lower the amount of toxic free NTBI and enhance patient compliance. Finally, we suggest that iron metabolism and trafficking is different in SCD compared to other hemoglobinopathies. The high levels of inflammatory cytokines in SCD may enhance macrophage/reticuloendothelial cell iron and/or renal cell iron retention. This makes the tissues that retain iron different in SCD, and thus the organs that fail in SCD are different from those of other hemoglobinopathies, such as the cardiomyopathy or endocrinopathies of thalassemia.",M2
19903897,"The effect of prolonged administration of hydroxyurea on morbidity and mortality in adult patients with sickle cell syndromes: results of a 17-year, single-center trial (LaSHS).The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Thirty-four patients with sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin S [HbS]/HbS), 131 with HbS/beta(0)-thal, and 165 with HbS/beta(+)-thal participated in this trial. HU was administered to 131 patients, whereas 199 patients were conventionally treated. The median follow-up period was 8 years for HU patients and 5 years for non-HU patients. HU produced a dramatic reduction in the frequency of severe painful crises, transfusion requirements, hospital admissions, and incidence of acute chest syndrome. The probability of 10-year survival was 86% and 65% for HU and non-HU patients, respectively (P = .001), although HU patients had more severe forms of SCD. The 10-year probability of survival for HbS/HbS, HbS/beta (0)-thal, and HbS/IVSI-110 patients was 100%, 87%, and 82%, respectively, for HU patients and 10%, 54%, and 66%, for non-HU patients. The multivariate analysis showed that fetal hemoglobin values at baseline and percentage change of lactate dehydrogenase between baseline and 6 months were independently predicted for survival in the HU group. These results highlight the beneficial effect of HU, which seems to modify the natural history of SCD and raise the issue of expanding its use in all SCD patients.",M2
19902523,"Definitions of the phenotypic manifestations of sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder of hemoglobin that has profound multiorgan effects. The low prevalence of SCD ( approximately 100,000/US) has limited progress in clinical, basic, and translational research. Lack of a large, readily accessible population for clinical studies has contributed to the absence of standard definitions and diagnostic criteria for the numerous complications of SCD and inadequate understanding of SCD pathophysiology. In 2005, the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers initiated a project to establish consensus definitions of the most frequently occurring complications. A group of clinicians and scientists with extensive expertise in research and treatment of SCD gathered to identify and categorize the most common complications. From this group, a formal writing team was formed that further reviewed the literature, sought specialist input, and produced definitions in a standard format. This article provides an overview of the process and describes 12 body system categories and the most prevalent or severe complications within these categories. A detailed Appendix provides standardized definitions for all complications identified within each system. This report proposes use of these definitions for studies of SCD complications, so future studies can be comparably robust and treatment efficacy measured. Use of these definitions will support greater accuracy in genotype-phenotype studies, thereby achieving a better understanding of SCD pathophysiology. This should nevertheless be viewed as a dynamic rather than final document; phenotype descriptions should be reevaluated and revised periodically to provide the most current standard definitions as etiologic factors are better understood, and new diagnostic options are developed.",M2

19890898,"HLA alloimmunization is associated with RBC antibodies in multiply transfused patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: Alloimmunization to minor red blood cell (RBC) antigens occurs commonly in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Patients with alloimmunization demonstrate increased risk for new alloantibody formation with subsequent transfusion. Alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) can occur with RBC transfusion and may result in graft rejection during stem cell or organ transplantation. The prevalence and risk factors for HLA alloimmunization in multiply transfused pediatric SCD patients are unknown. PROCEDURE: A cross-sectional study of HLA alloimmunization in SCD patients aged 3-21 years with a history of &gt;or=3 RBC transfusions was performed to test the hypothesis that HLA alloimmunization is associated with RBC alloimmunization. Antibodies to class I and class II HLA were measured by Flow Panel Reactive Antibody (FlowPRA). RESULTS: Seventy-three SCD patients (30 with RBC antibodies) were tested. HLA antibodies were detected in 25/73 (34%) patients; class I HLA antibodies occurred in 24/73 (33%) and class II HLA antibodies occurred in 3 (4%). Among patients with RBC antibodies, 16/30 (53%) had HLA antibodies, while 9/43 (21%) patients without RBC antibodies had HLA antibodies (OR 4.32 [1.6-12.1]). In a multivariate analysis, antibodies to RBC antigens were an independent predictor of HLA alloimmunization (P = 0.041). The association of RBC and HLA immunization was strongest among patients with no history of chronic transfusion therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is the first description of HLA alloimmunization in pediatric SCD patients who receive primarily leukoreduced RBC transfusions and demonstrates that HLA alloimmunization tendency is associated with antibodies to RBC antigens.",M2
19885711,"Septic arthritis in adults with sickle cell disease often is associated with osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis.BACKGROUND: Septic arthritis is a known complication of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) in children, and the association with osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis has been described. However, it is unclear whether this association applies to adults. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore asked whether septic arthritis is a frequent complication in adults with SCD and whether it also is associated with osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 2000 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with SCD and recorded symptoms, select findings during physical examination, laboratory data, and select radiographic CT, and MRI observations. RESULTS: Fifty-nine of the 2000 patients (3%) had septic arthritis, 56 of the 59 patients had hemoglobin SS. Thirty-six of the 59 infections (61%) were in the hip. The most frequent findings were pain, swelling, fever greater than 38.2 degrees C (71% of cases), a leukocyte count exceeding 15,000/mm(3) (range, 7900-32,300/mm(3)), a Westergren sedimentation rate greater than 24 mm/hour, and C-reactive protein exceeding 20 mg/L. Cultures were positive in 96% of the joint aspirates. Staphylococcus and Gram-negative infection predominated; no patients had Salmonella joint infections. Preexisting factors of bacterial arthritis included osteonecrosis (29 patients) and osteomyelitis (37 cases) in childhood. Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, glucocorticoids, and immunoparesis related to medical treatment by hydroxyurea were associated comorbidities. CT and MRI confirmed the diagnosis of associated osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis and allowed joint aspiration and detection of soft tissue abscess. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of septic arthritis in adults with SCD is low, but often is associated with osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

19876910,"Maternal knowledge and attitudes about newborn screening for sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.Illinois introduced mandatory newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) in 1989 and for cystic fibrosis (CF) in 2008. We examined maternal understanding of NBS for SCD and CF, and their knowledge of the genetics, symptoms, and treatments of both conditions. Our methods consisted of conducting interviews of inpatient post-partum women (&gt;18 years and English speaking). Our results showed that of the 388 eligible participants, 34 self-identified as sickle cell carriers, 1 with SCD and 1 as a CF carrier. Almost 3/4 were African American (282/387). Although all but 5 women had prenatal care, only 35% (133/378) recalled their prenatal care provider mentioning NBS, and only 56% (217/388) of participants recalled nursery staff mentioning NBS. There was more self-reported familiarity with SCD (3.32/5) than CF (1.97/5, P &lt; 0.001). Over 2/3 (260/388) of participants could not answer CF knowledge questions because they had never heard of CF. Among those who had heard of the conditions, mean knowledge scores were 66% for SCD (n = 372) and 63% for CF (n = 128). Bivariate analysis identified education, age, race, marital status, and insurance status as statistically significant. After linear regression education remained significant for both conditions. We conclude that in a sample of predominantly African American post-partum women, we found poor understanding of NBS, greater familiarity with SCD, and significant knowledge gaps for both SCD and CF. There are many missed educational opportunities for educating parents about NBS and specific conditions included in NBS panels in both the obstetric clinics and the nursery.",M2
19860302,"A systematic review of barriers and interventions to improve appropriate use of therapies for sickle cell disease.Clinical experts have expressed concern about underutilization of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) therapies, including hydroxyurea, prophylactic antibiotics, iron chelation, bone marrow transplantation, pain management during vaso-occlusive crisis, and receipt of routine ambulatory health care. We synthesized studies that identified barriers to and interventions to improve appropriate use of these therapies. Of the 48 studies included in our review, 35 identified therapeutic barriers or facilitators, and 13 evaluated interventions to improve use of therapies. Consistently identified barriers to appropriate pain management were negative provider attitudes and lack of provider knowledge. Four of 9 pain management interventions improved direct measures of pain management quality, while 5 improved indirect measures. One intervention improved receipt of routine ambulatory care. We concluded that interventions to improve pain management in SCD can be effective and should address providers' negative attitudes and knowledge and that more intervention studies are needed to improve receipt of recommended SCD therapies.",M2
19844839,"Validation of the SF-36 in Jamaicans with sickle-cell disease.Quality-of-life (QOL) measurements are becoming a vital part of health outcome appraisal. Sickle-cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) places a substantial burden on those afflicted. No QOL measure has been validated for use in Jamaica. The SF-36 version 2 was administered to two samples of patients with SCD: the 'Cohort' (n = 233), and the 'Main' samples (n = 256). All patients were also administered the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL-Bref), Flanagan's Quality-of-Life Scale (QOLS), and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. All measures were found to be reliable with coefficient alphas' ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. The total SF-36 score showed a strong positive correlation with the total WHOQOL-Bref (0.78) and a moderate one with the total QOLS score (0.57). The correlations of the total scores from the SF-36 scale with those from the Loneliness Scale were negative but moderate in size (-0.59). This study provides fair evidence for the concurrent, and some evidence for the discriminant, validity of the SF-36 in Jamaicans with SCD.",M2
19835723,"Contraceptive usage among Jamaican women with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The usage of contraceptive methods in young women with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) and the factors affecting usage are unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Young women (N=132) with SCD attending the Sickle Cell Unit were interviewed regarding their contraceptive usage. SPSS version 12 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-four (48%) of women with SCD were using a contraceptive method. The more commonly used methods were condoms (n=25, 39%) and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (n=18, 28%). Of the nonusers, 52% were not sexually active. The reasons for nonusage in sexually active women included the desire to become pregnant (17), belief that they were unable to get pregnant (11) and health concerns (7). A majority had been informed about contraceptive methods by a trained professional. Sixty-seven percent agreed with at least one of the common Jamaican myths regarding contraceptive usage. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 92% of these women with SCD were using contraceptive methods or had reason not to do so. Subjects had been educated about contraceptive methods and appeared to be uninfluenced by local myths regarding contraceptive usage.",M2
19827138,"Pulmonary hypertension in children and young adults with sickle cell disease: evidence for familial clustering.BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is increasingly recognized as a serious complication of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Our objective was to determine the prevalence of PHTN and identify factors associated with PHTN among children and young adults with SCD in Lebanon. PROCEDURE: From June 2004 to June 2008, 90 patients were studied. Correlation of TRV with LDH, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hydroxyurea use, and G6PD deficiency was performed. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was performed during steady-state at each patient's initial visit and yearly thereafter. PHT was defined as a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) &gt; or =2.5 m/sec. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (31.8%) were found to have PHTN. They had significantly higher LDH levels (P = 0.008) and MCV (P = 0.024). There was a higher percentage of patients on hydroxyurea in the group with PHTN (78% vs. 50%, P = 0.015). Furthermore, five children, mean age 9.8 years (range, 6-13 years), with initially normal TRV developed PHTN while on hydroxyurea for at least 3 years, at a mean dose of 19.2 mg/kg/day (range, 14-24). PHTN clustered in families and was found in all members with SCD in 7 of the 21 families studied; they contributed 16 of the 27 patients with PHTN. None of the 21 patients with PHTN were G6PD deficient compared to 4 of 36 without PHTN. CONCLUSIONS: PHTN was common, associated with increased hemolysis but not G6PD deficiency, and clustered in families. Moreover, PHTN developed despite hydroxyurea therapy in five patients.",M2
19822218,"Pulmonary, gonadal, and central nervous system status after bone marrow transplantation for sickle cell disease.We conducted a prospective, multicenter investigation of human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in children with severe sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) between 1991 and 2000. To determine if children were protected from complications of SCD after successful BMT, we extended our initial study of BMT for SCD to conduct assessments of the central nervous system (CNS) and of pulmonary function 2 or more years after transplantation. In addition, the impact on gonadal function was studied. After BMT, patients with stroke who had stable engraftment of donor cells experienced no subsequent stroke events after BMT, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams demonstrated stable or improved appearance. However, 2 patients with graft rejection had a second stroke after BMT. After transplantation, most patients also had unchanged or improved pulmonary function. Among the 11 patients who had restrictive lung changes at baseline, 5 were improved and 6 had persistent restrictive disease after BMT. Of the 2 patients who had obstructive changes at baseline, 1 improved and 1 had worsened obstructive disease after BMT. There was, however, significant gonadal toxicity after BMT, particularly among female recipients. In summary, individuals who had stable donor engraftment did not experience sickle-related complications after BMT, and were protected from progressive CNS and pulmonary disease.",M2
19821949,"Red blood cell alloimmunization in sickle cell disease patients in Uganda.BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion is an integral part in the management of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients. Alloimmunization is a recognized complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions with consequences including delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and difficulties in getting compatible blood for future transfusions. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of RBC alloimmunization in SCD patients in Uganda where pretransfusion screening for alloantibodies is not practiced. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, SCD patients at Mulago Hospital Sickle Cell Clinic, Kampala, Uganda, were investigated. The demographic characteristics and transfusion history were recorded. Blood samples were drawn from consenting, previously transfused patients and RBC alloimmunization was demonstrated using immunohematologic techniques. RESULTS: There were 428 patients (median age, 12 years; female/male ratio, 1.0) and they had received a median of 3 units in a median of three transfusion episodes. Twenty-six patients (6.1%) possessed RBC alloantibodies and 21 (80.7%) of them had received up to 10 transfusions. A total of 30 alloantibodies was found; 20 (66.7%) and 5 (16.6%) belonged to Rh and MNS blood groups, respectively. Five of the alloimmunized patients had multiple antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of RBC alloimmunization in Ugandan SCD patients was 6.1%. The homogeneity between donors and SCD patients plus the low transfusion load may explain this immunization frequency. Nevertheless, our study confirms the significance of RBC alloimmunization as a complication in Ugandan SCD patients. Therefore, there is need to improve immunohematologic testing in Uganda so that RBC alloimmunization and its consequences may be prevented.",M2
19819341,"Severe sickle cell disease--pathophysiology and therapy.Over 70,000 people live with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) in the United States and multitudes worldwide. About 2000 afflicted babies are born in this country each year. In African countries such as Nigeria, over 100,000 babies are born with the disease each year. Great strides have been made in the conservative management of SCD. However, the medical and psychosocial cost of supporting patients with this chronic illness is enormous and spans a lifetime. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can abrogate SCD manifestations, and is the best option for cure today. Yet, this treatment modality is underutilized as less than 500 transplants are reported in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database because of its significant risk of morbidity and mortality. There is growing understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, and this, coupled with advances in transplantation and new approaches to therapy, continue to improve care of patients with SCD both in children and during adulthood. Continuing investigation seeks to predict the course of the disease and to determine timing and modality of therapy in order to optimize outcomes.",M2
19816012,"Elevated circulating stromal-derived factor-1 levels in sickle cell disease.Inflammation and angiogenesis are of importance in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>). Recently, the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) has been shown to be a key mediator of angiogenesis and inflammation. In this study we determined serum SDF-1 levels in consecutive adult sickle cell patients during the clinically asymptomatic state as well as during painful crisis. Serum SDF-1 levels were significantly elevated in HbSS/HbSbeta(0)-thalassaemia patients [n = 42; 5,177 pg/ml (2,438-7,246)] compared to HbSC/HbSbeta(+)-thalassaemia patients [n = 16; 2,405 pg/ml (1,365-3,047)] and healthy HbAA controls [n = 45; 2,894 pg/ml (2,577-3,334)] (p = 0.001). No significant increments were observed during painful crisis (n = 40). SDF-1 levels were significantly higher in SCD patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) compared to patients without PHT. Elevated circulating SDF-1 levels occur in patients with SCD and may play a role in the pathophysiology of SCD-related PHT.",M2

19799864,"Plasma annexin A5 and microparticle phosphatidylserine levels are elevated in sickle cell disease and increase further during painful crisis.Expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the membrane surface of red blood cells and circulating microparticles (MP) plays an important role in etiology of the hypercoagulable state of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), as well as in the reduced red cell life span and adhesive interactions between red cells and endothelium. Annexin A5, an intracellular protein abundantly present in endothelial cells and platelets, exhibits high affinity for PS and has been shown to inhibit several of these PS-mediated pathophysiological processes. We determined plasma annexin A5 levels and MP-associated procoagulant activity, a measure of MP-PS exposure, in 17 sickle cell patients (12 HbSS and 5 HbSC) in steady state and at presentation with a painful crisis. Twenty-five HbAA blood donors served as controls. Both annexin A5 and MP-PS were highest in HbSS patients (5.7 ng/mL, IQR 3.7-7.6 and 37.9 nM, IQR 31.9-69.8) as compared to HbSC patients (1.8 ng/mL, IQR 1.7-7.6 and 20.9 nM, IQR 10.9-29.6) and healthy controls (2.5 ng/mL, IQR 1.4-4.4 and 13.1 nM, IQR 9.5-18.5) (p=0.01 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). At presentation with a painful crisis, annexin A5 and MP-PS had increased in 16 of 17 patients (p=0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Most interestingly, in 7 HbSS patients the proportional increase in MP-PS exposure was higher than the proportional increase in plasma annexin A5 concentration, leading to lower annexin A5/MP-PS ratio of HbSS patients during crisis than HbAA controls (0.0027 (0.0017-0.0049) vs 0.0048 (0.0027-0.0085), p=0.05). In conclusion, patients with SCD have elevated plasma levels of annexin A5- and PS-exposing MP. During crisis both levels increase, but in most HbSS patients MP-PS exposure increases more than annexin A5. Future studies must address a potential role of annexin A5 in modulating PS-related pathophysiological processes in SCD.",M2
19797523,"Sickle cell disease and stroke.Twenty-four percent of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients have a stroke by the age of 45 years. Blood transfusions decrease stroke risk in patients deemed high risk by transcranial Doppler. However, transcranial Doppler has poor specificity, and transfusions are limited by alloimmunization and iron overload. Transfusion withdrawal may be associated with an increased rebound stroke risk. Extended blood typing decreases alloimmunization in SCD but is not universally adopted. Transfusions for thalassemia begun in early childhood are associated with lower rates of alloimmunization than are seen in SCD, suggesting immune tolerance. Optimal oxygen transport efficiency occurs at a relatively low hematocrit for SCD patients because of hyperviscosity. Consequently, exchange rather than simple transfusions are more effective in improving oxygen transport efficiency, but the former are technically more demanding and require more blood units. Although viscosity is of importance in the noncerebral manifestations of SCD, inflammation may play a larger role than viscosity in the development of large-vessel stroke. The future of SCD stroke management lies in the avoidance of transfusion. Hydroxyurea and anti-inflammatory measures may reduce the need for transfusion. Recent genome-wide association studies may provide methods for modulating fetal hemoglobin production enough to attenuate stroke risk and other complications of SCD.",M2
19793944,"Clinical obligations and public health programmes: healthcare provider reasoning about managing the incidental results of newborn screening.BACKGROUND: Expanded newborn screening generates incidental results, notably carrier results. Yet newborn screening programmes typically restrict parental choice regarding receipt of this non-health serving genetic information. Healthcare providers play a key role in educating families or caring for screened infants and have strong beliefs about the management of incidental results. METHODS: To inform policy on disclosure of infant sickle cell disorder (<e>SCD</e>) carrier results, a mixed-methods study of healthcare providers was conducted in Ontario, Canada, to understand attitudes regarding result management using a cross-sectional survey (N = 1615) and semistructured interviews (N = 42). RESULTS: Agreement to reasons favouring disclosure of SCD carrier results was high (65.1%-92.7%) and to reasons opposing disclosure was low (4.1%-18.1%). Genetics professionals expressed less support for arguments favouring disclosure (35.3%-78.8%), and more agreement with arguments opposing disclosure (15.7%-51.9%). A slim majority of genetics professionals (51.9%) agreed that a reason to avoid disclosure was the importance of allowing the child to decide to receive results. Qualitatively, there was a perceived  duty  to disclose, that if the clinician possessed the information, the clinician could not withhold it. DISCUSSION: While a majority of respondents perceived a duty to disclose the incidental results of newborn screening, the policy implications of these attitudes are not obvious. In particular, policy must balance descriptive ethics (ie, what providers believe) and normative ethics (ie, what duty-based principles oblige), address dissenting opinion and consider the relevance of moral principles grounded in clinical obligations for public health initiatives.",M2

Iron deposition in the heart, liver and pancreas was assessed using T2* MRI sequences, as well as free iron species assays - non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and labile plasma iron (LPI), in addition to serum ferritin, percentage transferrin saturation and serum hepcidin, in 10 multitransfused patients (&gt;30 yr) with sickle/beta(0)-thalassaemia. None of the patients had iron deposition in the heart. Three patients had mild, one had moderate, and two had severe liver IO. Two patients had mild iron deposition in the pancreas. In all the patients, serum hepcidin levels were normal - NTBI and LPI were not detected. Possible explanations of these findings are discussed.",M2
19787790,"Outcomes of inpatients with and without sickle cell disease after high-volume surgical procedures.In this study, we examined differences in inpatient costs, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality between hospitalizations for patients with and without sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) undergoing high-volume surgical procedures. We used Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes to identify discharges in the 2002-2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for patients who had undergone either cholecystectomy or hip replacement. We limited the non-SCD cohort to hospitals where patients with SCD had undergone the same procedure. We compared inpatient outcomes using summary statistics and generalized linear regression analysis to adjust for patient, hospital, and procedural characteristics. Overall, the median age of surgical patients with SCD was more than three decades less than the median age of patients without SCD undergoing the same procedure. In recognition of the age disparity, we limited the analyses to patients aged 18 to 64 years. Nonetheless, patients with SCD undergoing cholecystectomy or hip replacement were 12.1 and 14.4 years younger, had inpatient stays that were 73% and 82% longer, and incurred costs that were 46% and 40% higher per discharge than patients without SCD, respectively. Inpatient mortality for these procedures was low, approximately 0.6% for cholecystectomy and 0.2% for hip replacement and did not differ significantly between patients with and without SCD. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that higher inpatient costs among patients with SCD were primarily attributable to longer hospital stays. Patients with SCD who underwent cholecystectomy or hip replacement required more health care resources than patients without SCD. Am. J. Hematol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",M2
19778340,"Partial C antigen in sickle cell disease patients: clinical relevance and prevention of alloimmunization.BACKGROUND: Partial Rh antigens have been widely described in black individuals. Carriers are prone to immunization when exposed to the normal antigens. In sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), patient alloimmunization is a major cause of transfusion failure. The potential of individuals with partial C antigen to make anti-C has not been investigated. We sought partial C status and anti-C production in a cohort of SCD patients with the C+ phenotype, to determine whether exposure to normal C antigen should be avoided. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We constituted a cohort of 177 randomly selected SCD patients expressing C antigen. We screened for (C)ce(s) and R(N) haplotypes, presumably associated with partial C antigen in Afro-Caribbeans, and we recorded the number of transfused C+ red blood cell (RBC) units, immunization status, and extended phenotype. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients carried abnormal C antigen, deduced from the presence of (C)ce(s) and/or R(N), not compensated by a normal RHC allele in trans. Among patients with partial C phenotype exposed repeatedly to C+ RBCs, 30% produced anti-C. Two patients experienced hemolysis. In our hospital, with 22% of SCD patients expressing C, prevention of anti-C immunization for all individuals with partial C antigen would require a 7% increase in the use of C- RBC units. These RBCs are already in short supply for SCD patients who are C-. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the need to detect partial C within C+ SCD patients and to prevent immunization. A larger number of Afro-Caribbeans donors is needed to provide these patients with C- RBCs.",M2
19775370,"HLA-G polymorphism influences the susceptibility to HCV infection in sickle cell disease patients.Despite its well known monogenic etiopathogenesis, sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) is characterized by a striking variability of clinical presentation. There is growing evidence that genetic factors may be involved in this variability. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G is a non-classical HLA molecule which was shown to be expressed at sites of inflammation and in inflammatory diseases. Besides its large and highly polymorphic promoter region, the 3' UTR region seems also to play an important role on regulating HLA-G expression. We investigated the influence of the 14 pb (rs1704) and the +3142 (rs1063320) HLA-G polymorphisms in 93 SCD patients in order to evaluate its potential role on clinical parameters. Twenty-one patients presented an HCV infection. Among all SCD patients 16 (22.2%) were homozygous for the +3142C genotype, none of them hepatitis C (HCV) positive. Controlling for blood transfusions in the last year, the C allele represented a dose dependent protection effect for HCV infection (PR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24-0.71). The +3142C allele was also underrepresented among patients with history of respiratory-tract infections. Our results support a role of the +3142 polymorphism in the susceptibility to infections, in particular to HCV infection, and suggest a possible interference of the HLA-G molecule in the response to infections, among SCD patients.",M2
19737308,"Absence of cardiac siderosis by MRI T2* despite transfusion burden, hepatic and serum iron overload in Lebanese patients with sickle cell disease.BACKGROUND: The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect organ-specific iron overload is becoming increasingly common. Although hepatic iron overload has been recognized in patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), cardiac iron deposition has only been examined in a few reports. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 23 patients with SCD. Patient charts were reviewed and data collected for drug use, total lifetime transfusions (TLT), transfusion rate (TR), status of the spleen, and comorbid illnesses or infections. Blood samples were obtained for assessment of hemoglobin, serum ferritin, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), and liver enzyme levels. Doppler echocardiography was performed to detect pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and assess left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac iron levels were measured by MRI T2*. Direct determination of liver iron concentration (LIC) was performed using R2 MRI. In this study, cardiac T2* &gt;20 ms was considered normal. RESULTS: The mean age was 24.4 +/- 9.7 yr, with a male to female ratio of 15:8. A total of 9 (49.9%) patients were splenectomized. The mean TR was 14.1 +/- 13.2 Units/yr, and the mean hemoglobin level was 9.0 g/dL. PHT was detected in 6 (27.3%) patients, but none had evidence of heart failure. The mean serum ferritin, LIC, and NTBI levels were 997.7 ng/mL, 4.6 mg Fe/g dw, and 1.1 +/- 2.2, respectively. TR was a much better predictor of iron burden (LIC, ferritin, NTBI) than TLT. In fact, TR less than 10 Units/yr did not produce significant iron overload reflecting spontaneous losses as high as 0.11 mg/kg/d. None of the patients had evidence of cardiac iron overload (mean cardiac T2* = 37.3 +/- 6.2 ms; range: 21.9-46.8 ms). There was also no statistically significant correlation between cardiac T2* values and any of the study variables. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that TR is a stronger predictor of iron overload than TLT. It also confirms cardiac sparing in patients with SCD, even in subjects with significant transfusion burden, systemic and hepatic iron overload.",M2
19732137,"Non-transferrin-bound labile plasma iron and iron overload in sickle-cell disease: a comparative study between sickle-cell disease and beta-thalassemic patients.BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions are the standard of care in b thalassemia and transfusions are also indicated in sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) patients with hypersplenism, recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and for stroke prevention. Iron overload caused by blood transfusions in thalassemia and in SCD may affect morbidity and mortality. Recent studies of iron overload in SCD suggest that the biologic features of SCD and the chronic inflammatory state may protect SCD patients from iron damage. DESIGNS AND METHODS: In view of the controversy regarding the effect of iron overload in patients with SCD we studied the iron status, including non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) and labile plasma iron (LPI) levels in a cohort of 36 SCD patients and compare the results with 43 thalassemia patients. RESULTS: Our results indicate that none of the SCD patients had clinical symptoms of iron overload. Only two SCD patients had NTBI values in the gray zone (0.4 units) and none had positive values. By contrast, 14 patients with thalassemia major and three with thalassemia intermedia had NTBI values above 0.6, level that are in the positive pathological range. Similarly, four thalassemia patients, but only one SCD patient had positive LPI levels. CONCLUSIONS: The parameters of iron status in SCD patients, even after frequent transfusions are different when compared to patients with thalassemia. The low NTBI and LPI levels found in patients with SCD are in keeping with the absence of clinical signs of iron overload in this disease.",M2
19731327,"Behavioral and emotional problems in children with sickle cell disease and healthy siblings: Multiple informants, multiple measures.BACKGROUND: Behavioral and emotional problems in children with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) may be related to disease factors, or to socio-demographic factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in children with SCD living in a Western European country, compared to healthy siblings (who were comparable in age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status-SES), and to a Dutch norm population. METHODS: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF) and Disruptive Behavior Disorders rating scale (DBD) were distributed among caregivers and teachers of 119 children with SCD aged 6-18 years and among caregivers and teachers of 38 healthy siblings. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by caregivers and/or teachers of 106 children with SCD and 37 healthy siblings. According to caregivers and teachers, children with SCD had more severe internalizing problems than healthy siblings and the norm population. According to teachers, subgroups of both children with SCD and healthy siblings had more severe externalizing problems than the norm population. Children with SCD had more difficulties than healthy siblings in terms of school functioning, showed less competent social behavior and tended to have more attention deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SCD are at increased risk of developing internalizing problems as a result of their disease. Subgroups of children with SCD are at increased risk of developing severe externalizing problems, which may either be related to socio-demographic factors, or to disease factors, such as neurocognitive deficits associated with cerebral infarction.",M2

During a 3-month period in 2006/2007, 520 samples of umbilical cord blood were obtained through neonatal screening in five health centres in Kisangani. The samples were analysed using an isoelectric focusing technique. The estimated prevalence of sickle cell trait and SCD in the population tested was 23.3 and 0.96%, respectively. These numbers will be presented for the attention of the health authorities in DRC with responsibility for SCD and they will be asked to consider improvements in treatment procedures for SCD, such as blood transfusions, as a public health priority.",M2
19775299,"Endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell disease.Pulmonary Hypertension is a serious complication of sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>), with high morbidity and mortality. Endothelin (ET)-1, a potent vasoconstrictor elevated in SCD, acts through the ET receptors (ETR), ETR-A and ETR-B. Bosentan and ambrisentan are ETR blockers used in primary pulmonary hypertension. We report on the use of ETR blocking agents in a cohort of 14 high-risk SCD adult patients with pulmonary hypertension. Patients underwent right heart catheterization, 6-min walk test, echocardiogram, physical examination and blood work-up before starting ETR blockers. Eight patients received ETR blockers as initial therapy; six patients were already taking sildenafil. Over more than 6 months of therapy, sequential measurements of 6-min walk distance increased significantly (baseline 357 +/- 22 to 398 +/- 18 m at 5-6 months, P &lt; 0.05). Downward trends were observed for amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide and tricuspid regurgitant velocity. Pulmonary artery mean pressures decreased in three patients that had repeat right heart catheterization (44-38 mmHg). Adverse events were: increased serum alanine aminotransferase (2), peripheral oedema (4), rash (1), headache (3), decreased haemoglobin (2). Therapy was stopped in two patients who were switched then to the other ETR blocker agent. These data suggest preliminary evidence for the benefit of bosentan and ambrisentan in pulmonary hypertension in SCD.",M2
19743465,"The course and correlates of high hospital utilization in sickle cell disease: Evidence from a large, urban Medicaid managed care organization.Although most patients with sickle cell disease (<e>SCD</e>) are hospitalized infrequently and manage painful crises at home, a small subpopulation is frequently admitted to emergency departments and inpatient units. This small group accounts for the majority of health care expenses for patients with SCD. Using inpatient claims data from a large, urban Medicaid MCO for 5 consecutive years, this study sought to describe the course of high inpatient utilization (averaging four or more admissions enrolled per year for at least 1 year) in members with a diagnosis of SCD and a history of hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive crisis. High utilizers were compared with the other members with SCD on demographics, medical and psychiatric comorbidity, and use of other health care resources. Members who were high utilizers had more diagnostic mentions of sickle cell complications than low utilizers. However, the pattern of high inpatient utilization was likely to moderate over successive years, and return to the pattern after moderation was uncommon. Despite this, a small subpopulation engaged in exceptional levels of inpatient utilization over multiple years.",M2
